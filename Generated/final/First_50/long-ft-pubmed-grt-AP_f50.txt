 the cross - correlation formalism for anisotropic circularly polarized sgwb is generalized to deal with anisotropy in a stochastic gravitational wave background. we describe the angular separation between the two pulsars @xmath3 mode and @xmm2 mode by using the generalized overlap reduction function for circular polarization. the generalized orfs for circular polarizations are computed by using a generalized orf for each of the four pulsars. in this section, we discuss how to separate the intensity ( @xm3 mode ) and circular polarization ( @xcite ) of the sgw by using anisotropical orfs. the parabolic potential  @xcite is the most widely used in the study of nuclear fusion. it is the only way to calculate the penetration energy of a potential barrier at energies around or above the coulomb barrier. the new formula is used to evaluate the barrier penetration of 344 nuclei with the @xmath0-nucleus potential given in eq. it is especially applicable to spherical nuclei, especially for the penetration of a parabola, where penetration energy is much lower than the barrier height.
 the schwinger model, which has been used to study quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) in two dimensions, is the most computationally demanding model of quantum field theory ( hmc ). numerical time integration schemes are often used in lattice field theory calculations. here we describe the mathematical integration schemes used for the hmc algorithm, which are based on the concept of the force gradient term @xmath, which is associated with its ( fictitious ) conjugate momenta.
 functional equations are based on algebraic relations between propagators and they are suitable for deriving functional equations for multi - loop integrals. functional equations can be obtained from algebraic relation between propagator type integrals and integrals raised to non - integer powers. in the present paper we describe the method for derivation of functional equation for the two - loop vacuum type integral, which is based on the use of algebraic relationships for propagators. in this section we will describe the methods for derivating functional equations, which can be used to derive functional equations in multi - loops integrals, and which can also be used for integration of integrals with non-integer powers.

 the sivers function is an important component of a class of single - transverse spin asymmetries that are characterized by a large momentum scale @xmath1, and by a much smaller, but also measured, transverse momentum. we have shown that the spin - dependent cross section of the sii functions for dijet - production in rhic is the same as that of the quark sivers functions for sidis, but with opposite sign. in this paper, we describe the siv functions for the dijet-production in rhinoceros, and describe their relationship to the quarks and quarks of sidis and the drell - yan process.
 the kingman s coalescent is a random tree introduced by @xcite as the genealogy arising in large population genetic models. it has infinitely many leaves and is usually constructed from leaves to the root as follows : given that there are @xmath7 lines in the tree, after some exponential time with rate @xm8, two lines are chosen uniformly and merged to one line, leaving the tree with @xxmath9 lines. we show that the probability of picking ( from the initial infinite population ) two leaves that belong to the same family is approximately @x.\end{aligned}.
 the multistep cascading is a relatively new phenomenon in optical fiber systems. it involves the simultaneous transmission of two - wave solitons in a multi - component nonlinear model. we describe the phenomenon of the long - distance propagation of _ temporal optical soliton _ in optical fibers and waveguides, and describe how it can be employed for soliton - induced waveguiding effects in multi - components nonlinear models. as a result, we describe several different physical examples of the multismep cascades associated with the multi - wave quasiperiodic soliton ( eqs ), including the one described by the css equation.
 entanglement in a composite system refers to certain implicit correlation between the subsystems arising from their interaction. entanglements in a four - particle composite system is a good measure of entangling in this case. we present a mathematical model of the entangment in a 4 - particle entangled state @xcite, which has many important implications in the subject of quantum information theory.

 background : pulsational instability in the blue supergiants ( spbsg ) is a common phenomenon and it is not yet well defined as for the range of effective temperature and luminosity. we present a comparison of the oscillation spectrum of the blue - loop models with varying degrees of instability, @xmath26, and the instability parameter, @ymath50, for models with masses of 13@xmath318 @xm91 and @xxmath31, respectively, and in the bottom - left panel of the red giant branch ( hd 163899 ). in this paper, we compare the oscillations in the pulsational unstable region of hd163899 ( top panel ) and the blue loops ( bottom panel ).
 background : the study of binary systems, whose behavior crucially depends on the underlying condition of immiscibility or miscibility @xcite, play a fundamentally important role in many areas of physics. the analysis of the dws in the case of the bec and tg components has been extended for broader settings, including the limit case corresponding to @xmath115, where the tg component is embedded into the bec background, and to bright solitons, which correspond to the bec self - repulsion coefficient @xxmath85. in the present work, we have computed the dw in the form of a cubic and quintic nonlinearity, which is the same as eq. ( [ phi1h ] ) and ( [ tg ] ), but in the opposite limit of @xmm85, which corresponds to eq.
 we use a modified flow analysis to identify inflation models where the perturbations at the end of inflation may be large enough for primordial black holes to be overproduced. we use the mukhanov variable @xcite to generate a large ensemble ( 250,000 ) of inflation models. in this large ensemble, we plot the cosmological observables for all models which are able to sustain the required number of e - foldings of inflation, @xmath8. in the remaining @xm47 of models, we compute the pbh constraints on the curvature power spectrum.
 the flight management infrastructure ( fmi ) product is intended to keep the aircraft from interfering with preplanned observations on the sky. it predicts the ground tracks necessary to execute its mission, and corrects the plan for actual conditions while airborne. to support this, the fmi product contains both a planning component that can run on the ground and in the air, and an execution component that runs in the ground. the planning component manages a set of ordered observations and optional aircraft repositioning requests.
 we have simulated 2-colour qcd, i.e. su(2 ) yang - mills theory with fermion matter fields ( ` quarks') in the fundamental representation of @xmath4, and finite lattice. we show that the diquark condensate is a non - negative determinant and pfaffian, and that it rotates from the direction of chiral symmetry breaking to that of quark - number breaking. the pion mass is a function of the gi, which is the determinant of the quark number, and thus can be used directly in our simulations.conclusionswe have shown that 2-color qcd with a finite chemical potential for quarks is a phase transition at finite quarks.
 the dipole - dipole interaction is ubiquitous in physics and for example responsible for the ever present van der waals force. it is also important for envisaged quantum computers based on atoms or ions in traps. we report on two dipole interacting d systems, which exhibit macroscopic light and dark periods, and calculate the transition rates between the two dipoles. the results of ref. in this section, we describe the effects of dipole- dipole interactions on the radiative behavior of two d systems in perturbation theory.
 the aim of this paper is to give a combinatorial description of mutation in @xmath0-cluster categories. we first describe the origin of a tilting object in @xcite, and then we describe the composition of the tilting objects in the corresponding tilting category of @xxmath9. this paper shows how mutation in the vertices of an indeterminate tilting class can be calculated by a purely combinatorsial procedure.
 the mr model has a much smaller - dimensional parameter space than the minimal supersymmetric model with a discrete @xmath3-parity ( mssm @xcite ). we have shown that this model is consistent with experiment so long as the light top squark is light enough ( and the charged higgs boson is heavy enough ). in addition, we have also shown that the mrs model is free of the superpotential and the soft supersymmetry breaking terms @xmcite and @xm2.
 the classical method of adding two integers of @xmath1-bit integers takes @xxmath2 bit operations but the classical methods of multiplying them takes at most 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10, respectively. in this paper, we discuss the possibility of applying the nikhilam sutra of vedic mathematics to binary number multiplication. we show some applications. in the first section, we present the proposed work, the multiplication algorithm and its features. in section 4, we describe background and motivation.
 we describe a van der kruit disc with the restriction that @xmath63 is a linear combination of continuous components. we show how to model the motion of the van der Kruit disc by using a set of components that depend on three exact analytic integrals and that can be used as basis functions in the two - integral approximation. in this paper, we describe the functions of the three - integral distribution functions @xm61, @xxmath65, @ymath51, @xsmath48 and @xmm59, respectively.
 the study of single - electron sources has attracted great interest due to their potential application in quantum electron optics experiments, in metrology, and in quantum information processing based on fermionic systems. we present a case of a single - particle quantum dot ( qd ) tunnel coupled to a single electronic reservoir. the relaxation rate of the qd, @xmath101, is expressed in terms of the eigenvectors of the matrix @xm61 and @xxmath110, respectively, in the time evolution of the electron - hole interaction. here we describe the relaxation rates of the quantum dot in the short - and - long - time limit ( @xmc ).
 the b z reaction is considered as a textbook example of the so - called excitable medium@xcite. it is considered to be the first example of a chemical self - organization to be demonstrated in a multilevel cellular automaton.materials and methodsthe b ion - z reaction.material and methodsthe b ion-z reaction is characterized by the presence of a large number of molecules of different sizes and shapes, which are not yet sufficient to account for all of the observed b z wave patterns.material, methods and methodssthe b ion reaction is described by the following : * proper @xmath38 ratio for a given spatial discretization at the moment of ignition.
 the uhecr energy spectrum is nearly featureless over ten orders of magnitude in energy, from @xmath0 ev to @xm1 ev, with the differential flux falling approximately as @xmm2. the uhcr energy is computed using a two - component model of uhecrs, which consists of two rings of mirrors covering from the origin of the light, @xxmath21, and @xrm25, respectively, in a time vs ( sdp ) angle plot.the results are shown in fig.
 the concept of the proper euclidean geometry is based on the riemannian geometry. it is a generalization of the classical dynamics, which does not depend on the quantum principles. in this paper, we describe the concept and introduction of the world function @xmath0, which is used to describe the structure of the physical body, and to describe its properties. this is the first step in the development of the further geometrization of physics.
 microlensing is an excellent way to search for planets, as first suggested by mao & paczynki ( 1991 ) and further developed by gould & loeb ( 1992 ). the discovery of a massive compact object ( such as a star, black hole, etc. ) in the galactic bulge, has led to the establishment of international collaborations such as mps and moa collaborations for macho 98-blg-35, which obtain sub - day to sub - hourly photometry on events discovered by the survey teams macho, ogle and eros.
 the value of the circular orbital velocity at the sun s radius in the milky way is of considerable interest in galactic and extragalactic astrophysics. we present a new population of maser kinematics associated with the Milky Way. this population of masers is based on the maser data, and is based upon the data obtained from r09, which is a very long baseline array ( vlba ) and is used to model the dynamics of the galaxy.
 the @xmath4-channel resonance is formed by a single partial wave matching to spin and parity of the resonance. it is the first time that the analyzing power of the @xcite has been used in the analysis of the data in a complete way. the results of this experiment show that the analysis power is smallest at the lowest energy of the magnetic field in the magnetic resonance region, but with a significant effect on the analysis capacity of the analyzing powers in the resonance region.
 background : the luminosity function of the globular clusters is a relatively well - defined parameter in the photometry of these clusters. we report a small improvement in the quality and quantity of data on the low mass end of the stellar initial mass function ( lf ) from observations of globular cluster luminosity functions ( ngc 2420 and ngc2477 ), and we show that the lf of ngc 2320 is significantly higher than that of the open cluster lfs ( holtzman _ et al. _ ( 1995b ), but this is not the case for the open clusters, which are the subject of this paper.
 the miri medium resolution spectrometer ( mrs ) is an integral field unit ( ifu ) that is a wide array of mirrors with a wide beam waist. the mrs is a highly efficient spectrometric instrument that can be used in the infrared and at cryogenic temperatures, and hence is well suited for use in the spectroscopic field of view.materials and methodsthe mrs consists of four spectrometers, each with its own ifu @xcite, which is mounted on a single wheel and is used to divide the spectral band between the two focal plane arrays. in the beam waist, the laser beam waist is offset to the width of the slit.
 jastrow basis functions are a generalization of gutzwiller s approach @xcite in which a nonlinear function is used to count and control the electron count on a single atom. however, they are not well suited for stenciling in strongly correlated regimes, where the best current option is to rely on a factorial - cost determinantal expansion. in this paper, we discuss the feasibility of jastrows of the type given in eq, which are compatible with the variational monte carlo approach, and how to use them in a general - purpose stencils.
 we propose a method to extract unknown coupling parameters introduced for the case of one parameter in the @xmath18, which has since been used for various reactions. we describe a method that can be used to extract the unknown couplings from their measured mean values and to compare them with their form in the standard model. in this paper, we describe the method of optimal observables, which is based on the linearisation of the couplings, and the analysis of the results of the analysis.
 we present 4d gauge theories that describe physics on 5d curved geometries. we first describe a 4d model with the gravitationally symmetric form @xmath18, which is a hypermultiplet of the massless vector field @xxmath72, which has a mass of 0.5d, and which is localized at the gv\bar c'_{i+1} dimensions. in this paper, we discuss the localization behavior of the graviton mass, the spinor mass, and the mass of the vector fields @xm87, which are localized along the warped background. in the next section, we describe a 5d model of graviton masses, which have a mass, spinor, and scalar mass, respectively.
 the study of the formation and evolution of galaxies is one of the most important issues of present - day astronomy. the currently favoured models suggest that large galaxies such as the milky way formed through the hierarchical accretion of a number of smaller objects. our simulations suggest that the formation of very metal poor stars is due to a dearth of very heavy stars ( vmpss ), and that the mass of the star is still active, even if only for stars with @xmath0}\leq-3 $ ]. in order to investigate whether this dearth is consistent with the simple hypothesis that the gas in the sculptor dsph ( hereafter, scl ) was completely self - enriched in metals, the simulations were aimed at reproducing the chemical properties of the sculptureor dsm ( hereafter, scl ). we used numerical simulations of chemical enrichment of dwarf galaxies to investigate, for the first time, the metallicity distribution of stars in the simulated galaxy.
 the dynamical density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) @xcite is the most widely used deconvolution method for one - dimensional systems and quantum impurity problems. it is a simple and well - defined deconvolved spectrum of a finite - system spectrum with a narrow lorentzian broadening @xmath146. we have used the deconvolve method to obtain the piecewise smooth spectrum of an infinite system spectrum from a broadened finite system spectrum. the deconvection of the ddmrg spectrum has been performed using a minimization of the cost function @xmrg.
 the concept of balance in the non - hermitian quantum mechanics has been well developed as the complex extension of conventional quantum mechanics. we investigate the role of the quantum mechanics in the construction of a semi - infinite non-Hermitian system without @xmath3 symmetry breaking. in this paper, we describe a non - Hermitian model with a unique dynamic spectrum and study the dynamics of the wave functions in the system. the results of this study are summarized in figs.
 the vft thermal activation law is a central experimental law which controls the rate of transition in bulk polymer systems@xcite. it is the first experimental law to be derived from the empirical vft law of transition rates. the empirical principle of the vFT thermal activation laws is that @xmath18 per link determining the chain mobility also determines the dynamical glass transition temperature in the empirical Vft law. we have the empirical proof that the closed chain activation law has a vft form given by eq.
 we present a theoretical investigation of polarization squeezing generated by an ensemble of x - like 4-level atoms in an optical cavity driven by a linearly polarized field @xcite. we show that self - rotation is responsible for polarization switching and saturation leads to tristability in the optical pumping regime. in this section, we describe the dynamics of the optical pump and the effects of the kerr effect on the absorption and dispersion of the field. the results are summarized in fig [ fig3 ].
 the rank - three tensor model is a theory of dynamical commutative nonassociative fuzzy spaces. it is based on the fact that the generalized generalized generalized quantum gravity ( generalized matrix model ) is a successful tool to analyze the two - dimensional simplicial gravity, but it has not been successful in this direction, partly because of the absence of analytical methods to solve it and of physically appropriate interpretations of its partition function. this paper gives a summary of the results obtained so far concerning the emergence of the general relativity in the tensor models.
 the mystery of the dark energy / cosmological constant persists despite great efforts of particle physicists and cosmologists to find a convincing solution. since the famous article by s. weinberg on the cosmology of dark energy, it is well known that candidate models should not only explain the smallness of the cosmic constant, if it is somehow related to quantum gravity, but also what is called the coincidence problem i.e. why does dark energy become dominant quite late in the history of the universe? here we suggest an alternative to a primordial quintessence field. we summarize our preliminary results in two following figures.the first figure shows @xmath9 of the fit of quintessences models on the publicly available super - novae ia data.
 the @xmath2 limit of qcd is the most general potential that describes the dynamics of the heavy meson - heavy antimeson pair. we have used the @xcite to obtain a molecular scheme based on several qcd symmetries in the @Xmath17 limit of the qcd, which is the lowest energy constants or counter - terms ( lecs ), up to corrections of the order @xm5, and by the nsfc ( grant no. 11165005 ) to obtain the potentials in every possible channel.
 we present a new photometry technique for precise time - series photometry of non - crowded fields with a highly varying psf. the photometry is based on the concentric aperture photometry algorithm in daophot package @xcite, which is optimized for wide - field time domain astronomy.materials and methodsthe photometry used for this study was performed with the multichannel image collection of the open cluster m37 ( mmt / megacam).resultswe obtained a total of 23,790 data points from the m37, including a total number of 30,294 images, which were analyzed using the glacial - scale photometry method. in addition, we computed the rms photometric precision of the re - calibrated light curves ( @xmath34-axis ) using the sigma - clipping method.resultswe found that the photometric accuracy was superior to that of the raw data, with the exception of a small fraction of the observed data points.
 factorization of numbers into their prime factors is a hard non - polynomial problem for classical computers. the gauss sums can be used successfully to factorize numbers on a quantum computer with a tremendous speedup as compared to a classical computer. in the present paper, we investigate how truncated fourier sum and its generalizations, like truncated gauss, kummer and exponential sums, could emerge from superposition of several oscillations. in this paper, we describe how the truncated fourier sum can be applied to factorizing numbers based on multiple oscillations, including the linear phase @xmath44, and the quadratic phase @xcite.
 we show that a computable learning algorithm can be efficient in the sense of running in polynomial time of certain parameters @xmath74. this paper shows that a single learning algorithm, with a finite number of samples, can be used to evaluate all computable classifiers in a finite vc - dimension, and obtain an algorithm with asymptotically optimal computation time.conclusionsconventional statistical learning theory attempts to bound the number of sample complexity to a specified level of accuracy for each of the above models ( e.g. neural networks, support vector machines ). here, we show the absence of distribution independent bounds on sample complexity for computable universal learning algorithms.
 we describe the effect of electroweak sudakov corrections on the longitudinal gauge boson scattering amplitude. the results of this study are that the electroweak logarithms are used to calculate the unitarity bound of the electrostatic coupling of longitudinal gauge and higgs bosons. we also describe the effects of electrostatic corrections on unitarity at tree level, using the equivalence theorem@xcite@xmath13@xm, which is a simple exercise for 2 by 2 matrices.
 the gaseous component of protoplanetary disks is crucial for understanding the planet formation process because it affects the structures and evolution of the disk via chemical reactions. we present the results of [ c i ] @xmath1@xmath2 ( 492.161 ghz ) and co ( 461.041 ghz) observations toward three classical t tauri stars ( ttss ), l1551 irs 5 and hl tau, and, in november 2010 using the atacama submillimeter telescope experiment.
 molecular discreteness is a phenomenon that occurs when the concentration of a certain chemical species is small. we investigate the effects of the discreteeness on the behavior of the system with a small number of molecules. in this case, we consider the case where @xmath13 is species - dependent and the inflow of the chemical is species dependent. in the 2 - 4 rich state, the system is dominated by diffusion, and the outflow of the molecules is species-dependent. in addition, we observe that the rate of the reaction, which is dependent on @xxmath18, is larger than that of the rate equation of the reactant.
 white dwarfs are the end points of all low- to intermediate - mass stars, which are the majority of stars in the universe. they are dense stellar remnants composed of electron degenerate cores surrounded by non - degenerate envelopes. we report on the discovery of 42 pulsating white dwarf candidates in the original field of the _ kepler _ mission, and how they have evolved into zzceti stars, including the variable da white dwarf ( davs ), which have been or will be observed in the future.
 the substellar initial mass function ( imf ) is a complex and complex process. it is difficult to compare directly with the observed mass function of stars and substellar objects. in this paper, we describe the data, illustrate that there is no strong evidence for variation in the imf between the star - forming regions, and outline our approach to constrain the low - mass imf. in a pioneering work, we used a mass function built using the @xcite database. the ratio of stars to brown dwarfs was calculated by using the binomial tail product.
 the study of spin dependent transport in low - dimensional systems has been largely dominated in the last few decades due to the rapid advancement in nano - scale science and technology @xcite. the present work presents a general theory for calculating spin polarization coefficient @xmath0 in two output leads based on green s function formalism. we describe the curvature effect on spin polarization in a three - terminal bridge setup using a tight - binding ( tb ) framework and based on red s functions formalism. in this paper we describe two simple geometries : a simple linear conductor and a ring - like geometry.
