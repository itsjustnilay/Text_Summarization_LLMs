{"lay_summary": "Messenger RNAs carry the instructions necessary to synthesize proteins that do work for the cell .

A key question in the field is how DNA sequence variants impact gene expression , with most mechanistic studies to date focused on the effects of genetic change on regulatory regions upstream of protein-coding sequence . By contrast , the role of RNA 3\u2032-end processing in regulatory variation remains largely unknown , owing in part to the challenge of identifying functional elements in 3\u2032 untranslated regions . In this work , we conducted a genomic survey of transcript ends in lymphoblastoid cells from genetically distinct human individuals . Our analysis mapped the cis-regulatory architecture of 3\u2032 gene ends , finding that transcript end positions did not fall randomly in untranslated regions , but rather preferentially flanked the locations of 3\u2032 regulatory elements , including miRNA sites . The usage of these transcript length forms and motifs varied across human individuals , and polymorphisms in polyadenylation signals and other 3\u2032 motifs were significant predictors of expression levels of the genes in which they lay . Independent single-gene experiments confirmed the effects of polyadenylation variants on steady-state expression of their respective genes , and validated the regulatory function of 3\u2032 cis-regulatory sequence elements that mediated expression of these distinct RNA length forms . Focusing on the immune regulator IRF5 , we established the effect of natural variation in RNA 3\u2032-end processing on regulatory response to antigen stimulation . Our results underscore the importance of two mechanisms at play in the genetics of 3\u2032-end variation: the usage of distinct 3\u2032-end processing signals and the effects of 3\u2032 sequence elements that determine transcript fate . Our findings suggest that the strategy of integrating observed 3\u2032-end positions with inferred 3\u2032 regulatory motifs will prove to be a critical tool in continued efforts to interpret human genome variation . \n Naturally occurring genetic differences in gene regulation within populations underlie phenotypes of evolutionary and biomedical interest [1]\u2013[3] and can serve as the basis for inference of regulatory networks [4] , [5] . A key problem in the field is understanding the molecular mechanisms by which DNA sequence variants give rise to expression change . Recent work has emphasized the importance of sequence differences in regions upstream of gene loci that harbor cis-acting determinants of transcription factor binding [6]\u2013[10] and chromatin architecture [11]\u2013[13] . Much less is known about the role of 3\u2032-end regulation as a determinant of expression variation between individuals . Alternative polyadenylation represents a major regulatory strategy in the human genome , with analysis across tissue types detecting multiple 3\u2032 UTR forms of over half of all human genes [14] . Detailed genetic studies have implicated polymorphisms affecting transcript termination in both Mendelian and complex human disease [15]\u2013[20] . Genomic analyses have hinted at a broader role for genetic differences in RNA 3\u2032-end processing as a driver of expression variation [6] , [8] , [21] , [22] , but the prevalence and the mechanisms of these changes are incompletely understood . Progress in dissecting the genetics of 3\u2032-end processing has been limited in part by fundamental questions about the regulatory information encoded in 3\u2032 UTRs . Single-gene studies have made clear that , in addition to its interplay with exonic splicing [23] , [24] , RNA 3\u2032-end processing can dictate the extent of 3\u2032 UTR sequence incorporated into mature transcripts that governs half-life , translation , and localization [25]\u2013[29]; the efficiency of transcription termination itself can also influence steady-state expression level of a given length form [30]\u2013[34] . In general , however , identifying the regulatory elements that underlie relationships between 3\u2032 UTR sequence and gene expression remains a primary challenge , and for the majority of human genes , the regulatory impact of alternative polyadenylation is unknown . Likewise , the search for molecular players underlying cis-regulation of 3\u2032-end processing at individual gene loci [23] and genome-scale regulation of 3\u2032-end processing in trans [14] , [29] , [35]\u2013[40] is an area of active research . A complete understanding of the genetics of alternative polyadenylation will require maps of transcript end site usage and 3\u2032 cis-regulatory elements , and analysis strategies to integrate the data . Recently developed short-read sequencing methods for transcript ends [40]\u2013[46] have enabled the possibility of quantitative studies of the regulatory architecture of transcript end forms on a genomic scale . In this work , we set out to investigate mechanisms by which alternative polyadenylation impacts gene expression and its variation across genetically distinct human individuals . We used 3\u2032-end RNA-seq [42] to maximize the genomic coverage and precision of transcript end positions , and to measure quantitative expression levels of transcript forms . The results shed light on the architecture of transcript ends and regulatory elements in human 3\u2032 UTRs and the principles of genetic variation in 3\u2032 length form usage . \n To survey the 3\u2032 ends of transcripts in human B-lymphoblastoid cells , we isolated RNA from cell lines derived from six human individuals and subjected each replicate of each sample to 3\u2032-end RNA-seq , which sequences polyadenylated transcript ends on a genomic scale [42] with strong and significant reproducibility ( Figure S1 ) . Our analysis pipeline , described in Materials and Methods , filtered out likely products of mispriming from A-rich genomic regions [47] and categorized mapping reads in terms of well-defined peaks or dispersed regions of reads with no peak structure ( Table S1 ) . We considered the former to represent the strongest candidates for stable , functional transcript end forms , and focused on these for in-depth analysis , taking the last mapped base of each read as the likely site at which the nascent RNA was cleaved from the processing polymerase and polyadenylated [24] . Across such transcript ends mapping to nuclear-encoded loci , the vast majority of reads ( 87% ) originated from 3\u2032 UTRs of coding genes ( Figure 1A and Table S1 ) ; 80% of transcript ends were consistent with the 3\u2032 ends of previously annotated length forms ( Tables S1 and S2 and Figure S2 ) . Within 40 base pairs of the inferred cleavage position , most transcript end forms harbored a polyadenylation signal sequence: either the canonical A ( A/U ) UAAA [23] or a close variant , or an A-rich stretch [48]\u2013[50] ( Figure S3A ) . Reporter assays confirmed the regulatory importance of A-rich stretches upstream of the inferred cleavage positions in CPSF1 and WDR18 , whose 3\u2032 UTRs lacked canonical polyadenylation signal motifs ( Figure S3C ) . We set out to analyze our data set of 3\u2032 transcript ends with respect to alternative polyadenylation , focusing on a maximum of two abundant , distinguishable transcript forms in a given gene . We considered three patterns of transcript end usage [30]: class I , indicating genes with a single transcript form terminating in an annotated 3\u2032 UTR; class II , genes with alternative polyadenylation in the same annotated 3\u2032 UTR; and class III , genes in which the two alternative polyadenylation forms differed in their composition of coding sequence ( Figure 1B ) . We also observed a small fraction of genes with a single transcript form terminating inside annotated coding exons or introns ( Table S3 ) . The breakdown of transcript forms into these classes revealed alternative polyadenylation reaching our threshold of detection in \u223c30% of genes ( Figure 1B ) . Across these genes , we observed the expected enrichment of the A ( A/U ) UAAA polyadenylation signal motif in the distal relative to proximal polyadenylation signals ( Figure S3A ) , correlating with the higher expression levels of the long transcript forms [30] , [51] . The lower-abundance short transcript forms were more likely to harbor an A-rich stretch or no recognizable polyadenylation signal motif upstream of the inferred cleavage position ( Figure S3B ) , lending credence to the notion that the latter regions represent weak recognition sites for the 3\u2032-end processing machinery [48] . We sought to harness our data set of transcript ends to investigate regulatory elements governing translation and transcript half-life , and their relationship to alternative 3\u2032 transcript forms . For this purpose , we applied a motif-search strategy to identify putative microRNA binding sites , A/U rich elements ( AREs ) , G/U-rich elements , binding sites for the Pumilio family of proteins , and Alu transposable elements in 3\u2032 UTRs . We tabulated rates of sequence variation across human populations and observed marked conservation of most regulatory element motifs relative to the background level of 3\u2032 UTR polymorphism ( Figure 2A ) , reflecting a history of purifying selection on these putatively functional regulatory sequences [52]\u2013[54] . We expected that the regulatory logic of alternative polyadenylation would be intimately connected with sequence determinants of transcript half-life or translation in 3\u2032 UTRs . For a given gene subject to alternative polyadenylation , we referred to the region of the 3\u2032 UTR upstream of the proximal cleavage site as \u201cshared\u201d among the alternative polyadenylation length forms , and the span of the 3\u2032 UTR in between the proximal and distal cleavage sites as the \u201cdifferential\u201d region ( Figure 2B ) . We hypothesized that , if alternative polyadenylation often acted to tune the exposure of cis-regulatory motifs in 3\u2032 UTR sequences , these motifs would preferentially be positioned in differential regions . To test this , we tabulated the positions of each type of regulatory element across our set of alternatively polyadenylated genes in class II . Significance testing revealed a significant enrichment of genes with motifs in the differential regions of 3\u2032 UTRs relative to those with motifs in shared regions ( Figure 2C ) . Analyzing the annotations of genes in these sets , we observed a preponderance of genes with immune-related functions among those with cis-regulatory motifs in the differential regions of 3\u2032 UTRs , while motifs in shared regions of 3\u2032 UTRs were largely detected among genes with housekeeping roles ( Table S5 ) . Thus , for genes carrying out immune processes in B-lymphoblastoid cells , the choice between long and short transcript end forms often exposes or eliminates regulatory information in 3\u2032 UTRs , highlighting the importance of 3\u2032-end processing in the control of gene expression levels for specialized cell functions . To investigate the genetics of RNA 3\u2032-end processing , we first assessed the contribution of genetic differences , relative to experimental and environmental error , to variation of transcript 3\u2032-end positions across the six genotypes of lymphoblastoid cells in our study . For this purpose , we calculated the heritability of length form abundance for each gene , finding 194 coding genes at which the abundances of transcript length forms differed reproducibly ( heritability>0 . 6 ) across human samples ( Table S6 ) . To begin to dissect the molecular basis for natural genetic variation in 3\u2032-end usage at these loci , we considered the potential role for DNA sequence differences at polyadenylation signals , the primary determinants of transcript cleavage and polyadenylation . We reasoned that although such variants were rare in the human population ( Figure 2A ) , some could underlie differences between human individuals in 3\u2032-end length form usage . Consistent with this prediction , genes with highly heritable transcript end positions harbored a single nucleotide polymorphism in polyadenylation signal motif sequence much more often than did the average gene ( 2% of polyadenylation signals at genes with heritable transcript ends , compared to 0 . 3% genome-wide; Fisher's exact p\u200a=\u200a0 . 004; Table S6 ) . We hypothesized that naturally occurring genetic variation in RNA 3\u2032-end processing would prove to underlie changes across individuals in steady-state levels of gene expression . To test this , we analyzed the genomic relationship between biallelic single-nucleotide polymorphisms in polyadenylation signals and gene expression differences across our set of lymphoblastoid cell lines from distinct human genotypes . We used a standard regression test of genetic association to evaluate genotype at each such sequence variant as a predictor of expression of the gene in which it lay . The results revealed a significant enrichment of association with expression for variants in polyadenylation signals , relative to the background signal from 3\u2032 UTRs as a whole ( Figure 3A ) . We expected that for a given such variant , the allele conferring a closer match to the canonical polyadenylation signal motif would confer more robust transcription termination , and thus more abundant steady-state levels of transcription , than would the allele weakening the match to the canonical motif . To quantify this effect , we scored each allele in each variant polyadenylation signal with respect to agreement with the canonical motif , and at each variant position , we calculated the difference in scores between alleles . This score difference was a strong predictor of the effect of a given polyadenylation signal variant on steady-state expression levels ( Figure 3B ) , with a departure from the polyadenylation signal motif associated with a drop in expression as predicted . To pursue on a molecular basis the impact of variation across humans in polyadenylation signals , we used our 3\u2032-end RNA-seq data to infer the effects of single-nucleotide variants on usage of 3\u2032 transcript forms at individual genes , and we evaluated these predictions in single-gene 3\u2032 UTR reporter assays . For each gene , toggling natural variant alleles at one nucleotide position in the polyadenylation signal was sufficient to drive differential usage of short and long 3\u2032 transcript forms ( Figure 4 ) . These included variants attenuating usage of 3\u2032 forms of the translation initiation factor EIF2A and the putative DNA methylation enzyme DIP2B , as well as the expected effect of the polymorphic polyadenylation signal on usage of 3\u2032 forms of the inflammation regulator IRF5 [15] . In each of the latter genes , the causal variant conferred significant changes in luciferase protein levels as well as usage of transcript forms ( Figure 4A\u2013F ) . Our set of confirmed causal variants at polyadenylation signals also included that in the transcription factor NAB1 , which attenuated usage of a minor 3\u2032 transcript form with modest effect on luciferase levels ( Figure 4G , H ) . We conclude that sequence differences in polyadenylation signals represent a key mechanism underlying variation between humans in levels of gene expression , with genome-scale trends validated at the single-gene level . We next sought to dissect the mechanisms by which natural variation in 3\u2032-end usage impacted gene expression , using as case studies IRF5 and DIP2B , which lie in genomic regions associated with susceptibility to lupus [15] and colorectal cancer [55] , respectively , as well as NAB1 and EIF2A . In RNA expression measurements using the 3\u2032 UTR haplotype that produced both long and short transcript forms of a given gene , one form was detected at higher abundance in each case ( Figure 4B , D , F , H ) . We hypothesized that these abundance differences between length forms could be in part the result of sequence elements that dictate transcript cleavage , polyadenylation , and termination , and in part the result of regulatory elements that affect transcript half-life . To test this , for each gene we first developed expression reporters incorporating only the regions flanking the end positions of each transcript form in turn , which we expected would include the polyadenylation signal and auxiliary sequence motifs underlying 3\u2032-end processing of the respective form while excluding most other 3\u2032 regulatory information . Expression measurements confirmed differences in the strength of these 3\u2032-end processing motifs between length forms for EIF2A , IRF5 , and DIP2B , in that reporters incorporating each of the two 3\u2032-end sequences from a given gene exhibited up to 2 . 5-fold differences in expression ( Figure 5A , C , E ) . To assess the contribution of 3\u2032 regulatory elements that control transcript half-life , we next measured the decay rate of each transcript length form upon addition of actinomycin D in the context of complete 3\u2032 UTRs . Measurements of transcript stability by quantitative PCR and by Northern blot bore out this prediction , with the long transcript form showing reduced half-life relative to the short form for IRF5 [15] and DIP2B ( Figure 5D , F and Figure S4B , C ) , and increased half-life for NAB1 ( Figure 5H and Figure S4D ) . Analyzing these results together with the effects of natural variants in polyadenylation signals ( Figure 4 ) indicates that for a given gene , a variant can abrogate production of a transcript form with strong sequence determinants of 3\u2032-end processing , leaving only the less efficiently processed form and giving rise to lower total expression of the gene product , as in IRF5 and EIF2A . In addition , a variant abrogating production of a transcript form with longer half-life leaves only the less-stable form and reduces total steady-state levels of the gene product , as in IRF5 and DIP2B . As a further investigation of the determinants of abundance of long and short transcript forms for genes subject to natural genetic change in 3\u2032-end processing , we analyzed the role of 3\u2032 regulatory elements in such genes in relation to trans-acting regulatory factors . We identified a candidate ARE in the differential region of the 3\u2032 UTR of IRF5 , i . e . between the positions of alternative 3\u2032 ends observed in our 3\u2032-end RNA-seq; a candidate ARE in the differential region of NAB1; and a candidate binding site for the miRNA miR-101 in the differential region of DIP2B ( Figure 6 ) . To assess the functional relevance of these motifs , we applied a mutagenesis strategy using 3\u2032 UTR reporter constructs for each gene , as above distinguishing between the 3\u2032 UTR haplotype that produced both long and short transcript forms and the haplotype producing only the long form ( Figure 4D , F , H ) . For each inferred cis-regulatory element , we assayed the regulatory response of 3\u2032 UTR reporters to the trans-acting factor predicted to mediate its repressive effect: the ARE-binding proteins TTP and AUF1 for IRF5 and NAB1 , respectively , and a mimic of miR-101 for DIP2B . In each case , expression measurements from mutagenized reporter constructs established the respective sequence element as necessary for full repression of the long form of its host UTR ( Figure 6 ) , validating our motif inferences . Among experiments that used haplotypes producing both short and long 3\u2032 forms of the respective UTRs , motifs in the differential region were only necessary for repression by trans-acting factors in the case of NAB1 ( Figure 6C ) , for which the population of transcripts arising from this haplotype was dominated by the long form ( Figure 4H ) . Taken together , our results illustrate the complexity of regulatory information in 3\u2032 UTRs , as determinants of RNA 3\u2032-end processing and transcript fate each contribute to the final expression level of the host gene . We conclude that , for these case studies , integrating predicted regulatory motifs with knowledge of transcript end positions is essential in the effort to relate genotype to gene expression . We next aimed to shed light on the biological context in which differences in regulatory responsiveness could manifest between long and short transcript forms . For this purpose , we focused on natural variation in alternative polyadenylation at the immune regulator IRF5 . In response to the bacterial cell wall component lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) , immune genes undergo an immediate spike in expression , followed by dampening to a more modest steady-state level mediated by the ARE-binding protein TTP [56]\u2013[58] . Motivated by our discovery of a repressive ARE in the differential region of IRF5 ( Figure 6A ) , we hypothesized that the genetically determined production of long and short 3\u2032 mRNA forms of this gene would be associated with different patterns of regulatory behavior after induction . To test this , we treated B-lymphoblastoid cell lines from genetically distinct individuals with LPS and , in each culture , measured the recovery of expression levels of IRF5 transcript forms over time . The results , shown in Figure 7 , revealed , after an initial overshoot in expression , a difference of up to 2-fold in the time to reach steady-state expression between long and short mRNA forms , with the long form downregulated to steady-state more quickly after induction as predicted , given the presence of the repressive ARE in the latter transcript . Variation in IRF5 expression recovery across B-lymphoblastoid lines was associated with genotype at the proximal polyadenylation signal in the IRF5 3\u2032 UTR: haplotypes encoding the long form of IRF5 conferred rapid repression after induction ( Figure 7B ) relative to haplotypes encoding the short form ( Figure 7A ) . These findings suggest that genetic variation in 3\u2032-end processing dictates differences across individuals in the regulatory dynamics of IRF5 , further underscoring the power of our approach to identify biologically relevant regulatory effects of 3\u2032-end processing . Our molecular confirmation of cis-regulatory elements in 3\u2032 UTRs inferred from sequence search methods ( Figure 6 ) suggested that such inference could provide a mechanistic understanding of gene expression on a genomic scale . In particular , we expected that sequence variants between individuals in 3\u2032 regulatory elements would be significant predictors of variation in steady-state expression of the genes in which they lay . To test this notion , we first tabulated all single-nucleotide polymorphisms across the cell lines of our data set which overlapped with 3\u2032 regulatory motifs and Alu elements in 3\u2032 UTRs . We next classified these motifs according to the impact of alternative polyadenylation on their positions in 3\u2032 UTRs , and we used association tests to assess the strength of each motif variant in each class as a predictor of steady-state expression of its respective gene . The results ( Figure 8 ) revealed association with expression across human individuals , for variants in AREs , G/U-rich elements , Pumilio sites , and Alu elements . The relationship with expression was striking and significant for variants in regions of 3\u2032 UTRs constitutively incorporated into mature messages ( Figure 8 ) . Polymorphic motifs incorporated into low-abundance 3\u2032 length forms showed no evidence of association with expression changes in their respective genes , consistent with the minor contribution of these forms; by the same token , polymorphic motifs in regions incorporated into the predominant 3\u2032 length forms of mRNAs were more strongly associated with expression of their respective genes , though not significantly so ( Figure 8 ) . As expected [6] , the relationship between sequence variants and gene expression did not manifest for miRNA sites ( data not shown ) . These findings highlight the relevance of 3\u2032 regulatory motifs as predictors of expression variation across human individuals , when integrated with knowledge of transcript length forms from our sequencing strategy . \n Alternative polyadenylation is prevalent in the human transcriptome , and in landmark cases , variation across individuals in the use of 3\u2032 length forms of RNAs has been shown to underlie human disease [15]\u2013[20] . However , for most human genes , the regulatory importance of changes in transcript ends between individuals is incompletely understood , owing to the challenges of measuring 3\u2032-end usage and identifying functional regulatory elements in 3\u2032 UTRs . We have developed a spatially precise , quantitative , high-throughput sequencing approach for 3\u2032 ends , complementing now-classic studies of expressed sequence tags [30] , [36] , [48] , [51] , [59]\u2013[61] . We have used the resulting transcript end positions and abundances to pioneer an analysis approach which integrates bioinformatic predictions of 3\u2032 regulatory motifs , genomic analysis , and molecular genetics . With this strategy , we have established a regulatory map of transcript ends and functional elements in the 3\u2032 UTRs of lymphoblastoid cells , and we have abstracted genomic principles of alternative polyadenylation and natural genetic variation in this cell type . Our mapping of 3\u2032-end length forms and sequence motifs in 3\u2032 UTRs revealed an intuitive logic in which the choice between short and long UTR forms governs the incorporation of regulatory elements into mature messages [36] , [61] . We note that the 3\u2032 length forms we report in B-lymphoblastoid cells represent a subset of the total complement of 3\u2032 UTR lengths used across tissues . As such , we hypothesize that surveys of tissue types will ultimately reveal transcript forms of many genes , used in particular contexts , that incorporate 3\u2032 regulatory information to different extents . The ability to tune the responsiveness to trans-acting input itself distinguishes alternative polyadenylation from other transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms , providing a compelling model for the particular advantage of 3\u2032-end processing as a regulatory strategy and a rationale for its prevalence in mammalian genomes . In comparisons across cell lines from genetically distinct individuals , we analyzed the regulatory importance of genetic changes at 3\u2032 transcript ends . We uncovered a key role for polymorphisms in polyadenylation signals as a driver of changes in gene expression , and we detailed the molecular mechanisms at play . The polyadenylation variants we study here dictate the production of transcript forms with different determinants of 3\u2032-end processing , different half-lives , and different recognition sites for trans-acting regulators . These findings establish a connection between observational studies of transcript 3\u2032 length forms across human populations [21] , [22] and regulatory effects of this variation . In the case of IRF5 , we discovered that a naturally occurring genetic change in usage of 3\u2032 RNA forms can serve to tune the kinetics of recovery of expression after induction by lipopolysaccharide . Thus , against the backdrop of prior studies of this lupus susceptibility gene [15] , we have uncovered an additional dimension by which variation in RNA 3\u2032-end processing affects regulatory behavior . Given these case-study results as a validation of our genome-scale analyses , we speculate that many genetic variants with biologically relevant effects mediated by RNA 3\u2032-end processing remain to be discovered in the human population . We have also shown that polymorphisms in 3\u2032 motifs that govern transcript fate can serve as predictors of steady-state levels of the genes in which they lie . In light of the ultimate goal of predicting regulatory and phenotypic effects from human genome sequence , our results indicate that analysis strategies using sequence determinants of transcription initiation and splicing alone are likely to provide an incomplete model of expression variation . Importantly , however , our work makes clear that binding sites for regulators of mRNA localization , half-life , and translation at 3\u2032 ends are themselves only part of the regulatory landscape . Rather , a complete understanding of the genetics of gene expression will integrate the usage of RNA 3\u2032-end processing signals with the effects of 3\u2032 sequence elements that control transcript fate . We anticipate that abundances and positions of transcript ends observed in 3\u2032-end RNA-seq will prove to be a key component in the systems-level modeling of regulatory networks and their variation . In summary , while the genetic study of RNA 3\u2032-end processing is in its infancy , our work and that of others [15]\u2013[22] establishes that variation at 3\u2032 ends can be a critical determinant of regulatory behaviors . However , for the vast majority of human genes , the importance of 3\u2032 regulatory change remains unknown . Our single-gene experiments detail the expression effects of 3\u2032 UTR variation in the disease-associated genes IRF5 [15] and DIP2B [55]; the potential for regulatory variants as drivers of human disease will serve as continued motivation for genomic and genetic analyses of expression change . \n Two biological replicates of each of the human lymphoblastoid cell lines GM10860 , GM17106 , GM17189 , GM17207 , GM17220 , and GM17253 ( Coriell Institute ) were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamate and 15% fetal bovine serum . Cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C under 5% carbon dioxide . Total RNA was extracted from \u223c107 cells using TRIzol reagent ( Invitrogen ) , and genomic DNA was removed from RNA using Turbo DNase ( Ambion ) . Polyadenylated RNA was selected from 10 \u00b5g of total RNA using the Dynabeads mRNA purification kit ( Invitrogen ) , and was fragmented for 3 minutes at 70\u00b0C using 10\u00d7 Fragmentation Reagent ( Ambion ) . After ethanol precipitation , polyadenylated RNA fragments were selected using the Dynabeads mRNA purification kit and reverse transcribed using SuperScript II ( Invitrogen ) and anchored oligo-dT ( Invitrogen ) . Double-stranded cDNA was generated using RNase H ( Invitrogen ) and DNA Pol I ( Invitrogen ) , end-repaired using T4 DNA Polymerase ( New England Biolabs ) , Klenow DNA Polymerase ( New England Biolabs ) , and T4 PNK ( New England Biolabs ) , and then adenylated using Klenow 3\u2032 to 5\u2032 exo minus ( New England Biolabs ) . Illumina paired-end adapters were ligated to the adenylated cDNA using T4 DNA Ligase ( Enzymatics ) . Ligated cDNA was purified on a 2% agarose gel and then amplified by performing 12 cycles of PCR using Phusion HF Polymerase ( New England Biolabs ) . Libraries were sequenced using 40 bp paired-end modules on an Illumina 2G Genome Analyzer . Consecutive T's from the beginning of all reads were trimmed and classified before mapping: for a given read , if there were more than 20 consecutive T's or if neither mate of a read pair had a stretch of T's , the read was not included in further analysis . For mapping , the set of single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) segregating in the CEU population was downloaded from HapMap phase II+III , release 27 ( ftp://ftp . ncbi . nlm . nih . gov/hapmap/genotypes ) , and used to modify the human reference genome ( hg18; [62] ) by incorporating the appropriate ambiguous bases at each SNP position . All reads were then mapped to this modified genome and to the associated splicing junctions in the Known Genes database of the UCSC genome browser [63] using MOSAIK ( http://bioinformatics . bc . edu/marthlab/Software_Release ) . For a given length of trimmed T's , nT , a splicing junction reference was created by concatenating 37 - nT bp from each exon adjacent to the splicing junction to ensure that the reads mapped across the splicing junction . If the reads mapped to both the genome and a splicing junction , the mapping with smaller number of mismatches was used . Only uniquely mapped reads with two or fewer mismatches in each mate were retained . Trimmed T's were then compared to the genome sequence; reads with >2 mismatches to the genome in this poly-T tract were retained for analysis . We inferred that a given read was transcribed from the minus strand of the genome if , when it was mapped to the reference genome , the position of its poly-T tract had a lower coordinate position than the mapped position of the other end of the read; we inferred that a read was transcribed from the plus strand of the genome if the mapped position of its poly-T tract had a higher coordinate position than the position of the other end . Mapped reads yielded an average coverage of 22 . 6% of UCSC annotated 3\u2032 UTRs with a depth of 97 . 8 reads/bp for the covered bases for each sample . The last 100 bp of annotated 3\u2032 UTRs were even more highly represented in libraries , with an average coverage of 43 . 4% and an average depth of 211 . 1 reads/bp . Mapped reads from all samples were pooled , sorted according to the polyA positions , defined as the coordinate of the base adjacent to the polyA tail , and then grouped into tag clusters as follows . For each strand of each chromosome , the 5\u2032 boundary of a tag cluster was set as the polyA position of the first read , and then reads were sequentially added to this unit until the polyA position of the next read was more than 15 bp away . The latter position then became the 5\u2032 boundary of the next tag cluster . Most tag clusters spanned less than 24 bp , but if the polyA positions in a cluster spanned more than 40 bp , we applied a peak-finding algorithm as follows . For each genome coordinate in the region corresponding to the tag cluster , we defined the read count as the number of reads whose polyA position overlapped the coordinate . From these we first identified the genome coordinate ( posM ) with the greatest read count ( MaxHeight ) . We then delineated a window 40 bp upstream and 40 bp downstream of this coordinate . Within this window , we retained all coordinates with read counts greater than 10% of MaxHeight . Of these , we identified the most 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 polyA positions ( posL and posR ) . All reads in the tag cluster were then divided into three new candidate tag clusters: reads with positions 5\u2032 to posL , reads with positions including and between posL and posR , and reads with positions 3\u2032 to posR . If the distance between posL and posR was longer than 40 bp , the middle candidate tag cluster was eliminated from further analysis . If the read counts of all coordinates in a candidate tag cluster were below 10% of MaxHeight , the candidate unit was eliminated . If a candidate tag cluster contained coordinates with read counts larger than 10% of MaxHeight , we identified the coordinate with the largest read count within this candidate tag cluster and repeated the peak-finding algorithm . For each tag cluster retained for analysis , we defined the polyA position of the unit as the median of the polyA positions of all reads encompassed by the unit . After establishing that the stretch of A's in each read represented a mismatch to the genome sequence ( see above ) , we filtered out reads with a potential origin from internal priming from A-rich regions of the genome by removing any tag cluster whose defined polyA position was followed by 10 or more A's in the genome sequence within 20 bp . We also filtered out reads with a potential origin as PCR clones or false mapping as follows . We expected that for a given set of paired-end reads falling into a tag cluster , the characteristics of read ends originating from biological 3\u2032-end processing should be distinct from the characteristics of read ends originating from fragmentation , reverse transcription , and ligation during RNA-seq library preparation . In particular , we reasoned that the polyA positions of a set of reads in a tag cluster with origin as a biologically relevant transcript would be less heterogeneous than the positions of the other mates of the reads . If the opposite were true , we considered the tag cluster to be a likely product of false mapping or PCR duplication . As such , we retained a tag cluster for analysis only if the precision of polyA positions across the reads of the unit was greater than the precision of the positions of the other mates . The precision was calculated by where ni is the number of reads at the ith position and N is the total number of reads in the tag cluster . We also filtered out any tag cluster whose total read count across all samples amounted to fewer than 50 reads . For tag clusters with read counts between 50 and 100 , we calculated the Pearson correlation coefficient R between each pair of the two biological replicates across the six cell line samples , and eliminated the tag cluster from further analysis if the absolute value of R was less than 0 . 5 . For use in searches for regulatory motifs , we harnessed all 3\u2032-end RNA-seq reads in tag clusters from all samples to define a consensus base at each position in 3\u2032 UTRs as follows . At every genomic coordinate covered by five or more 3\u2032-end RNA-seq reads , the consensus nucleotide was chosen as that with highest frequency across the sample . If the second most abundant base was more than 20% in abundance , it was incorporated into the consensus using an ambiguous base notation ( M\u200a=\u200aA or C , R\u200a=\u200aA or G , W\u200a=\u200aA or T , S\u200a=\u200aC or G , Y\u200a=\u200aC or T , K\u200a=\u200aG or T ) . For every tag cluster , the consensus sequence of the region 40 bp upstream from the polyA position was searched for a polyadenylation signal using the known hexamer motifs sorted by their abundance in the human genome from [30] . Polyadenylation signals with higher abundance were given higher priority when there was more than one instance in the 40 bp upstream window . In the absence of a match to these motifs , the 40 bp upstream window was searched for an A-rich stretch as follows . We identified any 9 bp regions containing at least 6 A's and considered each such region a candidate polyadenylation signal; if no such candidate signal were present , we considered the tag cluster not to have an identifiable polyadenylation signal . If more than one candidate signal was present , we retained the one with the most A's . For each boundary of this region , if the boundary nucleotide was an A , the region was extended to include all consecutive A's . If the first base was not an A , it was trimmed until the first base was an A . To find upstream U-rich elements ( USE ) , for a given tag cluster , we identified a candidate USE as the 9-bp window with the highest number of T's in the consensus sequence , within 30 bp upstream of the polyadenylation signal . If there were fewer than six T's or if the candidate did not have three consecutive T's , we considered the tag cluster not to have an identifiable USE . For each boundary of a given candidate window , if the boundary nucleotide was a T , the window wasextended if there was a T in the adjacent 2 bp and the proportion of T's in the window was above 65%; if the boundary base was not a T , we trimmed the candidate window until a T was reached . To find downstream U/G-rich elements ( DSE ) , for a given tag cluster , we identified a candidate DSE as the 9-bp window with the highest number of T's in the consensus sequence , within 40 bp downstream of the poly-A position . If there were fewer than five T's or if the window did not contain at least one of the strings TTT , TGTG , GTGT , GTCT , CTGT , TCTG , or TGTC , we considered the tag cluster not to have an identifiable DSE . For each boundary of a given candidate window , if the boundary nucleotide was a T , the window was extended if there was a T in the adjacent 2 bp and the proportion of T's in the window was above 50%; if the boundary base was not a T , we trimmed the candidate window until a T was reached . Human gene annotations were downloaded from the Known Genes database of the UCSC Genome Browser [63] . Among the UCSC transcript annotations that overlapped the start and end positions of a tag cluster , the annotation with the minimum distance between the annotated 3\u2032-end position and the polyA position of the tag cluster was chosen . If there were multiple annotations with the same 3\u2032-end positions , we chose the annotation with greatest degree of overlap between the tag cluster consensus sequence and the annotated exons . The genomic coordinates of human expressed sequence tags ( ESTs ) with polyA tails were downloaded from the polyA_db2 database [64] . The genomic coordinates were converted from hg17 to hg18 using the liftOver tool from the UCSC Genome Browser [65] . If the coordinate of polyA_db2 EST was between the start and end position of a tag cluster , we considered the length form corresponding to the unit to be supported by the EST . All tag clusters with the same UCSC gene annotation were categorized as associated with the gene , and only the two tag clusters with the highest expression per gene were used for classification of alternative polyadenylation . We classified each gene as follows: class I if there was only one tag cluster overlapping with the annotated 3\u2032 UTR of the gene; class II if both tag clusters overlapped with the annotated 3\u2032 UTR of the gene and they were associated with the same UCSC transcript ID; class III if one of the tag clusters overlapped witha coding exon or intron , or if both tag clusters overlapped with 3\u2032 UTRs with different UCSC transcript IDs . We calculated the broad-sense heritability in polyA positions using biological replicates of 3\u2032-end RNA-seq across the six human cell lines as follows . For a given gene , we considered the polyA position of the most abundant tag cluster in each replicate of each sample as a quantitative trait , and calculated the heritability H2 of this trait from intraclass correlations [66] given by the following equations . Here , indices i and j refer to sample and replicate , respectively; is the polyA position for sample i , replicate j; is the average between two replicates for sample i; is the average of all samples and replicates; MSe is the error mean square ( within-individual ) and MSb is the between-individual mean square . Heritability of total expression levels for each gene was calculated analogously , using as a quantitative trait the sum of read counts across the gene normalized by the sum of all reads . To identify microRNA binding sites in 3\u2032 UTRs , the Perl script from TargetScan Release 5 . 2 [67] was used to predict miRNA binding sites in the 3\u2032 UTR sequences of all expressed genes . miRNA sequences and families were downloaded from the TargetScan database . Only predicted binding sites with context scores less than \u22120 . 4 were used for analysis . To identify AU-rich elements , the class II motif WWWT ( ATTTA ) TTTW was searched in the 3\u2032 UTR sequences of all expressed genes allowing up to one mismatch outside the central pentamer , ATTTA . Overlapping motifs were combined . To identify GU-rich destabilizing elements , the motif TGTTTGTTTGT was searched in 3\u2032 UTR sequences allowing up to one mismatch . To identify Pumilio binding elements , the motif TGTANATA was searched in 3\u2032 UTR sequences . Alu transposable element motifs were taken from RepeatMasker ( www . repeatmasker . org ) downloaded from the UCSC Genome Browser . We note that each search strategy used human sequence data alone rather than inter- or intra-species conservation to identify motifs . SNPs within the human population were downloaded from the 1000 Genomes Project database [68] . Genomic coordinates were converted from hg19 to hg18 using the liftOver tool from the UCSC Genome Browser [65] . For each regulatory element motif , the SNP rate was calculated as the total number of SNPs within all motif matches divided by the sum of the lengths of all matches . For the background model of sequence variation in 3\u2032 UTRs used in Table S4 , we first tabulated all instances of A , C , T , and G across all positions of 3\u2032 UTR sequences in the hg18 human reference genome , where the boundaries of 3\u2032-ends were taken from our compendium of 3\u2032-end RNA-seq data for genes expressed in our samples . We refer to these frequencies as P ( A ) , P ( C ) , P ( T ) , and P ( G ) , respectively . We then tabulated the SNP rate separately for each of these four sets of base positions from the 1000 Genomes data set , which we refer to as P ( SNP , A ) , P ( SNP , C ) , P ( SNP , T ) , and P ( SNP , G ) , respectively . We used these values to calculate the expected density of polymorphisms for the stretch of genome corresponding to a given 3\u2032 motif match as: where is the sequence of bases of length Ns corresponding to the motif match in the human reference genome and P ( SNP|si ) is the probability of a single-nucleotide polymorphism for the nucleotide si at position i , calculated as: For each regulatory motif , P ( SNP|s ) was calculated for every instance of a motif match across all 3\u2032 UTRs in the reference genomefor genes expressed in our samples , and the lower and upper bounds listed in Table S4 were taken as the minimum and maximum values of this distribution , respectively . For miRNA binding sites , only the 7-mer seed sequence was used . The DEFOG web-based tool ( http://www . mooneygroup . org/defog ) was used for Gene Ontology term enrichment analysis in Table S5 as follows . For each type of regulatory element analyzed in Figure 2C , we tabulated a list of class II genes with motifs in the shared region only , and combined these lists across elements . For each Gene Ontology term , we then evaluated the significance of the representation of genes annotated in the term in this list , relative to a background set of class II genes harboring at least one motif , using DEFOG with default parameters . Separately , we tabulated an analogous combined list of class II genes with motifs in the differential region only and repeated the DEFOG analysis . To find polymorphisms in 3\u2032 UTRs across the six individuals of our sample , we generated mRNA-seq libraries [69] from one biological replicate of each cell line sample , and sequenced using 36 bp paired-end modules on an Illumina 2G Genome Analyzer , resulting in 21 to 24 million reads per sample . The sequenced reads were mapped to the human genome ( hg18 ) using MOSAIK ( http://bioinformatics . bc . edu/marthlab/Software_Release ) . Mapped reads ( 10 to 14 million per sample ) yielded an average coverage of 48% of UCSC annotated exons with an average depth of 27 reads/base for the covered bases . Mapped reads were used to call SNPs using GigaBayes ( http://bioinformatics . bc . edu/marthlab/Software_Release ) with options \u2013ploidy diploid \u2013O 3 \u2013indel \u2013CAL 10 . Only SNPs with a quality score higher than 0 . 99 were retained for analysis . This set of SNPs was used in association tests with total gene expression levels as follows . Given tag cluster definitions for each gene from analysis of 3\u2032-end RNA-seq libraries ( see above ) , we calculated a normalized expression level for each tag cluster in each sample as the ratio between the number of 3\u2032-end RNA-seq reads mapping within the tag cluster boundaries in the sample and the total number of mapped 3\u2032-end RNA-seq reads in the sample . We then defined the expression level of a given gene in a given sample as the sum of all normalized expression levels across all tag clusters in that gene . To get a final estimate of gene expression level for use in association tests in Figure 3 and Figure 8 , we summed expression values across the two replicate samples from each cell line . For each SNP in the 3\u2032 UTR of a gene , we identified the major allele across all cell lines and scored each diploid genotype in terms of the number of major alleles ( values ranging from 0 to 2 ) . Given the complete matrix of gene expression levels and genotypes across all six cell lines , we calculated the Pearson correlation coefficient R between allele counts and the started logarithm of the gene expression level . For Figure 3A and Figure 8 , we used the absolute value of R as the association statistic , and for Figure 3B , we used the signed value of R . In cases of alternative polyadenylation , SNPs in polyadenylation signals upstream of a maximum of two major length forms were considered for association tests . To analyze the effect of genetic variation in polyadenylation signal strength on expression in Figure 3B , each allele of each polyadenylation signal was assigned a score: 1 if the signal was AATAAA or ATTAAA , 0 . 5 if the signal was a match to the \u201cvariant\u201d polyadenylation motifs in [30] , and 0 otherwise . The polyadenylation signal strength difference was calculated by subtracting the strength of the minor allele from the major allele . In Figure 3A , we analyzed SNPs in 3\u2032 UTRs for 4214 genes and SNPs in polyadenylation signals for 33 genes . In Figure 8 , we analyzed regulatory element SNPs in 62 , 16 , 7 , and 20 genes respectively in 3\u2032 UTRs of class I genes , shared regions of 3\u2032 UTRs of class II genes , differential regions of 3\u2032 UTRs of class II genes whose long forms were more abundant , and differential regions of 3\u2032 UTRs of class II genes whose short forms were more abundant . A psiCheck-2 vector ( Promega ) was modified to generate a 3\u2032 UTR reporter vector , pOKY001 ( Figure S5 and Table S8 ) , in which we removed the SV40 late polyA signal from the firefly luciferase gene and replaced it with a tag for ligation independent cloning ( LIC ) [70] of 3\u2032 UTR sequences of interest . Genomic DNA was isolated from lymphoblastoid cell lines using the MasterPure DNA Purification Kit ( Epicentre ) , and 3\u2032 UTR sequences were amplified from genomic DNA using Phusion HF Polymerase ( New England Biolabs ) with PCR primers with LIC tags . PCR products were cloned into pOKY001 using LIC , and plasmids were purified using Plasmid Midi Kit ( Qiagen ) . Site-directed mutagenesis of plasmids was performed using QuikChange XL Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit ( Agilent ) according to the manufacturer's instructions . All primers used for PCR and mutagenesis are listed in Table S7 . Cloned sequences of all reporter vectors were checked by capillary sequencing . The list of reporter vectors is provided in Table S8 . HEK293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% non-essential amino acids in six-well culture plates . For each of two independent transfections for each construct , at 90% confluency , 1 \u00b5g of plasmid DNA was transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 ( Invitrogen ) according to the manufacturer's instructions . After incubating at 37\u00b0C under 5% carbon dioxide for 24 h , the cells were washed with Dulbecco's Phosphate-Buffered Saline ( DPBS ) , detached from plates by adding 300 \u00b5L of trypsin-EDTA and incubated at 37 degrees for 5 minutes . After adding 900 \u00b5L of media , the detached cells were split into three 2 mL tubes , and pelleted by spinning at 1000\u00d7 g for 3 minutes . The cell pellets were washed with DPBS and then flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at \u221280\u00b0C . Given one cell pellet from each of two reporter transfections ( see above ) , cells from each pellet were lysed and used for two technical replicates of a dual luciferase assay using the Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay System ( Promega ) . Luminescence from the activities of firefly and Renilla luciferases were measured sequentially in a Turner BioSystems Veritas Luminometer . The ratio of luminescence measurements between Firefly and Renilla luciferases was used for all analyses . To measure expression of short and long forms for a given gene with alternative polyadenylation , we considered quantitative PCR assays that would interrogate regions just upstream of the inferred cleavage sites of the short and long forms ( which we refer to below as SU and LU , respectively ) . We reasoned that expression measurements of SU would reflect abundance of both the short and long transcript forms , whereas LU would reflect abundance of the long form only . For a given transcript in a given experiment , the absolute mRNA level ( calculated from quantitative PCR reactions on a biological sample and standards , as described below ) from the primer set amplifying LU was used as the expression level for the long form; the expression level of the short form was calculated by subtracting the absolute mRNA level of LU from the absolute mRNA level of SU for all genes except IRF5 . Primer sequences for IRF5 were taken from [15] , where the primer set for SU hybridized to the polyA tail and only amplified the short form . Thus , for IRF5 , the mRNA count from SU was used as the expression level for the short form . All other primers were designed using Primer3 Plus [71] , checked for potential hairpins and primer dimers using BeaconDesigner Web Edition ( PREMIER Biosoft International ) . Primers were synthesized by Elim Biopharmaceuticals . For each transcript in each experiment , measurements were normalized by absolute mRNA counts of Renilla luciferase or GAPDH genes . All primer sequences are in Table S7 . Expression measurements on cells transfected with 3\u2032 UTR reporters were performed as follows . Given one cell pellet from each of two transfections ( see above ) , total RNA was isolated from each pellet separately using TRIzol ( Invitrogen ) . For each sample , genomic DNA was removed from 10 \u00b5g of total RNA using TurboDNase ( Ambion ) . Single-stranded cDNA was synthesized from 2 \u00b5g of DNased RNA using oligo ( dT ) ( Invitrogen ) and SuperScript III reverse transcriptase ( Invitrogen ) , and then RNA was removed using RNase H ( Invitrogen ) . For each of two technical replicates for each primer set and sample , the cDNA was amplified using the DyNamo HS SYBR Green QPCR Kit ( Thermo Scientific ) for 40 cycles on a Strategene MX3000P qPCR instrument . We calculated absolute numbers of mRNA molecules amplified from each primer set in each experiment by comparing the number of amplification cycles taken to reach a given threshold against a standard curve constructed using samples of a synthetic template ( gBlocks Gene Fragments , Integrated DNA Technologies ) of known absolute numbers of molecules , in serial dilutions extending from 107 to 101 molecules . Reporters incorporating 3\u2032 processing signals were constructed as follows . For each length form of each gene , we aimed to clone a region centered on the cleavage site as inferred from the transcript end position observed in 3\u2032-end RNA-seq , bounded by the 40 bp upstream and 40 bp downstream in the genomic sequences and flanked by LIC tags ( region sequences for EIF2A , IRF5 , DIP2B , and NAB1 were taken from the haplotype giving rise to production of both long and short forms for cell lines GM17220 , GM10860 , GM10860 , and GM17220 respectively ) . This 115-bp construct was produced by PCR stitching two opposite-strand DNA oligos of 60 bp and 78 bp ( Integrated DNA Technologies ) with 23 bp overlap using Phusion HF Polymerase ( New England Biolabs ) for 3 cycles . PCR products were cloned into pOKY001 and purified as described above . Transfection and dual luciferase assay were performed as above . For each transcript half-life measurement , cells transfected with a luciferase reporter harboring the complete 3\u2032 UTR from the haplotype giving rise to production of both long and short forms of a given gene were incubated at 37\u00b0C under 5% carbon dioxide for \u223c24 h . A stock solution of actinomycin D dissolved in DMSO was added to achieve a final actinomycin D concentration in tissue culture media of 10 \u00b5g/mL . After incubation times as indicated in Figure 5 and Figure S4 , cells were harvested for quantitative PCR measurements as above or Northern blotting as described below . To generate expression vectors for ARE-binding proteins , the tristetraprolin ( gene name ZFP36 ) coding sequence was amplified from the vector pGFP-TTP and the AUF1 p37 coding sequence from pCDEF-His-AUF1-p37 ( both kind gifts from B . Glaunsinger ) . Each gene was cloned into the pcDNA3 mammalian expression vector ( Invitrogen ) . Syn-has-miR-101 , a miRNA mimic of has-miR-101 , was purchased from Qiagen ( MSY0000099 ) . For dose-response assays , expression vectors or miRNA mimic were mixed with the corresponding luciferase reporter vectors ( Figure 6 ) and then transfected as above . Lipopolysaccharide from E . coli K12 ( Invivogen ) was added to each of the human B-lymphoblastoid cell lines GM10860 , GM17106 , and , GM17207 to a final concentration of 5 \u00b5g/mL in 6-well tissue culture plates , and incubated at 37\u00b0C under 5% carbon dioxide . The cells were harvested after 0 , 1 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 12 , and 16 hours by centrifuging at 1000\u00d7 g for 3 minutes , washing with DPBS , and then flash-freezing in liquid nitrogen . RNA was isolated using Trizol ( Invitrogen ) . The DIG Northern Starter Kit ( Roche ) was used for Northern blotting . A 400 bp region of firefly luciferase gene was amplified from luciferase reporter vector pOKY001 , and cloned into pcDNA3 vector ( Invitrogen ) . A digoxigenin ( DIG ) labeled RNA probe for firefly luciferase was created by in vitro transcription with SP6 RNA polymerase after linearizing the plasmid with BamHI . Total RNA isolated using Trizol ( Invitrogen ) was cleaned using RNeasy columns ( Qiagen ) with on-column DNase-digestion . Between 1 and 10 \u00b5g of total RNA was loaded and run on 1% denaturing agarose gels . The gels were stained with SYBR Gold ( Invitrogen ) and then the separated RNA was blotted onto nylon membranes ( Roche ) and UV cross-linked . Both the gels and the membranes were imaged on Blue Light Transilluminator ( Invitrogen ) to check the transfer of SYBR-stained RNA . 28S ribosomal RNA bands on the membranes were used as the loading control in Figure S4 . Each membrane was subjected to prehybridization , probe hybridization , low and high stringency washing , and detection procedures recommended by the manufacturer ( Roche ) . Anti-digoxigenin-AP ( Roche ) and CDP-Star ( Roche ) were used for chemiluminescent detection of the DIG-labeled RNA probe . To maximize length resolution for EIF2A , total RNA was incubated at 37\u00b0C for 30 min with RNaseH ( Invitrogen ) and an oligo antisense to a 20 bp region upstream of the binding site for the Northern probe in the firefly gene . For DIP2B , the denaturing agarose gel was treated with 0 . 05% NaOH and washed with water before blotting onto the nylon membrane .

{"lay_summary": "Annually , more than two million people are infected with HIV , the virus that causes AIDS . Due to the ability of the virus to escape host immune responses , designing a successful HIV vaccine has been elusive . Similar to HIV in humans , rhesus macaques can be infected with SIV , a close relative and ancestor of HIV , resulting in simian AIDS . SIV\u0394nef , a live attenuated form of SIV , protects rhesus macaques from subsequent challenge with pathogenic SIV and is widely viewed as the most effective SIV vaccine . Here , we demonstrate that after vaccination of macaques with SIV\u0394nef , the immune response initially targets more variable regions of the virus , which the virus rapidly escapes . However , as the virus escapes , the immune response evolves to target more conserved regions of the virus as well as escape variants . This refocused targeting of conserved regions by the immune response provides a new mechanistic model that contributes to our understanding of how SIV\u0394nef vaccination protects animals from pathogenic challenge with SIV . Our findings also reinforce the importance of developing HIV vaccines that target conserved regions of the virus as well as their potential variants .", "article": "The live attenuated simian immunodeficiency virus ( LASIV ) vaccine SIV\u0394nef is one of the most effective vaccines in inducing protection against wild-type lentiviral challenge , yet little is known about the mechanisms underlying its remarkable protective efficacy . Here , we exploit deep sequencing technology and comprehensive CD8 T cell epitope mapping to deconstruct the CD8 T cell response , to identify the regions of immune pressure and viral escape , and to delineate the effect of epitope escape on the evolution of the CD8 T cell response in SIV\u0394nef-vaccinated animals . We demonstrate that the initial CD8 T cell response in the acute phase of SIV\u0394nef infection is mounted predominantly against more variable epitopes , followed by widespread sequence evolution and viral escape . Furthermore , we show that epitope escape expands the CD8 T cell repertoire that targets highly conserved epitopes , defined as anentropic specificity , and generates de novo responses to the escaped epitope variants during the vaccination period . These results correlate SIV\u0394nef-induced protection with expanded anentropic specificity and increased response depth . Importantly , these findings render SIV\u0394nef , long the gold standard in HIV/SIV vaccine research , as a proof-of-concept vaccine that highlights the significance of the twin principles of anentropic specificity and repertoire depth in successful vaccine design . \n Two decades ago , a report described a cohort of rhesus macaques infected with the live attenuated simian immunodeficiency virus ( LASIV ) , SIV\u0394nef , and subsequently protected from pathogenic wild-type SIV challenge [1] . Since then , numerous studies have demonstrated the efficacy of SIV\u0394nef-induced protection , ranging from complete protection with sterilizing immunity to partial protection with two or more logs reduction in peak and set-point viremia [2\u20136] . Remarkably , presumably in part due to the replication of SIV\u0394nef in mucosal sites [7] , robust protection has been also been documented following mucosal challenges [3\u20135] . SIV\u0394nef has also induced significant protection against heterologous challenge , albeit less effectively than against homologous challenge [4 , 5] . However , studies describing disease progression in SIV\u0394nef-vaccinated infant macaques and a subset of adult non-human primates precluded live attenuated HIV from being developed as a vaccine in human subjects [8\u201310] . Due to concerns over safety , research on SIV\u0394nef and related LASIV vaccines has shifted from safety-and-efficacy determination to mechanism-of-action delineation . As the most effective lentiviral vaccine , SIV\u0394nef has been extensively studied in order to shed light on the correlates of vaccine-mediated protection . However , no immunological correlate or mode of action has consistently been identified as being responsible for protection against pathogenic challenge . SIV\u0394nef generates a diverse SIV-specific antibody response [11 , 12] and macaques vaccinated with the related attenuated virus SIV\u03943 and lacking the Mamu-A*01 MHC I allele show effective control of pathogenic viral challenge despite CD8 T cell depletion [13] , implying that humoral immunity may play a significant role , at least in some genotypic backgrounds . Innate immunity has also been implicated as a correlate of SIV\u0394nef-induced protection [3] . SIV\u0394nef infection induces potent CD8 T cell responses similar in magnitude to wild-type SIV infection [14] , and multiple studies have implicated SIV-specific CD8 T cells in the protection induced by SIV\u0394nef [4\u20136 , 15] . Most recently , Fukazawa et al . [6] correlated the magnitude of lymph node SIV-specific T cell responses with protection elicited by a range of different LASIV strains , including SIV\u0394nef . Finally , studies in a related vaccine challenge model involving vaccination with an attenuated SHIV strain have implicated SIV-specific CD8 T cell responses in the female reproductive tract as playing a crucial role in protection [16] . In this work , we sought to scrutinize the interplay of the attenuated virus and the immune response at a high resolution . We chose to focus on the CD8 T cell response as the most likely immune correlate for protection given that previous studies have demonstrated: potent anti-lentiviral activity of CD8 T cells in vitro [17\u201321]; increased viremia during chronic SIV infection after CD8 T cell depletion [22]; the ability of a live attenuated SHIV vaccine containing HIV env to protect vaccinated macaques against SIVmac239 challenge [16 , 23]; SIV\u0394nef-mediated protection of animals challenged with wild-type SIVmac239 containing highly heterologous env sequences [24]; and a correlation between increased LASIV-induced protection and higher magnitude of SIV-specific CD4 and CD8 T cells in the lymph nodes of vaccinated animals [6] . A distinguishing feature of the SIV\u0394nef and SIV\u03943 vaccines is the gradual increase in protection against wild-type SIV challenge during the first 15\u201320 weeks of vaccination [2 , 25] . Given the low-level replication rate of SIV\u0394nef after initial control of viremia by 8\u201312 weeks after vaccination , it was unknown whether SIV\u0394nef undergoes sequence evolution after acute infection . The only previously documented sequence evolution of SIV\u0394nef was in the Tat SL8 epitope , which escaped as early as 3 weeks post-infection [26] . We hypothesized that , despite low levels of viral replication , SIV\u0394nef undergoes sequence evolution during the vaccination period , which would induce a shift in the specificity of the CD8 T cell response between week 5 , when the animals are not protected , and week 20 , where increased protection plateaus [12] . We made use of high-throughput deep sequencing to quantify SIV\u0394nef sequence variants and their frequencies in vaccinated animals , including those with undetectable plasma viral loads . Concurrently , we fine-mapped the CD8 T cell responses at the epitope level at week 5 and 20 post-vaccination . Studying this cohort of animals longitudinally after SIV\u0394nef vaccination , we demonstrate concomitant coevolution of the virus and the specificity of the CD8 T cell response , resulting in a CD8 T cell repertoire with increased anentropic specificity , wider cumulative breadth , rearranged immunodominance and enhanced depth . \n The animals included in this study were all female Indian-origin rhesus macaques ( Macaca mulatta ) , housed in a biocontainment facility at the New England Primate Research Center ( NEPRC ) . These experiments and procedures were approved by the Harvard Medical Area Standing Committee on Animals . At approval of the study , the assigned protocol number by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee ( IACUC ) was 04383 . The Harvard Medical School animal management program is accredited by the Association for the Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care , International ( AAALAC ) , and meets National Institutes of Health standards as set forth in the 8th edition of the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals [27] . The institution also accepts as mandatory the PHS Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals by Awardee Institutions and NIH Principles for the Utilization and Care of Vertebrate Animals Used in Testing , Research , and Training . There is on file with the Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare ( OLAW ) an approved Assurance of Compliance ( A3431-01 ) . All animals were housed indoors in an SOP-driven , AAALAC-accredited facility . Husbandry and care met the guidance of the Animal Welfare Regulations , OLAW reporting and the standards set forth in The Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals . All research animals were enrolled in the NEPRC behavioral management program , including an IACUC-approved plan for Environmental Enrichment for research primates . This program included regular behavioral assessments , and provision of species appropriate manipulanda , and foraging opportunities . This protocol had an IACUC-approved exemption from social housing based on scientific justification . Primary enclosures consisted of stainless steel primate caging provided by a commercial vendor . Animal body weights and cage dimensions were regularly monitored . Overall dimensions of primary enclosures ( floor area and height ) met the specifications of The Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals , and the Animal Welfare Regulations ( AWR's ) . Further , all primary enclosures were sanitized every 14 days at a minimum , in compliance with AWRs . Secondary enclosures ( room level ) met specifications of The Guide with respect to temperature , humidity , lighting and noise level . The animals were provided ad lib access to municipal source water , offered commercial monkey chow twice daily , and offered fresh produce a minimum of three times weekly . Light cycle was controlled at 12/12 hours daily . The animals were subject to twice daily documented observations by trained animal care and veterinary staff , and enrolled in the facility's environmental enrichment , and preventative health care programs . Euthanasia took place at defined experimental endpoints using protocols consistent with the American Veterinary Medical Association ( AVMA ) guidelines . Animals were first sedated with intramuscular ketamine hydrochloride at 20 mg/kg body followed by sodium pentobarbital ( \u2265100 mg/kg ) intravenously to achieve euthanasia . To determine SIV protein-specific T cell responses , 9 whole protein peptide pools were constructed containing 15-mer peptides overlapping by 11 amino acids at 2 . 5 \u03bcg/ml for each . Peptides spanning the SIVmac239 proteome and corresponding to the peptide sequences available from the AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program , Division of AIDS , NIAID , NIH , were synthesized by the Massachusetts General Hospital core peptide facility . The sequence of individual peptides can be found at www . aidsreagent . org . For epitope mapping , a three-dimensional peptide matrix was constructed . The matrix was composed of 87 peptide pools , each containing around 27 to 30 peptides . The 87 peptide pools encompassed the entire SIV proteome with a coverage of 3-fold , such that each of the 823 overlapping peptides spanning the SIVmac239 proteome was represented in 3 different pools . The peptides used for epitope mapping were 15-mer peptides overlapping by 11 amino acids and were obtained from the AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program , Division of AIDS , NIAID , NIH . The sequence of individual peptides can be found at www . aidsreagent . org . The entropy for each epitope within SIVmac239 was determined by calculating the entropy of each 9-amino-acid window within SIVmac239 , which was determined by aligning 10 proteomes of SIVsmm , the ancestral virus of both the clonal SIVmac239 and the quasi-species SIVmac251 . The aligned proteome sequences were then uploaded into the Shannon Entropy-One calculator from the Los Alamos National Database ( http://www . hiv . lanl . gov/content/sequence/ENTROPY/entropy_one . html ) . The program calculates an entropy score for each 9 amino acid sequence in the SIVsmm proteome . In order to detect only IFN-\u03b3-producing CD8 T cells , ELISPOT assays were carried out with PBMCs or lymph node mononuclear cells ( LNMC ) after negative selection of CD4 T-lymphocyte populations fractionated by magnetic bead separation ( CD4 Dynabeads; Dynal , Oslo , Norway ) as previously described [20] . Negatively selected CD4 T cells were >90% CD8 T cells . CD4 T cell-depleted PBMC and LNMC were suspended in R-10 medium and used the same day in ELISPOT assays . Isolated lymph node CD4 T cells were pelleted and used for RNA extraction and cell-associated viral RNA quantitation and sequencing . For quantitation of plasma viral loads in SIV\u0394nef-infected animals , highly specific , real-time RT-PCR assays were performed as described previously [28] . The assay specific for SIVmac239\u0394nef was developed by designing a reverse primer that uniquely recognizes the sequence generated by the deletion of nef coding sequences in SIVmac239 . The nominal threshold for this assay was 30 viral RNA copy equivalents/ml plasma . To sequence lymph node cell-associated viral RNA , cell-associated viral loads were first determined , incorporating qPCR assay primers and probes for SIV gag , rhesus CCR5 and SIVmac239\u0394nef as described [28] . Briefly , pelleted cells were rapidly disrupted in 100 \u03bcl lysis/digestion solution ( 3M GuHCl , 50 mM TrisCl , pH 7 . 6 , 1 mM CaCl2 and 1 mg/ml Proteinase K ) , utilizing a Branson 450 sonifier equipped with a high-intensity cup horn and set at 60% power amplitude ( Branson Ultrasonics , Danbury , CT ) . After continued digestion at 42\u00b0C for 1 hour , 400 \u03bcl of GuSCN/carrier solution ( ~5 . 7 M GuSCN , 50 mM TrisCl , pH 7 . 6 , 1 mM EDTA , 600 \u03bcg/ml glycogen ) was added to completely dissociate RNA-protein complexes . Total nucleic acids were precipitated by addition of 500 \u03bcl isopropanol , collected by centrifugation , and washed with 70% ethanol . This precipitate was air-dried , suspended in 60 \u03bcl 1X TurboDNAse buffer ( ThermoFisher/Ambion ) , and split into 2 equal 30 \u03bcl aliquots for separate RNA and DNA preparation . The samples for DNA determinations were denatured by heating to 100\u00b0C for 5 min and quenched on ice prior to qPCR . Associated with determinations of SIVmac239\u0394nef DNA , cell equivalents based on qPCR for rhesus CCR5 at single haploid copy per genome ( 2 copy equivalents per cell ) were determined on aliquots diluted 1:10 with 5 mM TrisCl , pH 9 . 0 . Copy equivalents of SIVgag and SIVmac239\u0394nef targets were determined as described [28] . For the aliquots reserved for RNA , 20 \u03bcl of a cocktail containing 2 \u03bcl ( 4 Units ) TurboDNAseI in 1X buffer ( ThermoFisher/Ambion ) were added to each , and the samples incubated at 42\u00b0C for 30 min to digest DNA . After digestion , RNA was recovered by addition of 200 \u03bcl of GuSCN solution without glycogen carrier , followed by precipitation with 250 \u03bcl isopropanol and a 70% ethanol wash , as noted above . Genome equivalents based on SIV gag or SIVmac239\u0394nef target sequences were determined as described . The threshold limits of detection for both SIV DNA and SIV RNA were 30 total copies of SIV sequence normalized to calculated cell equivalents . Plasma samples were spun at 14 , 000 rpm at 4\u00b0C for 1 hour in a microcentrifuge . Viral RNA was then isolated using the Qiamp MinElute Virus spin kit according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions . Plasma viral RNA and cell-associated viral RNA ( isolated and quantitated as described above ) were reverse transcribed and amplified using 4 sets of primers to produce 4 overlapping amplicons spanning the entire length of the viral coding sequence using the SuperScript III High Fidelity One-Step RT-PCR kit ( Invitrogen , Life Technologies , Carlsbad , CA ) . PCR products were either purified with the Qiagen MinElute Gel Extraction ( Qiagen ) kit or Agencourt AMPure XP beads ( Beckman Coulter ) . Samples were quantified with the Quant-IT dsDNA HS Assay kit ( Invitrogen ) The four resultant amplicons were combined and then libraries were created and tagged using the Nextera DNA Sample Prep Kit ( Illumina ) . Individually tagged libraries were quantified with the Quant-IT dsDNA HS Assay kit ( Invitrogen ) and the Agilent High Sensitivity DNA kit ( Agilent Technologies ) . Libraries were then pooled together , denatured with NaOH , and run on an Illumina MiSeq using either a 300 or 500 cycle MiSeq Kit ( Illumina , San Diego , CA , USA ) . IFN-\u03b3-producing T-cell responses were enumerated using an enzyme-linked immunospot ( ELISPOT ) assay for detection of macaque IFN-\u03b3 ( Mabtech , Mariemont , OH ) . CD4-depleted PBMC and LN mononuclear cells were stimulated at 2x105 cells per well with peptide pools ( 15-mer peptides overlapping by 11 amino acids at 2 . 5 \u03bcg/ml each ) . Cells were incubated overnight in multiscreen plates ( Millipore ) coated with an IFN-\u03b3 capture antibody , and spots representing IFN-\u03b3-producing T cells were detected in an enzyme-linked , colorimetric assay for bound IFN-\u03b3 . Spots were counted using an automated ELISPOT plate reader ( Zellnet Consulting , New York , NY ) . For epitope mapping , peptide-pool-stimulated wells , containing a number of spots 3 times higher than background and greater than 30 spots per million mononuclear cells , were selected for second round deconvolution . To deconvolute peptide-specific CD8 T cell responses , peripheral and lymph node mononuclear cells , depleted of CD4 T cells , were stimulated with single peptides that were present in at least 2 positive pools of the 87 peptide pools . Wells with responses to single peptides 3 times higher than background and greater than 60 spots per million were considered significant . Comprehensive MHC I typing using pyrosequencing was conducted as described [29] . Total cellular RNAs were converted to cDNA using a Superscript III First-Strand Synthesis System ( Invitrogen ) . Primary cDNA-PCR amplicons spanning 190 bp of exon two of macaque class I sequences were generated with high-fidelity Phusion polymerase ( New England Biolabs ) . Each PCR primer contained one of 12 distinct 10 bp MID tags along with adaptor sequences for 454 pyrosequencing . After purification , primary amplicons were normalized to equimolar concentrations and groups of 12 animals were pooled for GS FLX analysis . The emulsion PCR and pyrosequencing steps were performed with Genome Sequencer FLX instruments ( Roche/454 Life Sciences ) using GS FLX protocols according to the manufacturer\u2019s specifications ( 454 Life Sciences ) at the 454 Sequencing Center ( Branford , CT ) and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign High-Throughput Sequencing Center . Surface staining was carried out by standard procedures for our laboratory as described [30] . Except where noted , all reagents were obtained from BD Biosciences ( San Diego , CA ) and included monoclonal antibodies to the following molecules: CD3 ( clone SP34-2 , APC-Cy7 conjugate ) CD4 ( clone SK3 , PerCP-Cy5 . 5 conjugate ) , CD8\u03b1 ( clone RPA-T8 , Alexa700 conjugate ) , CD28 ( clone CD28 . 2 , PE-Texas Red conjugate , Beckman-Coulter , Fullerton , CA ) , CCR7 ( clone 150503 , Pacific Blue conjugate , custom ) , KI-67 ( clone EH12 . 2H7 , PE conjugate , custom ) , CD127 ( clone R34 . 34 , PE conjugate , Beckman-Coulter ) , perforin ( clone Pf-344 , FITC conjugate , Mabtech , Mariemont , OH ) . Intracellular staining for perforin and KI-67 expression was performed using Caltag Fix & Perm ( Invitrogen , Camarillo , CA ) according to the manufacturer\u2019s suggested protocol . Enumeration of SIV-specific cells using PE- or APC-conjugated tetramers to Mamu-A*01 Gag181\u2013189CM9 and Tat28\u201335SL8 ( kindly provided by Nancy Wilson and David Watkins , Wisconsin National Primate Research Center , Madison Wisconsin ) was performed as described previously [31] . All acquisitions were made on an LSR II ( BD Biosciences ) and analyses were done using FlowJo software ( Tree Star Inc . , Ashland , OR ) . Isotype-matched controls and/or fluorescence-minus-one ( FMO ) controls were included in all assays [32] . All statistical analyses were done using GraphPad Prism software ( GraphPad Software v6 . 0b , Inc . , La Jolla , CA , USA ) . Non-parametric Wilcoxon and Mann\u2013Whitney tests were used for statistical analysis where the sample size was less than 6 . Otherwise , parametric t tests were conducted; p values less than 0 . 05 were assumed to be significant in all analyses . \n To study the effect of epitope escape on the evolution of the CD8 T cell response following vaccination with SIV\u0394nef , we first assessed the extent of viral sequence variation in 12 animals after SIV\u0394nef infection using next generation sequencing ( NGS ) . The vaccinated animals , most of which displayed classical SIV\u0394nef viral replication kinetics of peak viremia at week 2 and viral set-points at or near undetectable levels ( <30 copy Eq/ml ) at week 8 , were followed for 20 to 40 weeks before challenge ( Fig . 1A ) . Plasma viral samples from the 12 vaccinated animals were sequenced at time points ranging from 1 week to 34 weeks post-vaccination . RT-PCR was used to create four overlapping amplicons corresponding to the full-length SIV viral genome . Libraries were prepared from the pool of four amplicons and then sequenced using the Illumina MiSeq platform . Although there was already widespread sequence variation during the first 2 weeks after vaccination with SIV\u0394nef , none of the variants in any of the animals sequenced exceeded a threshold of 10% ( Figs . 1C and S1 ) , suggesting that these variants were not subject to significant selection in vivo during this initial observation period . However , by week 4 post-vaccination , as the viral load declined from peak viremia , there was a significant increase in the prevalence of nonsynonymous mutations that exceeded the 10% threshold . At this time point , plasma viral RNA samples from 12 animals displayed an average of 8 nonsynonymous mutations , each with a greater frequency than 10% ( Figs . 1C and S2 ) . To determine if sequence variation continued to increase between weeks 4 and 20 , plasma viral RNA was sequenced from the 3 macaques with detectable viremia at week 20 . Plasma viral RNA samples from these 3 animals at week 20 had an average of 28 nonsynonymous mutations with a frequency greater than 10% , a marked increase compared to an average of 8 nonsynonymous mutations at week 4 ( Figs . 1C and S3 ) . To determine the extent of sequence evolution in SIV\u0394nef-vaccinated animals that had lower levels of plasma viremia , we analyzed lymph node CD4 T cell-associated viral RNA at week 20 from 3 animals . Follicular helper CD4 T cells , which are localized in secondary lymphoid tissues , are preferentially infected by SIV\u0394nef [33] , and therefore have higher cell-associated viral RNA levels than CD4 T cells in peripheral blood [6] . Sequencing of lymph node CD4 T cell-associated viral RNA at week 20 revealed increased viral sequence variation even in SIV\u0394nef-infected animals with undetectable plasma viremia , albeit at lower levels of variation than observed for viremic animals . Lymph node associated viral RNA sequenced from animals with undetectable plasma viremia had an average of 15 nonsynonymous mutations with a greater frequency than 10% ( Fig . 1D ) , a substantial increase over the 8 nonsynonymous mutations at week 4 for these animals ( S2 Fig . ) . SIV\u0394nef was longitudinally sequenced in 5 animals , from plasma virus at week 4 and either plasma virus or LN CD4 T cell-associated virus at week 20 . Pooling all the variants ( greater than 10% frequency ) for all 5 animals , the average frequency of nonsynonymous mutations increased from 29% at week 4 to 47% at week 20 ( p = 0 . 001 ) ( Fig . 1B ) . Moreover , there was a significant accumulation in the number of nonsynonymous mutations , increasing from an average of 10 nonsynonymous mutations per animal at week 4 to an average of 24 at week 20 ( p = 0 . 031 ) ( Fig . 1E ) . In all animals whose virus was sequenced , there was extensive sequence evolution as measured by the number of nonsynonymous mutations and their frequencies , including in animals with undetectable plasma viral loads . To determine if viral sequence evolution was accompanied by a shift in the epitopes targeted by the SIV-specific CD8 T cell response , we analyzed CD8 T cell responses at weeks 5 and 20 in the 12 vaccinated animals using IFN-\u03b3 ELISPOT assays using overlapping peptide pools spanning the entire SIV proteome . In contrast to increased protection between weeks 5 and 20 , there was a 40% decrease in the magnitude of the SIV-specific CD8 T cell response in peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) between weeks 5 and 20 ( Fig . 2A ) . Similarly , the breadth of the CD8 T cell response did not correlate with increased protection between weeks 5 and 20 , as the number of positive pools remained stable , with an average of 6 stimulating pools detected at week 5 and an average of 5 . 2 pools detected at week 20 in PBMCs ( Fig . 2B ) . A recent report demonstrated that the magnitude of the SIV-specific CD8 T cell response in lymph nodes at week 50 post-vaccination with SIV\u0394nef correlated with protection against intravenous challenge [6] . To determine if the kinetics of the SIV-specific CD8 T cell response in lymph nodes ( LN ) correlated with the increased protection observed between weeks 5 and 20 , we looked at the magnitude and the breadth of the SIV-specific CD8+ T cell response in lymph nodes . Similar to the magnitude of the CD8 T cell response observed in peripheral blood , the magnitude of the SIV-specific CD8 T cell response in lymph nodes decreased modestly , by 25% , between weeks 5 and 20 ( Fig . 2C ) . The breadth of the response , as defined by recognition of peptide pools of 30 peptides each , in the lymph nodes was likewise comparable to the breadth of the response in the periphery ( Fig . 2C ) , with a slight decrease from 5 positive pools at week 5 to 4 positive pools at week 20 . We next examined CD8 T cell responses to Gag and Pol , the two most conserved proteins in lentiviruses , as a fraction of total responses to the SIV proteome , an indicator of the level of conservation of the SIV-specific CD8 T cell response . Intriguingly , there was a significant enrichment of the ratio of the magnitude of Gag and Pol responses to the total SIV-specific CD8 T cell response between weeks 5 and 20 in SIV\u0394nef-vaccinated animals ( p = <0 . 0001 ) ( Fig . 2D ) . The ratio of Gag and Pol responses to total SIV responses increased in every animal between week 5 and week 20 , increasing from an average of 28% at week 5 to 47% at week 20 . To characterize the shift in CD8 T cell specificity at the level of individual epitopes , we mapped the CD8 T cell response to single peptides for 6 animals at weeks 5 and 20 post-vaccination with SIV\u0394nef . Epitope mapping of SIV-specific CD8 T cell responses was conducted on CD8 T cells from lymph nodes . For the 2 animals whose SIV-specific CD8 T cell responses were mapped in both lymph nodes and peripheral blood , there was no significant difference in the epitopes targeted by the CD8 T cell responses in these two sites ( S1 Table ) . Longitudinal epitope mapping in SIV\u0394nef-vaccinated animals revealed a change in the relative immunodominance of recognized epitopes between weeks 5 and 20 after SIV\u0394nef vaccination . Furthermore , the specific SIV epitopes recognized by CD8 T cell responses differed significantly between week 5 and week 20 . Of the 36 CD8 T cell epitopes mapped in the 6 animals at week 20 , only 14 were also recognized at week 5 ( Figs . 3A and S4 ) . Almost two thirds of the responses at week 20 are de novo responses or were not readily detectible at week 5 . As a first step in assessing whether these shifts in epitope specificity reflected increased anentropic specificity of the CD8 T cell response , we examined the conservation of targeted epitopes at different times after SIV\u0394nef vaccination . We assigned every mapped epitope a conservation score by calculating the mean entropy of nine amino acid stretches for all SIV proteins , as determined from the alignment of 10 SIVsmm predicted open reading frames ( Fig . 4 ) . SIVsmm strains were chosen because the virus clone SIVmac239 and the quasispecies SIVmac251 are derived from SIVsmm . Interestingly , in 5 out of 6 animals , the immunodominant response targeted a more conserved epitope ( lower entropy score ) at week 20 than at week 5 ( p = 0 . 039 ) ( Fig . 3B ) . Moreover , 7 of the de novo CD8 T cell responses detected at week 20 targeted highly conserved epitopes with an entropy lower than 0 . 1 . Having established the accumulation of sequence variants between weeks 5 and 20 and a simultaneous shift in the SIV epitopes targeted by the CD8 T cell response , we sought to determine whether the two events were causally related . Overlaying epitopes mapped onto the sequenced virus from the 6 animals vaccinated with SIV\u0394nef demonstrated that there was a high concordance between the occurrence of nonsynonymous mutations and identification of CD8 T cell epitopes . In macaque 225\u201397 , for which we have the most comprehensive set of viral sequence data and longitudinal epitope mapping , almost all of the nonsynonymous mutations ( 7 out of 9 mutations ) with a frequency greater than 50% fell within a mapped CD8 T cell epitope ( Fig . 5A ) , implying a causal link between CD8 T cell pressure and viral escape . Moreover , the nonsynonymous mutations and mapped epitopes not only overlapped spatially but also overlapped temporally . In animals 225\u201397 and 256\u201300 , epitope-specific CD8 T cell responses declined in frequency following escape of the epitope ( Fig . 5B ) . Remarkably , escape epitopes in animal 225\u201397 were themselves overtaken by other epitope variants over time , suggesting CD8 T cell pressure on the escape epitopes as well ( Fig . 5C ) . However , we did not observe sequence variation in all identified CD8 T cell epitopes . As expected , we observed a strong bias favoring the escape of responses targeting highly variable epitopes , as determined by calculated entropy scores . An analysis of the top four responses mapped for each animal at weeks 5 , 20 and 40 after SIV\u0394nef vaccination demonstrated that the escaped epitopes had significantly higher entropy scores than targeted epitopes that did not escape ( p = 0 . 0013 ) ( Fig . 6A ) . Similarly , SIV-specific CD8 T cells can be grouped into maintained responses , which target mostly conserved regions , and waning responses that target escaped epitopes . The magnitude of the variable responses , defined as targeting epitopes with an entropy above 0 . 25 , decreased significantly between weeks 5 and 20 ( p = . 0101 ) and between weeks 5 and 40 ( p = . 0449 ) , whereas the magnitude of the conserved responses was maintained ( Fig . 6B ) . To determine if the selective escape of variable epitopes , coupled with the decline of their CD8 T cell response frequencies , led to an immune response that was increasingly focused on more conserved epitopes , we developed a formula that estimates the conservation level of the immune response . The Response Conservation Index is the sum of all SIV-specific CD8 T cell response frequencies , weighted for entropy . The Response Conservation Index was calculated for every animal at both week 5 and 20 using the formula in Fig . 7 . Importantly , in the six animals whose CD8 T cell responses were mapped , the Response Conservation Index increased significantly between weeks 5 and 20 ( p = 0 . 0156 ) ( Fig . 7 ) . To ascertain that the increased targeting of conserved epitopes in the vaccinated animals was not due to a genetic background enriched for protective MHC I molecules , we conducted comprehensive pyrosequencing of MHC I genotypes in the six animals whose CD8 T cell responses were longitudinally mapped . The cohort displayed a diverse set of MHC I molecules with three animals expressing the protective alleles Mamu-A*01 and Mamu-B*17 , while the rest of the animals did not express any protective MHC I alleles ( Table 1 ) . Notably , increased anentropic specificity was documented in every animal between weeks 5 and 20 regardless of the MHC I background ( Fig . 7 ) . The number of epitopes targeted by the CD8 T cell response did not differ between weeks 5 and 20 , as measured by positive peptide pools ( Fig . 2B , 2C ) or the specific mapped epitopes ( Fig . 8A ) . However , we hypothesized that escaped CD8 T cell responses were not deleted but rather maintained as a central memory T cell pool and , therefore , that the cumulative breadth of the CD8 T cell repertoire , encompassing all previously detected responses in a given animal , may be a more accurate measure of SIV-specific CD8 T cell breadth ( Fig . 8B ) . Phenotypic analysis of SL8-specific CD8 T cells , targeting the highly mutable SL8 epitope , did reveal a shift to a central memory profile between weeks 5 and 20 , characterized by increased cell surface expression of CD28 ( p = 0 . 0087 ) , CCR7 ( p = 0 . 0006 ) and CD127 ( p<0 . 0001 ) , as well as a decrease in intracellular expression of perforin ( p<0 . 0001 ) and Ki67 ( p = 0 . 0194 ) ( Fig . 8C ) . In Mamu-A1*001+ ( previously known as Mamu-A*01 ) animals , SL8-specific CD8 T cell responses are frequently immunodominant during acute infection but quickly decline following the evolution of escape variants , where 82% and 94% of sequenced SL8 epitopes had mutated as early as week 4 in two SIV\u0394nef-vaccinated macaques ( Fig . 8D ) . Although SL8-specific CD8 T cells reached nearly undetectable levels by week 20 as measured by IFN-\u03b3 ELISPOT and SL8-MHC tetramer staining , the responses rebounded in both animals following challenge with SIVmac251 ( Fig . 8D ) . Given the maintenance of responses to escaped epitopes in SIV\u0394nef-vaccinated animals , all escaped responses were included in the calculation of cumulative breadth . In contrast to CD8 T cell breadth , the cumulative breadth of the CD8 T cell response increased significantly from an average of 6 responses per animal at week 5 to an average of 10 responses at week 20 ( p = 0 . 0036 ) ( Fig . 8B ) . Finally , SIV\u0394nef escape , in addition to allowing for anentropic specificity and increased cumulative breadth , contributes to the deepening of the CD8 T cell response . In macaque 256\u201300 , the mapped Mamu-B17-restricted FW9 ( FHEAVQAVW ) epitope was intact at week 5 but the virus fully escaped by week 20 with 99 . 9% of sequenced reads containing the FW9-H831Y variant . To determine if de novo CD8 T cell responses to the escape variant arose , we tested both variants at week 5 and at the latest time point before challenge , week 38 . Lymph node CD8 T cells from macaque 256\u201300 recognized FW9 at week 5 but not at week 38; conversely , the FW9-H831Y escape variant was recognized only at week 38 but not at week 5 ( Fig . 9A ) . Similarly , the GY9-K76R epitope variant was recognized at week 38 but not at week 5 demonstrates increased depth of the CD8 T cell response after the escape of the mapped Mamu-A*02-restricted GY9 ( GSENLKSLY ) epitope ( Fig . 9B ) . These data demonstrate that , at least in a subset of SIV\u0394nef-vaccinated animals , the depth of the CD8 T cell response increased between weeks 5 and 20 as new CD8 T cell responses were mounted against escape variants . \n Taken together , this data set supports a comprehensive model that provides new insights into the mechanism of SIV-specific immunity maturation after SIV\u0394nef vaccination . For the first time , we demonstrate that SIV\u0394nef sequence evolution is widespread after vaccination , not just confined to the previously documented highly mutable epitope of Tat SL8 [26] , and that ongoing sequence evolution occurs even in animals with undetectable plasma viremia . Moreover , we show that the observed sequence evolution can be characterized as viral epitope escape , a consequence of SIV-specific CD8 T cell pressure on the virus as indicated by the many nonsynonymous mutations that appear within mapped CD8 T cell epitopes . Importantly , another direct consequence of immune CTL pressure is the disproportionate escape of highly variable epitopes , which leads to the waning of CD8 T cell responses targeting entropic epitopes and the accumulation of CD8 T cell responses specific for these epitopes . In addition , escaped SIV-specific CD8 T cell responses are maintained as central memory CD8 T cells and , as such , contribute to the increased cumulative breadth of the CD8 T cell response at week 20 post-vaccination with SIV\u0394nef . Finally , epitope escape and the ensuing generation of de novo CD8 T cell responses to these escape variants constitute a deepening of the CD8 T cell repertoire . Our work sheds new light on SIV\u0394nef and other LASIV vaccines and how their functional and mechanistic characteristics are fundamentally different from other vaccines . While many of the recent successful replication competent virus vector-based vaccines such as CMV and RRV are also persistent [34\u201337] , we demonstrate that SIV\u0394nef is not only a persistent vaccine but that , as a lentivirus , it evolves with the immune response it induces and , ultimately , shapes the CD8 T cell response during the vaccination period . This unique characteristic of SIV\u0394nef to mutate allows for maturation of CTL specificity through increased targeting of conserved regions , deepening and broadening of the response . Furthermore , this new model accommodates earlier known properties of LASIV , such as the observation that the level of protection of LASIV vaccines inversely correlates with the level of attenuation of the vaccine [6 , 38] . Based on our current work , we hypothesize that LASIV vaccine efficacy depends on virus evolution , resulting in the concurrent CD8 T cell specificity shift from highly variable to conserved regions of the virus . Highly attenuated viruses , such as SIV\u03944 , which exhibits lower efficacy compared to SIV\u0394nef [38] , would have lower replication rates and less escape events , therefore less opportunity to shape the CD8 T cell response . Despite three decades of HIV research , basic questions of vaccine design remain hotly debated , namely the optimal balance of CD8 T cell response magnitude , breadth and specificity that should be induced by a vaccine . In suggesting that anentropic specificity is a more important correlate of protection in SIV\u0394nef-vaccinated animals than response magnitude , our data corroborates previous work on long-term nonprogressors ( LTNP ) , another important model of spontaneous lentiviral suppression . Research on LTNP has shown that MHC I molecules associated with protection restrict CD8 T cells that target regions within HIV Gag [39 , 40] as well as highly conserved epitopes [41] . However , unlike viral control in LTNP , which is associated with certain protective HLA molecules , we document increased targeting of highly conserved epitopes in all animals regardless of their MHC I genotypic background . Similar to our LASIV-induced protection , viral control in LTNP is correlated with the immunodominance of CD8 T cell responses that target highly conserved epitopes [42] , given that immunodominant CD8 T cells exert more immune pressure [41] . Finally , studies of LTNP revealed the importance of targeting conserved regions during acute infection [41] , before massive depletion of CD4 T cells has occurred [43] . Our research demonstrates that at week 20 , whereas responses to variable regions have waned , the immunodominant SIV-specific CD8 T cells target more conserved epitopes than at week 5 . The presence of immunodominant CD8 T cells exerting pressure on highly conserved regions during acute infection in animals challenged at week 20 post-vaccination , but not at week 5 , could explain the observed difference in protection . Conversely , the absence of immunodominant responses targeting highly conserved regions in animals challenged at week 5 allows the virus to easily escape and the accumulation of anentropic-specific CD8 T cell responses would occur long after acute infection , if at all . In addition to immunodominant SIV-specific CD8 T cells with anentropic specificity , we also show increased cumulative breadth and depth of the CD8 T cell response at week 20 compared to week 5 . The increased cumulative breadth at week 20 is a function of waning escaped CD8 T cell responses that are maintained as central memory CD8 T cells and are recalled upon challenge . It is unclear how effective these responses are at long-term viral suppression , given that they have been escaped and mostly target variable regions of the virus . Still , a recent report suggests that acute-phase SIV-specific CD8 T cells targeting variable regions are important for viral control [44] , indicating that the increased cumulative breadth of the CD8 T cell response at week 20 may also contribute to protection . Moreover , we detected de novo CD8 T cell responses specific to escaped epitope variants , illustrating that viral escape also contributes to increased immune response depth . Although LTNP generate HIV-specific CD8 T cells that cross-react with escape mutants [45] , the generation of de novo CD8 T cell responses to escaped epitopes is rarely observed in adults infected with HIV [46] . In animal 256\u201300 , we identified two such CD8 T cell responses that target variant epitopes at week 38 but were not detectable at week 5 . We only assayed CD8 T cell responses against escape variants of known CD8 T cell epitopes with known MHC I restriction , and only if the MHC I is expressed by the infected animal . The relative frequency of de novo CD8 T cell responses in SIV\u0394nef-vaccinated animals , if verified in future studies , could be due to an intact CD4 T cell compartment that persists well into the chronic phase of LASIV infection . Previous reports have documented rapid escape of variable epitopes during acute HIV-1 infection and maintenance of CD8 T cell responses specific for conserved epitopes into chronic infection [47\u201349] . Here , in the context of SIV\u0394nef , we demonstrate , in addition to rapid escape of variable epitopes and maintenance of existing CD8 T cell responses with anentropic specificity , de novo CD8 T cell responses against novel epitopes and escape variants during chronic infection . Furthermore , we correlate the accumulation of CD8 T cell responses with anentropic specificity and the increased repertoire depth and breadth to the kinetics of SIV\u0394nef vaccine-induced protection . Previous research on the coevolution of lentiviral epitopes and the CD8 T cell response has been conducted in the setting of wild-type infection , and it is unclear that our findings of increased anentropic specificity , cumulative breadth and repertoire depth during SIV\u0394nef vaccination would apply to wild-type lentiviral infection , in which the CD8 T cell response is likely to be impaired by the persistently high antigenic load , CD4 T cell depletion in the gut and microbial translocation-induced immune activation . Notably , we did not see an increased magnitude of the SIV-specific CD8 T cell response in the lymph nodes between weeks 5 and 20 . Fukazawa and colleagues [6] have recently shown that less attenuated LASIVs such as SIV\u0394nef have higher viral replication in the lymph nodes and , in turn , have higher lymph node CD8 T cell responses . Although these results corroborate existing data demonstrating that protection inversely correlates with LASIV attenuation [38] , our data demonstrates that the magnitude of the CD8 T cell response does not correlate with the kinetics of protection , neither in the PBMC nor lymph node compartment . Although our current work supports the importance of conserved responses as a correlate for protection , others have shown that using conserved regions as immunogens may result in a reduction of the total magnitude of responses [50] . It is unknown whether vaccines inducing targeted responses toward conserved regions will make up for the loss of magnitude . Still it is encouraging that we observe increased anentropic specificity in all animals , suggesting that even nonprotective MHC I molecules can target highly conserved epitopes if properly primed . It has also been proposed that the increased protection of LASIV vaccines is due to phenotypic maturation of the CD8 T cell response . It is important to delineate whether observed phenotypic changes in SIV-specific CD8 T cells correlate with LASIV protection and whether CD8 T cell phenotypic maturation is specific to LASIV or can be seen in other vaccines , such as adenovirus- , CMV- and RRV-based SIV vaccines . Finally , although this data set was focused on the CD8 T cell response and its evolution over time post-vaccination , we observed relatively few nonsynonymous mutations in env outside of mapped CD8 T cell epitopes , suggesting that antibody responses induced only modest immune selective pressure on SIV\u0394nef compared to CD8 T cell responses . Although immunodominance , specificity , breadth and depth have been implicated for some time as determinants of a successful CD8 T cell response against HIV/SIV infection , these results demonstrate how such a CD8 T cell response may be induced by the highly protective SIV\u0394nef vaccine . This new model of SIV\u0394nef-mediated protection raises obvious implications for vaccine design , namely that a successful vaccine should focus CD8 T cell responses on conserved regions of the virus and their existing variants . The recent success of viral vectors such as CMV [34\u201336] , RRV [37] , and adenovirus [51] to elicit potent CD8 T cell responses that partially protect rhesus macaques from infection has been an important step forward in vaccine design . However , these vaccines are all derived from DNA viruses , which have significantly lower rates of mutation than lentiviruses , and thus they are unlikely to shape the immune response in a similar fashion to SIV\u0394nef . Our work suggests that immunogens should be carefully chosen for these vectors such that the induced responses preferentially target conserved regions of the virus , as well as existing variants of these regions to increase response breadth and depth simultaneously .", "headings": ["Abstract", "Introduction", "Materials and Methods", "Results", "Discussion"], "keywords": [], "id": "journal.ppat.1004633"}
{"lay_summary": "The opportunistic pathogen Candida albicans is a major risk factor for immunosuppressed individuals , and oropharyngeal candidiasis ( OPC ) is a frequent complication in patients with weakened cellular immunity . The cytokine interleukin-17 ( IL-17 ) plays a critical role for antifungal host defense and was proposed to act by regulating neutrophil recruitment to the oral mucosa . However , although IL-17 can promote neutrophil trafficking in some situations , we recently showed in a mouse model that this is not the case during OPC . Thus , the mechanism governing the neutrophil response to C . albicans remained to be determined . Here , we demonstrate an essential role of IL-1 receptor ( IL-1R ) signaling in the recruitment of neutrophils from the circulation to the infected tissue via enhanced secretion of chemokines and increased output of neutrophils from the bone marrow . We found that IL-1\u03b1 is released from keratinocytes upon invasion of C . albicans and acts on endothelial cells to induce the production of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ( G-CSF ) , a key trigger of emergency granulopoiesis . Thereby , IL-1R signaling translates the local response to the fungus in the oral mucosa into a systemic response that critically contributes to protection from infection .", "article": "Mucosal infections with Candida albicans belong to the most frequent forms of fungal diseases . Host protection is conferred by cellular immunity; however , the induction of antifungal immunity is not well understood . Using a mouse model of oropharyngeal candidiasis ( OPC ) we show that interleukin-1 receptor ( IL-1R ) signaling is critical for fungal control at the onset of infection through its impact on neutrophils at two levels . We demonstrate that both the recruitment of circulating neutrophils to the site of infection and the mobilization of newly generated neutrophils from the bone marrow depended on IL-1R . Consistently , IL-1R-deficient mice displayed impaired chemokine production at the site of infection and defective secretion of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ( G-CSF ) in the circulation in response to C . albicans . Strikingly , endothelial cells were identified as the primary cellular source of G-CSF during OPC , which responded to IL-1\u03b1 that was released from keratinocytes in the infected tissue . The IL-1-dependent crosstalk between two different cellular subsets of the nonhematopoietic compartment was confirmed in vitro using a novel murine tongue-derived keratinocyte cell line and an established endothelial cell line . These data establish a new link between IL-1 and granulopoiesis in the context of fungal infection . Together , we identified two complementary mechanisms coordinating the neutrophil response in the oral mucosa , which is critical for preventing fungal growth and dissemination , and thus protects the host from disease . \n The opportunistic fungal pathogen Candida albicans has emerged as a significant cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide , particularly in immunocompromised individuals [1] . Of the diverse forms of disease manifestations , mucosal infections with C . albicans are by far most abundant [2] . The symptoms reach from mild forms of infection to chronic or recurrent diseases . No licensed fungal vaccines are currently available to prevent disease , and toxicity and resistance to available drugs compromise the effective management of patients . With the ever-increasing population of immunocompromised patients , C . albicans infections thus represent an important socio-economic challenge worldwide . The epithelium constitutes the first point of contact between the fungus and the host [3] . It provides an important physical barrier to prevent fungal invasion . Moreover , it has the capacity to sense and respond to the fungus . By producing inflammatory mediators and antifungal defense molecules the epithelium actively participates in the host response and together with leukocytes , including neutrophils and IL-17-producing lymphocytes , contributes to limiting fungal ( over ) growth . Diverse mutual interactions between leukocytes and the epithelium are critical for mounting a broadly protective response against C . albicans . The epithelium elicits signals in response to the fungus that can promote the inflammatory response [3] , while cytokines such as IL-17 , produced by leukocytes , act on the epithelium to enhance its barrier function and antimicrobial activity [4 , 5] . Neutrophils have been shown to rapidly accumulate in the oral mucosa in response to C . albicans infection , and they critically contribute to prevent invasion of the fungus in underlying tissues and dissemination to the circulation and visceral organs as was shown in a model of acute oropharyngeal candidiasis ( OPC ) [6 , 7] . The relevance of neutrophils in protection from oropharyngeal candidiasis is also evidenced by the high incidence of the disease in hemato-oncological patients with bone marrow aplasia [8 , 9] . Neutrophils comprise a major proportion of circulating peripheral blood leukocytes . They are generated from granulocyte-macrophage progenitors in the bone marrow under the control of granulopoietic growth factors , primarily granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ( G-CSF ) [10] . During acute infection , granulopoiesis is massively enhanced to comply with the increased demand for neutrophils in host defense [11] . Control mechanisms of this demand-adapted hematopoiesis involve long-distance regulatory feedback loops induced at the site of infection where neutrophils act , which is usually distant from the production site of neutrophils in the bone marrow . Increased release of G-CSF in response to infectious and/or inflammatory insult plays a key role in this process [11] . Given the potentially harmful effects of dysregulated neutrophils , granulopoiesis and neutrophil trafficking is under tight control and regulated in a tissue-specific manner [12] . With the discovery of interleukin-17 ( IL-17 ) and the realization of its critical role in defense against mucocutaneous candidiasis [5 , 13] , it was postulated that IL-17 mediates protection by promoting the neutrophil response . Indeed , IL-17 signaling can enhance expression of neutrophil cytopoietic and chemotactic factors in response to C . albicans [14] . However , we recently demonstrated that neutrophils are recruited normally to the site of infection in IL-17 receptor-deficient mice , thus that the IL-17 pathway is not required for the neutrophil response during OPC [6] . Therefore , although neutrophil trafficking may be regulated by IL-17 in some tissues and in response to certain pathogens [15\u201319]\u2014this is not the case during C . albicans infection in the oral mucosa . Alternative candidate factors regulating the neutrophil response include IL-1 . In fact , secretion of both IL-1\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 are efficiently induced in dendritic cells and macrophages when stimulated with C . albicans [20\u201323] and both IL-1 family members were shown to contribute to protection from systemic infection [24] . Epithelial cells also secrete IL-1 cytokines when triggered with C . albicans [25\u201327] , although in mice , unlike in humans , keratinocytes produce only IL-1\u03b1 but no IL-1\u03b2 [28] . Whether and how IL-1 cytokines contribute to antifungal defense in barrier tissues remains poorly defined . Using a mouse model of oropharyngeal candidiasis , we found that IL-1R signaling is critical for host defense by regulating the neutrophil response . We show here that IL-1 acts by two complementary mechanisms . First , it regulates the production of neutrophil-chemotactic factors by epithelial cells for the recruitment of neutrophils from the circulating pool to the site of infection . Second , it induces G-CSF production by the endothelium for enhanced neutrophil output from the bone marrow to meet the increased demand in response to infection . Release of IL-1\u03b1 from keratinocytes upon contact with C . albicans is critical for mediating this crosstalk between the epithelium and the endothelium in the oral mucosa . \n Infection of mice with C . albicans via the oropharyngeal route induces a rapid inflammatory response , characterized by a massive recruitment of neutrophils to the oral mucosa ( Fig 1A , S1 Fig ) [6 , 7 , 29] , which accumulate in proximity to where C . albicans hyphae invade the keratinocyte barrier on the dorsal and ventral side of the tongue [6] . Following from our previous findings that neutrophil trafficking during OPC was independent of the IL-17 pathway [6] , we sought after factors responsible for controlling neutrophil recruitment in response to C . albicans . We found that mice lacking the IL-1 receptor ( IL-1R ) recruited significantly less neutrophils to the site of infection than their wild type ( WT ) counterparts ( Fig 1B ) . In consequence Il1r1-/- mice were unable to control the fungus and displayed an increased fungal load in the tongue on day 3 post-infection ( Fig 1C ) . These data indicated clearly that IL-1R signaling was critical for the neutrophil response during OPC . The rapid accumulation of neutrophils in the oral mucosa of infected mice was paralleled by a strong induction of the neutrophil-recruiting chemokines CXCL1 , CXCL2 and CXCL5 ( Fig 2A ) . Consistent with the role of IL-1 in neutrophil recruitment , chemokine expression in the oral epithelium was impaired in absence of IL-1R signaling ( Fig 2B ) , while basal levels were comparable ( S2 Fig ) . To determine the cellular compartment responsible for chemokine production , we sorted cellular subsets from the tongue of na\u00efve and C . albicans-infected mice on day 1 post-infection , the peak of the neutrophil response , including CD45+ leukocytes , CD45- EpCAM+ CD31- keratinocytes and CD45- EpCAM- CD31+ endothelial cells ( S3 Fig ) and analyzed chemokine expression at the transcriptional level . The keratinocyte fraction displayed the highest RNA levels , and the induction in response to infection was most prominent in this population ( Fig 2C ) . Consistent with this result , a cell line of tongue-derived keratinocytes ( TDKs ) also secreted neutrophil-attracting chemokines in an IL-1-dependent manner in vitro ( Fig 2D ) . These data suggested that the neutrophil response to OPC is initiated locally in the infected mucosa . While C . albicans may directly induce chemokine expression in keratinocytes , their production is strongly enhanced by IL-1R signaling . In addition to the strong induction of the neutrophil-recruiting chemokines during OPC , the expression of Csf3 , the gene coding for G-CSF , was also markedly induced in the infected oral mucosa ( Fig 3A ) , suggesting that it may contribute to the overall neutrophil response during OPC by boosting granulopoiesis and neutrophil egress from the bone marrow . We therefore analyzed typical surrogate hallmarks of emergency granulopoiesis in the bone marrow . While total numbers of CD45+ cells in the bone marrow were unchanged in infected mice compared to na\u00efve controls ( Fig 3B ) , we observed a reduction in mature Ly6Ghi CD11b+ Ly6Cint neutrophils ( Fig 3C and 3D ) . This response was paralleled by an increase in Ly6Glo CD11b+ Ly6C- immature neutrophils ( Fig 3C and 3E ) . These reciprocal changes in mature and immature neutrophils in the bone marrow indicated that G-CSF , which was induced by the local infection with C . albicans , acted at a distance and thereby elicited a systemic response . Indeed , neutralization of G-CSF impaired the induction of emergency granulopoiesis during infection ( Fig 3F and 3G ) . The increased demand for neutrophils in the infected tissue was thus compensated by an increased rate of granulopoiesis and mobilization of neutrophils from the bone marrow . The increased neutrophil output from the bone marrow was relevant for the local antifungal response as indicated by the fact that depletion of the circulating neutrophil pool with an anti-Ly6G-specific antibody ( 1A8 ) was not sufficient to blunt the neutrophil response to C . albicans [6] . Instead , the combination of anti-Ly6G and anti-G-CSF was required for efficient depletion of neutrophils in the blood and in the infected tissue ( Fig 3H and 3I ) resulting in a total loss of fungal control ( Fig 3J ) . Note that the reduction of neutrophils by ~1 log ( Fig 3I ) resulted in a ~4-log increase in fungal load over a course of 3 days ( Fig 3J ) , while the ~0 . 5 log reduction in neutrophils in absence of IL-1 signaling ( Fig 1B ) lead to a ~2-log increase in fungal load over the same period of time ( Fig 1C ) . Given the prominent role of G-CSF for the overall neutrophil response during OPC we wanted to understand the regulation of this growth factor in more detail . For this , we isolated again CD45+ leukocytes , CD45- EpCAM+ CD31- keratinocytes , and CD45- EpCAM- CD31+ endothelial cells from the tongue of C . albicans-infected mice and uninfected controls as above ( S3 Fig ) and analyzed Csf3 transcript levels in each population . Surprisingly , the most prominent expression was observed in the endothelial cell population ( Fig 4A ) . Although keratinocytes were previously shown to secrete G-CSF in response to C . albicans in vitro [26] , their contribution in vivo was minor ( Fig 4A ) . Similarly , leukocytes expressed only very low levels of G-CSF during OPC ( Fig 4A ) . To corroborate this unexpected finding , we examined G-CSF protein production by the different cell subsets . Because we were unable to visualize intracellular G-CSF by flow cytometry , we prepared cell lysates from sort-purified tongue cell populations and quantified their G-CSF content by ELISA . Again , by far the highest production of G-CSF was detected in the endothelial cell fraction isolated from infected mice ( Fig 4B ) . Further separation of the CD45- EpCAM- CD31+ population in podoplanin-positive and podoplanin-negative subsets confirmed that blood endothelial cells rather than lymph endothelial cells were responsible for G-CSF production during OPC ( S4 Fig ) . Production of G-CSF by endothelial cells was supported by the observation that high levels of G-CSF could be detected in the serum of infected mice ( Fig 4C ) . Together , these data suggested that G-CSF , which is induced in response to local infection with C . albicans , acts at a distance to promote granulopoiesis and neutrophil mobilization in the bone marrow and thereby sustains a systemic neutrophil response that meets the increased demand of these cells during OPC . Next , we investigated how G-CSF secretion by endothelial cells is regulated during OPC . Direct stimulation of endothelial cells by C . albicans appeared unlikely given their spatial distribution in the oral mucosa . We made use of VE-cadherin-cre x ROSA26-RFP reporter mice [30] to visualize the blood and lymphatic vessels in situ and infected them with GFP-expressing C . albicans ( Fig 5A ) . In immunocompetent animals , fungal hyphae were restricted to the avascular tongue epithelium without penetrating the basal epithelial layers . The absence of direct contacts of C . albicans with endothelial cells suggested that G-CSF production was regulated indirectly . Given the important role of IL-1 for the overall neutrophil response to C . albicans , we assessed the IL-1 dependence of G-CSF during OPC . The induction of Csf3 transcripts was less pronounced in the oral mucosa of Il1r1-/- mice ( Fig 5B ) , while basal levels were unchanged ( S2 Fig ) . Likewise , G-CSF protein expression by endothelial cells that were sorted from infected tongues was drastically diminished in absence of IL-1R signaling ( Fig 5C ) . This translated in strongly diminished G-CSF levels in the serum of C . albicans-infected Il1r1-/- mice compared to WT controls ( Fig 5D ) . In contrast , TNF , which had been proposed to regulate G-CSF expression in vitro [31] , was not involved in G-CSF production during OPC ( S5 Fig ) . As a consequence of the G-CSF defect in Il1r1-/- mice , emergency granulopoiesis was strongly impaired during OPC in these mice , as indicated by the higher ratio of mature to immature neutrophils in the bone marrow of infected Il1r1-/- mice compared to WT controls ( Fig 5E and 5F ) . Importantly , Il1r1-/- mice responded to G-CSF treatment , and the administration of recombinant G-CSF was sufficient to fully overcome the defect in emergency granulopoiesis in these mice ( Fig 5G and 5H ) . Together , these data demonstrated , that G-CSF secretion during OPC was controlled by the IL-1 pathway . G-CSF production appeared to underlie a different regulatory mechanism compared to neutrophil chemokine production during OPC given their distinct cellular sources , despite the fact that both , chemokines and G-CSF , depended on IL-1R signaling . Next , we examined the expression of IL-1\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 , the two activating ligands of the IL-1R . Both were found strongly induced during OPC ( Fig 6A ) . IL-1\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 contribute to G-CSF production during OPC because the induction of G-CSF expression in the oral mucosa and its release into the serum were strongly impaired in absence of IL-1\u03b1 or IL-1\u03b2 ( Fig 6B and 6C ) . IL-1\u03b2 was expressed predominantly by the hematopoietic compartment as assessed by flow cytometric analysis of intracellular pro-IL-1\u03b2 ( S6 Fig ) . To determine the cellular source of IL-1\u03b1 in the murine tongue , we applied an immunofluorescence approach , which allowed us to detect IL-1\u03b1 with high specificity on tissue sections . Basal expression levels observed in the keratinized epithelium of the tongue in na\u00efve mice were strongly enhanced upon infection ( Fig 6D ) . Co-staining with antibodies specific for keratinocytes of the tongue ( keratin-6 ) or those of stratum basale ( keratin-14 ) [32] revealed that IL-1\u03b1 was predominantly produced by differentiated keratinocytes ( Fig 6E ) . Note that the IL-1\u03b1 signal was absent in neutrophil-rich areas , which were identified by DAPI staining . The availability of preformed IL-1\u03b1 ( but not IL-1\u03b2 ) protein in steady-state ( Fig 6D , S6 Fig ) , which can be rapidly released in response to stimulation , together with the strategic position of keratinocytes as the first contact point between the host and the infecting fungus , suggested that keratinocyte-derived IL-1\u03b1 likely functions as an \u2018alarmin\u2019 right at the onset of infection to alert the host about fungal invasion and to initiate a protective antifungal response . As such , keratinocyte-derived IL-1\u03b1 may also act on endothelial cells and thereby contribute to the neutrophil response during OPC . To delineate the putative crosstalk between keratinocytes and endothelial cells in more detail , we made use of a newly generated cell line of mouse tongue-derived keratinocytes ( TDKs ) ( S7 Fig ) . TDKs expressed high levels of EpCAM and keratin-6 indicating that they represented differentiated oral keratinocytes [32] . Their concurrent expression of keratin-14 was consistent with their origin of basal keratinocytes with stem cell properties . Consistent with published data with keratinocytes from other sources [26] , TDKs released IL-1\u03b1 when stimulated with C . albicans ( Fig 7A ) . Notably , and in contrast to human keratinocytes [28] , mouse keratinocytes released no IL-1\u03b2 ( Fig 7B ) . This response was dependent on live and hyphenating fungus because heat-killed or a yeast-locked C . albicans did not induce IL-1\u03b1 ( Fig 7C ) . Likewise , IL-1\u03b1 was not induced with zymosan , a yeast cell wall extract , or curdlan , a pure \u03b2-glucan preparation ( Fig 7A ) . Consistent with our in vivo data , the overall amount of IL-1\u03b1 detected from TDKs in response to live C . albicans resulted from the release of preformed cytokine and de novo biosynthesis of IL-1\u03b1 ( Fig 7D ) . Next , we tested the effect of TDKs and TDK-derived IL-1\u03b1 on endothelial cells for G-CSF induction ( Fig 8A ) . For this , we employed an established endothelial cell line , MS1 [33] . TDKs and MS1 cells both did not produce G-CSF when directly stimulated with C . albicans nor with curdlan or zymosan , although they responded strongly to LPS , which was included as a positive control ( Fig 8B and 8C ) . However , MS1 cells secreted high amounts of G-CSF when stimulated with the sterile-filtered supernatant of C . albicans-stimulated TDKs ( Fig 8D ) . This response was dose-dependent ( Fig 8E ) and only observed when TDKs were stimulated with life and hyphenating C . albicans , but not with heat-killed C . albicans , a yeast-locked strain of C . albicans or inert fungal cell wall components such as zymosan and \u03b2-glucan ( curdlan ) ( Fig 8D\u20138F ) . Similar results were obtained when supernatant of freshly isolated mouse oral keratinocytes stimulated with C . albicans was added to MS1 cells ( S8 Fig ) . This indicated that a C . albicans-induced TDK-derived soluble factor was responsible for G-CSF production by endothelial cells . To test whether this factor was IL-1\u03b1 , we added anakinra ( IL-1R antagonist ) or a neutralizing anti-IL-1\u03b1 antibody into the supernatant-transfer assay . This resulted in a complete abolishment of the response ( Fig 8G\u20138I ) , while adding an anti-IL-1\u03b2 antibody had no effect on G-CSF induction by TDK-derived factors ( Fig 8I ) , consistent with the notion that IL-1\u03b2 was not produced by murine keratinocytes ( Fig 7B ) . IL-1\u03b1 was not only necessary but also sufficient for triggering G-CSF production in endothelial cells , because MS1 cells secreted large quantities of G-CSF when stimulated with recombinant IL-1\u03b1 ( Fig 8J ) . In summary , these results revealed a novel IL-1\u03b1-dependent crosstalk between epithelial and endothelial cells that mediates the induction of G-CSF by C . albicans . In conclusion , our data corroborate the notion that the epithelium takes an active part in host defense in barrier tissue through its strategic location and by alerting the immune system about the presence of a pathogenic threat . By demonstrating the relevance of IL-1\u03b1 release ( for G-CSF induction ) and chemokine secretion , we provided an example in a physiologically relevant system . \n In this study , we describe an essential function of the IL-1 pathway in antifungal immunity in the murine oral mucosa . We demonstrated how IL-1R signaling regulates the neutrophil response against C . albicans in two ways to prevent fungal growth and dissemination . Specifically , it promotes the production of chemokines by oral keratinocytes for neutrophil recruitment from the circulating pool , and it induces G-CSF secretion from endothelial cells to enhance granulopoiesis in the bone marrow to meet the rapid demand for neutrophils in the tissue . IL-1R signaling thereby translates the local response to a tissue-specific infection into a systemic response . The availability of preformed IL-1\u03b1 from keratinocytes , which are the first cells to be exposed to C . albicans during infection , is critical for the initiation of the response . Together , our data demonstrate how signaling through the IL-1R coordinates a cellular crosstalk between keratinocytes , endothelial cells and neutrophils for optimal control of C . albicans in the oral mucosa . Rapid infiltration of neutrophils to the site of infection is a hallmark of the inflammatory response to OPC and critical for the confinement of the fungus in the mucosal epithelium [6] . The neutrophil response in the oral mucosa was originally thought to be controlled by the IL-17 pathway , which itself is highly critical for fungal control during OPC [14] . However , previous work from our laboratory showed that the key protective function of IL-17 is uncoupled from the neutrophil response [6] . Although IL-17 signaling can enhance the expression of neutrophil chemokines and granulopoietic factors [14] , IL-17 is not required for neutrophil chemotaxis and function during OPC [6] . Instead , neutrophil trafficking to the oral mucosa during acute infection is under the control of IL-1R signaling as our data demonstrate . IL-1R deficiency is associated with impaired neutrophil recruitment and defective fungal control in response to OPC . Our data are consistent with previous reports demonstrating a role for IL-1R signaling in antifungal defense in different settings including systemic candidiasis [24] , a model of mixed oral and systemic candidiasis [34] , A . fumigatus keratitis [35] and invasive pulmonary aspergillosis [36] . The mechanism of IL-1R-mediated protection , however , was not addressed in most of these studies . Here , we used the model of OPC to dissect the impact of IL-1R signaling on neutrophil mobilization and recruitment in response to C . albicans infection at a cellular and molecular level . Keratinocytes take center stage in the coordination of the IL-1-mediated neutrophil response during OPC . They act as the major producers of neutrophil-recruiting chemokines . Chemokine production by keratinocytes was greatly enhanced by IL-1R signaling and at least in part through the autocrine activity of IL-1\u03b1 . A similar mechanism for enhanced chemokine secretion by keratinocytes was described before in the context of Staphylococcus aureus skin infection [37] . A second mechanism , by which keratinocytes promote the neutrophil response during OPC , is by the induction of G-CSF via their capacity to produce IL-1\u03b1 . Our data thus link IL-1 signaling and G-CSF production . G-CSF regulates granulopoiesis and neutrophil mobilization in the bone marrow , which is critical to meet the rapidly increasing demand of neutrophils in the infected tissue . Administration of recombinant G-CSF in mice is sufficient to drive emergency granulopoiesis as we and others have shown [38] , and recombinant G-CSF is widely used therapeutically to treat neutropenia [39] . G-CSF has also been used successfully in the treatment of chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis [40] . Besides its host-beneficial role in hematopoiesis and protection from infection , dysregulated production of G-CSF has been linked to autoinflammatory disorders such as psoriasis and inflammatory arthritis [41\u201343] and targeting G-CSF has been proposed as a therapeutic approach against these diseases [44] . We identified endothelial cells in the oral tissue to be the major producers of G-CSF during OPC , while we were unable to detect G-CSF expression by murine keratinocytes in response to C . albicans . Direct secretion of G-CSF into the bloodstream by endothelial cells facilitates its delivery to the distant bone marrow and the induction of a systemic response . During systemic bacterial infections , G-CSF production by the endothelium was shown to be a direct and TLR4-dependent response of the vasculature to endotoxin stimulation which lead to the induction of emergency granulopoiesis [38] . During OPC , we found no evidence for direct response of the endothelium to C . albicans , and endothelial cells were not activated by the fungus in vitro . Instead , G-CSF was produced as a result of an IL-1-dependent crosstalk between keratinocytes and endothelial cells . IL-1\u03b1 was critical for the secretion of G-CSF into the circulation during OPC , and it was sufficient for stimulating G-CSF production by endothelial cells in culture , consistent with a published report [31] . In contrast , TNF , which was also reported to induce G-CSF production by endothelial cells in vitro [31] , did not regulate G-CSF production during OPC . In addition to IL-1\u03b1 , IL-1\u03b2 also contributes to the antifungal response in vivo and at least partially compensates in absence of IL-1\u03b1 . IL-1\u03b2 was also induced in the oral mucosa during infection . Consistent with the notion that murine keratinocytes are unable to produce IL-1\u03b2 [28] , we found this cytokine to be expressed by the hematopoietic compartment . IL-1\u03b2 induction in response to C . albicans was shown previously to depend on the NLRP3 inflammasome in different infection models [21 , 34 , 45] and NLRP3 was required in the hematopoietic compartment [29] . In addition to the NLRP3 inflammasome , the NLRC4 inflammasome was also shown to contribute to protection from OPC [29] . Whether its function at the level of the mucosal stroma is linked to the IL-1 pathway and whether it is involved in IL-1\u03b1 production in keratinocytes was not addressed . We found that the overall IL-1\u03b1 response resulted from the release of preformed and intracellularly stored IL-1\u03b1 on the one hand , and from the induction of de novo synthesis on the other hand . The release of IL-1\u03b1 from keratinocytes correlates with the induction of cell damage [46] , suggesting that IL-1\u03b1 release may be a consequence of cell death induced by fungal invasion . It remains to be determined whether IL-1\u03b1 secretion by oral keratinocytes in response to C . albicans infection depends on caspase-1 as was shown to be the case for bone marrow-derived MNPs differentiated with GM-CSF [20] . The dependence of IL-1\u03b1 secretion on life and filamenting fungus is consistent with the implication of candidalysin in this process . This fungal peptide toxin has recently been identified as a critical virulence factor promoting epithelial cell damage and the release of cytoplasmic molecules , some of which may act as alarmins [47] . Importantly , our data demonstrate the biological relevance of keratinocyte-derived factors induced by C . albicans for the induction of inflammation and protection from infection in vivo , and they dissect the mechanism how IL-1 coordinates the neutrophil response against the fungus in the oral epithelium . \n All mouse experiments described in this study were conducted in strict accordance with the guidelines of the Swiss Animal Protection Law and were performed under protocols approved by the Veterinary office of the Canton Zurich , Switzerland ( license number 201/2012 and 183/2015 ) . All efforts were made to minimize suffering and ensure the highest ethical and humane standards . WT C57BL/6J mice were purchased from Janvier Elevage . Il1a-/- mice ( a kind gift from Manfred Kopf ) [48] , Il1b-/- mice [48] ( a kind gift from Manfred Kopf and Hans-Dietmar Beer ) and Il1r1-/- mice [49] were bred at the Laboratory Animal Service Center ( University of Z\u00fcrich , Switzerland ) . VE-cadherin-cre x ROSA26-RFP reporter mice [30] and Tnf-/- mice ( a kind gift from Annette Oxenius ) [50] were bred at the Rodent Center HCI at ETH Z\u00fcrich . All mice were on the C57BL/6 background , kept in specific pathogen-free conditions and used at 6\u201315 weeks of age . For neutrophil depletion , mice were treated with anti-Ly6G ( clone 1A8 , BioXCell , 150\u03bcg per mouse i . p . on day -1 ) and/or anti-G-CSF ( clone 67604 , R&D Systems , 10\u03bcg per mouse per day i . p . starting from day -1 ) , as indicated . For inhibition of emergency granulopoiesis , mice were treated with anti-G-CSF ( 10\u03bcg per mouse per day i . p . on day -1 and day 0 ) . For induction of emergency granulopoiesis , mice were injected with human recombinant G-CSF ( Filgrastim , Amgen , 5 \u03bcg/mouse i . p . at 5h and 17h post-infection ) . The C . albicans strain SC5314 was used for all experiments except where stated otherwise . The yeast-locked strain hgc1\u0394/\u0394 and its revertant hgc1\u0394/\u0394:HGC1 [51] were obtained from N . Gow ( Aberdeen ) . The strain pACT1-GFP [52] was obtained from C . Reis e Sousa . All strains were grown in YPD medium at 30\u00b0C for 15\u201318 hours . Mice were infected with 2 . 5x106 cfu C . albicans sublingually as described [53] without immunosuppression . Mice were monitored for morbidity and euthanized in case they showed severe signs of pain or distress . For determination of fungal burden , the tongue of euthanized animals was removed , homogenized in sterile 0 . 05% NP40 in H2O for 3 minutes at 25 Hz using a Tissue Lyzer ( Qiagen ) and serial dilutions were plated on YPD agar containing 100 \u03bcg/ml ampicillin . The detection limit corresponds to one colony divided by the mean weight of the tongues in the experiment . For heat-killing 108 yeast cells were boiled for 45 minutes . Preformed hyphae were generated in keratinocyte medium at 37\u00b0C , 5% CO2 for 24 hours . Mice were anaesthetized with a sublethal dose of Ketamine ( 100 mg/kg ) , Xylazin ( 20 mg/kg ) and Acepromazin ( 2 . 9 mg/kg ) , and perfused by injection of PBS into the right heart ventricle prior to removing the tongue and/or the bones . Tongues were cut into fine pieces and digested with DNase I ( 200 \u03bcg/ml , Roche ) and Collagenase IV ( 4 . 8 mg/ml , Invitrogen ) in PBS at 37\u00b0C for 45\u201360 minutes . Single cell suspensions were passed through a 70 \u03bcm strainer using ice-cold PBS supplemented with 1% FCS and 2 mM EDTA and analyzed by flow cytometry ( see below ) . For intracellular cytokine staining , tongue leukocytes were enriched over a 40% percoll gradient before antibody staining and analysis . Bone marrow was flushed from femurs using PBS and passed through a 70 \u03bcm strainer using ice-cold PBS supplemented with 1% FCS and 2mM EDTA . Erythrocytes were lyzed using erythrocyte lysis buffer ( 0 . 3 M NH4Cl , 28 \u03bcM NaHCO3 , 125 \u03bcM EDTA ) , and leukocytes were analyzed by flow cytometry . Tongue-derived keratinocytes ( TDKs ) were obtained from WT mice . The tongue was cut to obtain ventral and dorsal parts . The dorsal part of the tongue was freed from muscle tissue with a scalpel and floated on DMEM ( PAA ) containing 0 . 8% trypsin ( Thermo Fischer ) for 40 minutes with the epithelial side facing upwards . After incubation , the epithelial tissue was separated from the lamina propria , and keratinocytes were isolated by incubating in DMEM medium containing DNase I ( Roche , 200 \u03bcg/ml ) for 30 minutes and occasional vortexing and filtering through a 70 \u03bcm strainer . The cells were pelleted , resuspended in keratinocyte medium ( S1 Table , adapted from [54] ) and cultivated in cell culture plates coated with collagen ( Bornstein and Traub Type IV , Sigma Aldrich , 25\u03bcg/ml ) . The blood endothelial cell line MS1 [33] was kept in DMEM medium supplemented with 5% FCS and Penicillin/Streptomycin . Prior to stimulation experiments , TDK and MS1 cells were rested for 48 hours and then stimulated with recombinant IL-1\u03b1 ( Peprotech , 20 ng/ml ) , IL-1\u03b2 ( Peprotech , 20 ng/ml ) , anakinra ( 250 \u03bcg/ml ) , zymosan ( 20 \u03bcg/ml ) , curdlan ( 200 \u03bcg/ml ) , LPS ( 100 ng/ml ) or C . albicans at MOI = 3 for 24 hours . Amphotericin B was added 8 hours post-stimulation where stated explicitly . Supernatants were collected for analysis . In some cases , cell lysates were generated by adding 0 . 1% Triton-X 100 in PBS to the supernatant-free cells . To determine the total amount of IL-1\u03b1 in cells and supernatant , Triton-X 100 was added to separate culture wells at a final concentration of 0 . 1% . For supernatant transfer experiments , TDKs were stimulated for 24 hours as described , supernatants were removed , sterile-filtered and added to MS1 cells at a 1:3 dilution . G-CSF production by MS1 cells was determined by ELISA after 24 hours ( see below ) . In some experiments , TDK supernatants were treated with anti-IL-1\u03b1 ( clone ALF-161 , BioXCell , 20 \u03bcg/ml ) and/or anti-IL-1\u03b2 ( clone B122 , BioXCell , 20 \u03bcg/ml ) before they were added to MS1 cells , or MS1 cells were pretreated with anakinra for 30 minutes before addition of TDK supernatant . All antibodies were from BioLegend , if not stated otherwise . For flow cytometry analyses of neutrophils , single cell suspensions of tongues , bone marrow or blood were stained in ice-cold PBS supplemented with 1% FCS , 5 mM EDTA , and 0 . 02% NaN3 with LIVE/DEAD Fixable Near-IR Stain ( Life Technologies ) , anti-CD45 . 2 ( clone 104 ) , anti-CD11b ( clone M1/70 ) , anti-Ly6C ( clone AL-21 , BD Biosciences ) and anti-Ly6G ( clone 1A8 ) . For flow cytometry analyses of tongue keratinocytes and endothelial cells , single cell suspensions were stained in ice-cold PBS supplemented with 1% FCS , 5 mM EDTA , and 0 . 02% NaN3 , with LIVE/DEAD Fixable Near-IR Stain or 7AAD ( BD Pharmingen ) , anti-CD45 . 2 ( clone 104 ) , anti-EpCAM ( clone G8 . 8 ) and anti-CD31 ( clone MEC13 . 3 ) . In some experiments , anti-podoplanin ( clone 8 . 1 . 1 ) was included . For intracellular cytokine staining , tongue cells were first incubated in LIVE/DEAD Fixable Near-IR Stain and surface marker antibodies . After fixation and permeabilization using BD Cytofix/Cytoperm ( BD Biosciences ) the cells were incubated in Perm/Wash buffer ( BD Biosciences ) containing anti-pro-IL-1\u03b2 ( clone NJTEN3 ) or the respective isotype control antibody . Cells were acquired on a FACS LSRII ( BD Biosciences ) or on a FACS Gallios ( Becton Coulter ) , and data were analyzed with FlowJo software ( Tristar ) . For all experiments , the data were pre-gated on live single cells . For isolating tongue cell subsets by FACS sorting , single cell suspensions of five tongues were pooled , stained as described above , and sorted on a FACS AriaII ( BD Biosciences ) using FCS as a collection medium . Isolation of total RNA from bulk tongues or sorted cell populations was carried out according to standard protocols using Trizol Reagent ( Sigma ) or Trizol LS Reagent ( Life Technologies ) . cDNA was generated by RevertAid ( Thermo Scientific ) . Quantitative PCR was performed using SYBR Green ( Roche ) and a Rotor-Gene 3000 ( Corbett Research ) or a QuantStudio 7 Flex ( LifeTechnologies ) .

All qPCR assays were performed in duplicate and the relative gene expression ( rel . expr . ) of each gene was determined after normalization with \u03b2-actin transcript levels . For the preparation of cell lysates from sorted tongue cell populations , Brefeldin A ( 250 \u03bcg / mouse ) was injected i . p . 6 hours before removal of the tongue tissue . Brefeldin A was also added during the antibody staining and supplemented in the collection medium during cell sorting . Sorted cells were washed with PBS , and 400\u2019000 cells of each population ( 60\u2019000 for na\u00efve leukocytes , 25\u2019000 for LECs ) were lysed in 100 \u03bcl 0 . 1% Triton-X 100 in PBS containing cOmplete protease inhibitor cocktail ( Roche ) using a Tissue Lyzer ( Qiagen ) for 3 minutes at 25 Hz . The G-CSF content of the lysates was analyzed immediately by ELISA ( see below ) . G-CSF protein in the serum , in cell lysates or in cell culture supernatants was determined by sandwich ELISA using purified anti-G-CSF ( clone 67604 , R&D Systems ) for coating and biotinylated polyclonal rabbit anti-G-CSF ( Peprotech ) for detection according to standard protocols . For determination of IL-1\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 levels in cell culture supernatants , cytometric bead array assays ( BD Biosciences ) were performed according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions . The detection limits are indicated by a dotted line . Tongues were embedded in OCT ( Sakura ) , snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -20\u00b0C . For immunofluorescence staining , sagittal cryosections ( 9 \u03bcm ) , were fixed with acetone for 10 minutes at room temperature and stained with anti-IL-1\u03b1 ( clone ALF-161 , BioXCell ) , anti-K6 ( BioLegend , poly19057 ) , anti-K14 ( BioLegend , poly19053 ) and 4\u2032 , 6\u2019-Diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride ( DAPI , Sigma-Aldrich ) . Slides were mounted with Mowiol ( VWR International AG ) , scanned with a NanoZoomer 2 . 0 HT ( Hamamatsu Photonics K . K . ) using 10x and 20x objectives , and analyzed using NDP . scan 2 . 5 . 88 . All scale bars indicate 100 \u03bcm . For whole mount confocal microscopy , tongues were longitudinally cut with a scalpel and fresh tissue was placed on 35mm microscopy dishes ( IBIDI ) with PBS . Z stack tile scans were acquired with an SP8 confocal microscope ( Leica ) equipped with a 20x APO objective ( 0 . 7 N .

{"lay_summary": "Lymphatic filariasis ( LF ) , commonly known as \u2018elephantiasis\u2019 , is one of the world's most debilitating infectious diseases . In 83 countries worldwide , more than 1 . 3 billion people are at risk of infection with an estimated 120 million individuals already infected . A recent publication reviewing the health impact of the first 8 years of the Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis ( GPELF ) demonstrated the enormous health benefits achieved in populations receiving annual mass drug administration ( MDA ) , as a result of infection prevented , disease progression halted , and ancillary treatment of co-infections . To date , however , no studies have estimated the economic value of these health benefits , either to the individuals or the societies afflicted with LF . Our study estimates that US$21 . 8 billion will be gained among individuals benefitting from just the first 8 years of the Global Programme , and an additional US$2 . 2 billion will be saved by the health systems of endemic countries . Treating endemic populations is possible at very low cost \u2013 particularly because of the generous drug donations from two pharmaceutical companies \u2013 but results in enormous economic benefits . Findings from this study yield a much clearer understanding the GPELF's full economic impact and strengthen the conviction that it is a \u2018best buy\u2019 in global health .", "article": "Between 2000\u20132007 , the Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis ( GPELF ) delivered more than 1 . 9 billion treatments to nearly 600 million individuals via annual mass drug administration ( MDA ) of anti-filarial drugs ( albendazole , ivermectin , diethylcarbamazine ) to all at-risk for 4\u20136 years . Quantifying the resulting economic benefits of this significant achievement is important not only to justify the resources invested in the GPELF but also to more fully understand the Programme's overall impact on some of the poorest endemic populations . To calculate the economic benefits , the number of clinical manifestations averted was first quantified and the savings associated with this disease prevention then analyzed in the context of direct treatment costs , indirect costs of lost-labor , and costs to the health system to care for affected individuals . Multiple data sources were reviewed , including published literature and databases from the World Health Organization , International Monetary Fund , and International Labour Organization An estimated US$21 . 8 billion of direct economic benefits will be gained over the lifetime of 31 . 4 million individuals treated during the first 8 years of the GPELF . Of this total , over US$2 . 3 billion is realized by the protection of nearly 3 million newborns and other individuals from acquiring lymphatic filariasis as a result of their being born into areas freed of LF transmission . Similarly , more than 28 million individuals already infected with LF benefit from GPELF's halting the progression of their disease , which results in an associated lifetime economic benefit of approximately US$19 . 5 billion . In addition to these economic benefits to at-risk individuals , decreased patient services associated with reduced LF morbidity saves the health systems of endemic countries approximately US$2 . 2 billion . MDA for LF offers significant economic benefits . Moreover , with favorable program implementation costs ( largely a result of the sustained commitments of donated drugs from the pharmaceutical industry ) it is clear that the economic rate of return of the GPELF is extremely high and that this Programme continues to prove itself an excellent investment in global health . \n As a leading cause of permanent and long-term disability worldwide , the parasitic infection lymphatic filariasis ( LF ) imposes a severe physical and socioeconomic burden on 1 . 3 billion at-risk persons in 83 endemic countries . An estimated 120 million people are already infected with LF , with about 40 million suffering from overt clinical disease manifested as painful severe swelling due to lymphedema ( generally an accumulation of lymphatic fluid in the limbs ) and hydrocele ( fluid accumulation in the scrotal sac ) . To rid the world of this debilitating disease , the Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis ( GPELF ) was begun in 2000 to guide endemic countries in implementing single-dose , once-yearly mass drug administration ( MDA ) using a combination of either albendazole+ivermectin or albendazole+diethylcarbamazine ( DEC ) for an anticipated 4\u20136 years . Use of this effective strategy for LF elimination has become feasible because of the drug donations of albendazole and ivermectin from their pharmaceutical manufacturers , GlaxoSmithKline and Merck & Co . , Inc , respectively . Over the first 8 operational years of the GPELF ( 2000\u20132007 ) , more than 1 . 9 billion MDA treatments were administered to approximately 570 million individuals in 48 countries . This significant programmatic achievement has resulted in a notably beneficial impact on the health of endemic populations [1] . More than 6 million cases of hydrocele and 4 million cases of lymphedema have been prevented , resulting in over 32 million disability-adjusted life years ( DALYs ) averted and numerous quality-of-life benefits attained . What remains relatively undefined , however , is the economic significance of these achievements . Specifically , how much financial cost and loss of income is prevented over the lifetimes of individuals protected from LF due to the first 8 years of the GPELF ? And , what cost savings do national health systems realize from the reduction in LF infection and morbidity ? To date , few attempts have been made to examine LF from an economic perspective , particularly on a global level . Such data , however , is invaluable to policymakers , public health administrators , and program funders who may already be convinced that LF is a \u2018best buy\u2019 in global health but who lack precise estimates to support their conviction . This study offers such an economic analysis and estimates that following the first 8 years of the GPELF , US$21 . 8 billion of economic benefits will be gained by LF infected and non-infected individuals in MDA-treated areas , in addition to US$2 . 2 billion in health systems savings . Furthermore , though this economic assessment has not included the value of the many ancillary benefits on other concurrent infections that are effectively treated by the anti-LF drug regimens , it still leads to a far better understanding of the GPELF's true overall impact on one of society's most debilitating and widespread tropical diseases . \n Key data sources are listed below , though specific sources are cited throughout the paper: For this analysis , two broad groups of individuals are recognized as economically benefitting from the MDA treatment given during the first 8 years of the GPELF: Those protected from acquiring infection ( and subsequent disease [specifically , hydrocele and/or lymphedema] ) ; Those already infected but protected from disease progression . These two groups can be segmented into four sub-populations ( detailed below and summarized in Table 1 ) ; together , they constitute the \u201cbenefit cohort population\u201d . Population estimates for each sub-population were calculated using the same base figures and key assumptions as described previously [1]; namely that 10% of the at-risk population is actually infected with LF , that this ratio would remain constant in the absence of MDA , and that the relative frequency of the clinical disease syndromes will also remain stable among those infected individuals . The previous section defined a 4-part benefit cohort population as the group of protected individuals who will realize economic benefits as a result of MDA activity between 2000\u20132007 . The total economic impact of the GPELF , however , extends over a much longer period than these first 8 years because protection from LF infection or disease progression is a lifelong benefit . It is therefore necessary to aggregate the total economic benefit gained over the projected remaining lifetime of the benefit cohort population . To estimate this total , a general formula ( Figure 1 ) was applied and calculated independently for each country to accommodate country specific differences in several key variables ( life expectancy , mortality rate , direct and indirect costs ) . All calculated costs and benefits are discounted to the base year of 2008 . For this study , 2008 was used as the base year for calculating economic benefits . When calculating future benefits , however , it is necessary to discount values to a net present value ( NPV ) under the economic principle that a dollar earned in the present is worth more than one earned in the future . Therefore , all annual accumulated cost savings beyond 2008 are discounted at 3% per year in accordance to guidelines set by WHO-CHOICE [53] . GPELF program costs can be compared with the economic benefits calculated in this study through a cost-benefit analysis to evaluate the efficiency and practicality of implementing the Global Programme . Estimating program costs , however , is not the intent of this study and such data was , therefore , sourced through our previously published work [54] . On a macro-level , no study has yet been conducted to estimate the total cost of the GPELF over its first 8 years and as a result , a broader programmatic cost-benefit analysis cannot be calculated . It is possible , however , to estimate the cost-benefit on an individual-level using per person costs calculated in a multi-country study of national MDA program costs for LF including training , mapping , mobilization , distribution , monitoring , and surveillance [54] . In this study , Goldman et al . analyzed both the average annual economic cost per person treated ( i . e . including the implied costs of donated materials and drugs \u2013 set at US$0 . 19+$0 . 0019 for shipping per 400mg tablet of albendazole and US$1 . 50+$0 . 0018 per 3mg tablet of ivermectin ) and also the financial cost per person treated ( i . e . excluding the costs of the donated materials and drugs ) from data collected through questionnaires and adjusted for LF-specific activities . Donated ivermectin is used in combination with donated albendazole in areas co-endemic for onchocerciasis in Africa plus Yemen . DEC , which is not donated , is used in combination with donated albendazole in all other countries and must be purchased by national programs . In terms of per person economic benefits , the total economic benefits estimated over one year in this study was divided by the total number of people treated with MDA in that same year . For this analysis , per person economic benefits were only calculated for the 7 countries whose program costs were also evaluated in Goldman et al . 's study . Cost-benefit was then measured using benefit-cost ratios ( BCR ) , which is the per person treated benefit divided by the per person treated cost . For standardization purposes , the BCR reflects costs , benefits , and currencies adjusted to the year of the most recent MDA round in Goldman et al . 's study . \n During the first 8 years of LF MDA , the Global Programme delivered nearly 2 billion treatments and reached almost 570 million individuals in 48 of the 83 identified endemic countries ( Table 4 ) . As a result of these program achievements , 31 . 4 million individuals \u2013 defined in this study as the benefit cohort population \u2013 will gain economic benefits over their lifetime from averting direct treatment costs and indirect lost-labor costs . Of these 31 . 4 million individuals in the benefit cohort population , 2 . 7 million ( 8 . 6% ) would have acquired LF and subsequently progressed to clinical disease but were protected from infection altogether because of interruption of the transmission cycle by MDA . This group comprises the proportion of newborns ( 2 . 2 million ) that are protected by virtue of being born in MDA-treated areas , as well as other individuals in the general population ( 0 . 5 million ) protected because LF transmission has been interrupted . The remaining 28 . 7 million ( 91 . 4% ) individuals are those who were already infected at the time of MDA treatment but benefit from halted disease progression . This population group comprises individuals at the subclinical disease stage ( 9 . 4 million , [29 . 9%] ) who avoid clinical disease altogether and individuals at the clinical disease stage ( 19 . 3 million [61 . 6%] ) whose conditions may improve following MDA . As seen in Table 5 , the efforts in reaching and administering MDA to such a large population have produced extraordinary economic benefits over the first 8 years of the GPELF . An estimated US$21 . 8 billion will be saved over the lifetimes of the 31 . 4 million individuals who have or would have acquired clinical disease during this timeframe . This total amount results from summing the direct treatment costs ( $1 . 4b ) and indirect lost wages ( $20 . 4b ) prevented over the lifetime of each of the population groups under the assumptions and estimates previously outlined in Table 3 . Direct costs for acute disease were calculated based on the aggregate number of ADL episodes expected in the absence of MDA and the average cost incurred per episode . Chronic disease direct costs were derived from the percentage and total number of patients seeking treatment multiplied by the average cost spent per treatment . Indirect costs for both acute and chronic disease were calculated by accruing the equivalent workdays lost to LF and multiplying this total by the average daily wage . All average costs and rate of disease estimates were weighted annually by country-specific estimates and with respect to total number of person-years . On average , each individual of the benefit cohort population will avoid nearly $700 in LF-associated costs that would have accrued over his/her lifetime . This equates to the amount earned for 19 working days per person-year , thus preventing the loss of approximately 6 . 3% of annual income ( Table 6 ) . These sums and averages are even greater when considered in a single year-to-year perspective , since beyond 2008 , each year of economic benefit is discounted by 3% per year . Table 6 also shows that the infected patient sub-population groups ( i . e . clinical and subclinical ) have the greatest total lifetime benefits based on their larger proportion of the total benefit cohort population . On a per person lifetime average , however , subclinical ( Group 2a ) and \u2018other protected individuals\u2019 ( Group 1b ) benefits are larger . Figure 3 highlights the total economic benefit segmented by cost , morbidity , and clinical presentation . Economic benefits to national health systems resulting from reduced LF infections derive particularly from patient service costs averted in the public sector . Approximately US$2 . 2 billion in health system costs will be saved over the lifetime of the benefit cohort population ( Table 8 ) . Combined with the US$21 . 8 billion savings for individuals , the total economic benefit following the first 8 years of the GPELF is estimated at an extraordinary US$24 . 0 billion ( Figure 4 ) . This overall economic analysis of the GPELF's first 8 years does have notable limitations due to the lack of regionalized primary data concerning both epidemiological and socioeconomic factors associated with LF . Indeed , two sections of the model remain with particular uncertainty: 1 ) The degree to which MDA can reverse or return an individual with overt clinical disease to regular productivity , and 2 ) The relationship between hours lost and output/productivity lost due to disease . The total estimated economic impact is particularly sensitive to these variables because of the large number of clinical disease patients receiving MDA and the high proportion of total prevented costs that come from indirect labor costs . As a result , sensitivity analyses were carried out to assess the range of economic benefits that can be achieved under varying estimates of each variable . Secondary sensitivity analyses investigating the frequency and duration of ADL episodes , and direct treatment costs indicated less variability of economic benefits when adjusting these parameters . Goldman et al . found the average annual economic cost per person treated ( i . e . including the implied costs of donated materials and drugs \u2013 set at US$0 . 19+$0 . 0019 for shipping per 400mg tablet of albendazole and US$1 . 50+$0 . 0018 per 3mg tablet of ivermectin ) ranged from US$0 . 40 in Philippines to $5 . 82 in Tanzania . The average annual financial cost per person treated ( i . e . excluding the costs of the donated materials and drugs ) ranged from US$0 . 06 in Burkina Faso to US$1 . 34 in Haiti [54] . One-year economic benefits per person treated in this study ranged from US$1 . 00 in Burkina Faso to US$4 . 56 in the Dominican Republic . Table 10 compares these economic benefit estimates with the economic and financial costs from Goldman et al . 's study to calculate country-specific BCRs . The economic cost BCR for the three African countries using the ivermectin+albendazole regimen are lower ( 0 . 21\u20130 . 37 ) than those in countries using DEC+albendazole ( 1 . 23\u20138 . 59 ) . Since the drugs , however , are available at no cost to the GPELF , BCRs calculated using financial costs are more favorable , ranging from 1 . 64 in Egypt to 18 . 07 in the Philippines . \n In Table 10 , the BCRs calculated with economic costs are low , particularly for the African countries using the ivermectin+albendazole regimen . In reality , however , the whole foundation of the GPELF is the long-term , sustained commitment of drug donations offered by GlaxoSmithKline for albendazole and Merck & Co . , Inc . for ivermectin for as long as needed until LF is eliminated [72] , [73] . Because of this commitment , governments and donors will never have to finance these costs themselves; indeed , without these commitments there would be no GPELF . Therefore , understanding the financial costs ( i . e . excluding the costs of the donated materials and drugs ) to the GPELF is more relevant for policy- and decision-making than is the analysis of economic costs . When comparing financial costs to economic benefits , then , Table 10 shows very favorable BCRs , including up to 18 . 07 in the Philippines . Whether examining financial or economic costs , the BCR becomes larger in the years beyond the recommended 5 rounds of MDA to achieve lifetime protection from LF . The Goldman et al . study [54] showed strong evidence that costs decrease after the initial year of implementation and after 5 rounds of MDA , the drug costs and majority of program activities would arguably subside dramatically as well . In the Philippines for example , by conservatively extrapolating the initial year's annual economic cost over 5 years , the cost to lifetime benefit ratio indicates that a $1 investment leads to a sizable return of $60 per individual treated . While this analysis does not account for costs following the 5th round of MDA ( e . g . post-MDA surveillance ) , it can be reasonably assumed that the BCR would still remain very significant . Indeed , even if annual economic costs were to persist at an equivalent rate for an additional 10 to 15 years , the economic rate of return per person treated is still approximately $20\u2013$30 for every $1 invested . Comparing the cost-benefit of the GPELF to that of other NTD programs is difficult because there are few directly comparable analyses , particularly at a global level . A review of the African Programme for Onchocerciasis Control ( APOC ) projected an economic rate of return of 6% to 17% but did not factor in the implied economic cost of the donated drug [74] . This finding is less than the drug-excluded LF cost-benefit estimate presented here , however , several economic benefits apart from onchocercal blindness prevention were not analyzed in the APOC review . Cost-benefit analyses for trachoma have focused almost exclusively on trichiasis surgery in a localized context [75] . A broader array of cost-benefit studies has been carried out for malaria , although with differing scopes and outcome goals , making it challenging to compare results across the same disease , let alone between malaria and LF . In a review of several malaria costing studies , the BCR ranged from 1 . 9 to 17 . 1 using a variety of human capital and burden of disease methodologies [76] . Other approaches assessing a more macroeconomic impact of malaria [77] , [78] have yet to be applied to NTDs but future research into such cost-benefit applications will be critical for validating the investment of the GPELF and stimulating likeminded investigations for related global NTD programs . There has been considerable movement \u2013 particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa \u2013 toward integrating preventive chemotherapy programs to target multiple NTDs ( e . g . LF , onchocerciasis , schistosomiasis , soil-transmitted helminths [STH] , trachoma ) together . Although there is no clear verdict yet on the benefits of integrated NTD treatments versus standalone vertical programs , early assessments indicate potential savings of 25\u201347% for the entire group of NTDs can be achieved in Sub-Saharan Africa by packaging MDA interventions together [79] . These findings underlie an important concept of economic analysis , specifically that although an intervention ( e . g . vertically integrated MDA programs for LF ) may have a favorable BCR , there may be more cost-effective alternatives to achieving a similar outcome ( e . g . the number of treatments administered , the total economic benefits of the GPELF ) . In this respect , the GPELF is well positioned to take advantage of synergistic opportunities with other disease program activities including vector control ( malaria and dengue fever ) , surveillance ( guinea worm , onchocerciasis ) , and distribution ( integrated NTDs , Vitamin A ) to maximize cost-effectiveness and economic impact [80] . Joint efforts with the private sector and drug development projects addressing improved sanitation and housing facilities could also contribute to greater cost-effectiveness for the GPELF [81] . While this study is not positioned to analyze cost-effectiveness in details , it is abundantly clear that under any joint or standalone scenario , the GPELF indeed represents an excellent buy in global health . The prevention of LF infection and clinical disease has led to additional benefits that are difficult or impossible to quantify in monetary terms . The true economic value of the GPELF is , therefore , arguably much higher based on the numerous quality-of-life benefits achieved through clinical disease aversion , as well as the economic impact that MDA has on other diseases and syndromes related to LF . A narrow range of country-specific primary data somewhat limits the breadth of economic analysis presented in this paper; however , much of the prevailing literature originates from India and Sub-Saharan African countries where over 75% of the benefit cohort population resides . Of significance , there is scarce regional data regarding treatment-seeking behavior for LF patients , but because this is a direct cost input , more exact data would result in only marginal changes to the overall economic impact . Similarly , LF disease-specific parameters ( e . g . ADL frequency and duration , lost workdays ) were attributed a global standardized estimate due to a lack of regional data . Sensitivity analyses conducted earlier in this study presented the resulting economic impact under differing degrees of pathology and indeed , a clearer understanding of regional variability would enrich future economic analyses . Other variables such as wages , health system costs , and direct treatment costs , however , were able to be made region- and country-specific with the aid of international databases from the ILO , WHO , and World Bank . Despite important limitations to our analysis , this study identifies a wide array of economic benefits that have resulted from the first 8 years of the GPELF \u2013 approximately US$21 . 8 billion of direct and indirect patient costs will be prevented in the lifetimes of more than 31 million individuals , US$2 . 2 billion of LF-associated patient services saved by national health systems over the lifetimes of the MDA-treated individuals , and additional quality-of-life benefits and treatment of co-morbidities such as STH that make the total economic value of the GPELF unquestionably far greater than the calculable estimate presented here . These achievements notwithstanding , it is clear that the economic impact will be even greater when the GPELF reaches the remaining endemic countries and at-risk populations . Currently , the GPELF has extended to 48 of the 83 endemic countries and treated nearly 570 million individuals \u2013 approximately 44% of the \u223c1 . 3 billion worldwide at-risk population [8] . Extrapolating this proportion with the US$24 billion lifetime economic benefit already achieved , the full potential economic benefit of the GPELF could be in excess of US$55 billion distributed over each of the endemic WHO regions ( Figure 5 ) . Reaching the remaining at-risk individuals presents notable challenges especially since much of the population not yet reached resides in some of the poorest countries in Africa . Additional resources and economic empowerment will be necessary to assist these countries in implementing programs for LF elimination [91] . The expansion of the GPELF will therefore be a critical building block in this effort and also an important driver for increased attention to NTDs and the continuation of integrated NTD programs . The recognition of the sizable monetary benefit already achieved after 8 years provides new confidence that it is an investment well worth undertaking .", "headings": ["Abstract", "Introduction", "Methods", "Results", "Discussion"], "keywords": ["infectious diseases/neglected tropical diseases", "infectious diseases/helminth infections", "public health and epidemiology/global health", "public health and epidemiology/infectious diseases", "non-clinical medicine/health economics", "infectious diseases/epidemiology and control of infectious diseases"], "id": "journal.pntd.0000708"}
{"lay_summary": "Parkinson\u2019s disease ( PD ) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by intraneuronal accumulation of alpha-synuclein ( \u03b1-syn ) called Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites .

Recent genetic studies have revealed that GBA mutations confer a strong risk for sporadic Parkinson\u2019s disease ( PD ) . To investigate how GBA mutations cause PD , we generated GBA nonsense mutant ( GBA-/- ) medaka that are completely deficient in glucocerebrosidase ( GCase ) activity . In contrast to the perinatal death in humans and mice lacking GCase activity , GBA-/- medaka survived for months , enabling analysis of the pathological progression . GBA-/- medaka displayed the pathological phenotypes resembling human neuronopathic GD including infiltration of Gaucher cell-like cells into the brains , progressive neuronal loss , and microgliosis . Detailed pathological findings represented lysosomal abnormalities in neurons and alpha-synuclein ( \u03b1-syn ) accumulation in axonal swellings containing autophagosomes . Unexpectedly , disruption of \u03b1-syn did not improve the life span , formation of axonal swellings , neuronal loss , or neuroinflammation in GBA-/- medaka . Taken together , the present study revealed GBA-/- medaka as a novel neuronopathic GD model , the pahological mechanisms of \u03b1-syn accumulation caused by GCase deficiency , and the minimal contribution of \u03b1-syn to the pathogenesis of neuronopathic GD . \n Gaucher disease ( GD ) is the most common lysosomal storage disease and is caused by homozygous mutations in glucocerebrosidase ( GBA ) . Mutations in GBA lead to decreased enzymatic activity of glucocerebrosidase ( GCase ) and result in the accumulation of its substrates , glucocerebroside and glucosylsphingosine[1 , 2] . GD is classically divided into three subtypes: a non-neuronopathic form ( type 1 ) , an acute neuronopathic form ( type 2 ) , and a subacute neuronopathic form ( type 3 ) . Visceral manifestations of all forms are characterized by hepatosplenomegaly , cytopenia , and skeletal disease . Pathologically , the accumulation of lipid-laden macrophages , called Gaucher cells , are observed in the affected organs . Neurological manifestations of neuronopathic forms include brainstem dysfunction , intellectual disability , seizures , and myoclonic movement . Pathological features of neuronopathic forms are neuronal loss , astrogliosis , microgliosis , and perivascular accumulation of Gaucher cells[3] . The most severe neuronopathic form , called the perinatal lethal type , has also been reported[4] . Common presentations of patients with the perinatal lethal type are hydrops fetalis and congenital ichthyosis . Almost no residual GCase enzymatic activity is found in these cases . Because currently available therapies are ineffective for neurological manifestations , a strong demand exists for elucidation of the pathological mechanisms and the development of novel therapies . Parkinson\u2019s disease ( PD ) is the most common neurodegenerative movement disorder . GBA has recently drawn considerable attention because heterozygous mutations in this gene confer a high risk for sporadic PD[5 , 6] . In addition , patients with type 1 GD also have an increased life-time risk of developing PD[7] . PD patients carrying GBA mutations show intraneuronal accumulation of alpha-synuclein ( \u03b1-syn ) called Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites , which are the pathological hallmarks of sporadic PD[3] . Several cellular , animal , and postmortem studies have indicated an association between GBA mutations and \u03b1-syn accumulation . For example , deficiency in GCase enzymatic activity causes lysosomal dysfunction and \u03b1-syn accumulation[8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12] . Increased \u03b1-syn in turn creates a vicious cycle by inhibiting the trafficking of GCase to lysosomes , thus leading to decreased GCase activity in lysosomes[9] . Consistent with this notion , mouse models overexpressing \u03b1-syn and postmortem tissue from patients with PD show reduced GCase activity in the brains[13 , 14 , 15] . Although several hypotheses have been proposed , further mechanisms of how GBA mutations contribute to the development of PD remain elusive . Medaka ( Oryzias latipes ) are a versatile vertebrate animal model for disease research . These fish are easy to handle , have a relatively short generation time ( 2\u20133 months ) , produce a large number of progeny per generation , and have several inbred strains[16] . Importantly , medaka have an advantage as an animal model of PD due to endogenous \u03b1-syn in contrast to invertebrate models that lack \u03b1-syn . Moreover , several genetic manipulations can be performed in medaka in addition to established transgenic techniques[17 , 18 , 19 , 20 , 21] . So far , we have reported genetic PD models of medaka that develop locomotor dysfunction accompanied by the selective loss of dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurons[22 , 23] . Considering these lines of evidence , medaka have the potential to be a new animal model of PD . Here , we generated GBA nonsense mutant medaka and found that homozygous GBA nonsense mutant ( GBA-/- ) medaka are a viable neuronopathic GD model . GBA-/- medaka developed remarkable \u03b1-syn accumulation in the brains and thus provide novel insights into the association of GBA mutations with \u03b1-syn accumulation . Furthermore , we revealed minimal contribution of endogenous \u03b1-syn to the pathogenesis of neuronopathic GD in medaka . \n We generated GBA nonsense mutant medaka to investigate the mechanisms by which GBA mutation leads to PD . To identify medaka GBA orthologs , we searched the medaka genome database ( http://www . ensembl . org/Oryzias_latipes/Info/Index ) with the basic local alignment search tool and found only one ortholog of human GBA . We cloned the medaka GBA with reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) and rapid amplification of cDNA ends and found that this gene has 11 exons encoding a protein of 522 amino acids . The amino acid sequence of medaka GBA showed 53% homology to that of human GBA ( S1 Fig ) . Next , we screened a targeting-induced local lesions in genome ( TILLING ) library for medaka GBA using a high-resolution melting assay[17 , 24] . We identified a nonsense mutant ( W337X ) and generated the nonsense mutant medaka by in vitro fertilization ( Fig . 1A ) . We examined GCase activity in the brains of GBA mutants after crossing with heterozygous mutants . GBAW337X/W337X ( GBA-/- ) medaka showed complete deficiency in GCase activity , and GBAWT/W337X ( GBA+/- ) medaka showed a decrease in GCase activity of about 50% compared to wild-type ( GBA+/+ ) medaka ( Fig . 1B ) . Although humans and mice lacking GCase activity die soon after birth[4 , 25 , 26] , GBA-/- medaka survived for more than 3 months , enabling us to analyze the pathological progression ( Fig . 1D ) . GBA-/- medaka showed abnormal rotating swimming movement at 2 months ( S1 , S2 Movie ) and the abnormal appearance of a bent spine at 3 months ( Fig . 1C ) . High levels of glucocerebroside accumulated in the brains of GBA-/- medaka ( Fig . 1E ) , whereas the amount of galactocerebroside , an isomer of glucocerebroside , was not changed . Glucocerebroside with C18 fatty acids was the most dominant type in the brains of GBA-/- medaka ( S2 Fig ) , an observation that is consistent with the neuronopathic GD mouse model[27] . We performed pathological analyses of GBA-/- medaka . Patients with GD show Periodic acid-Schiff-positive Gaucher cells in affected visceral organs such as the liver , spleen , and bone marrow , whereas GBA-/- medaka showed abnormal Periodic acid-Schiff-positive cells in the spleen and kidney , but not in the liver , at 3 months ( S3 Fig ) . Next , we examined the brains of GBA-/- medaka and found abnormal cells with large vacuoles mainly in the periventricular gray zone of the optic tectum ( Fig . 2A , B ) . Transmission electron microscopy revealed that these cells were macrophage-like and had large vacuoles containing filamentous structures ( Fig . 2C ) . Similar filamentous structures are observed in Gaucher cells of patients with GD and mouse models of GD[26 , 28 , 29] . The staining intensity with Luxol fast blue was decreased , and single-stranded DNA ( ssDNA ) -positive cells were observed in GBA-/- medaka ( Fig . 2D ) , indicating myelin loss and cell death , respectively . In situ hybridization for apolipoprotein E ( APOE ) , a microglial marker in teleost fish[30] , revealed proliferating activated microglia in GBA-/- medaka ( Fig . 2D ) . Teleost fish have glial fibrillary acidic protein ( GFAP ) -expressing radial glial cells ( or ependymoglial cells ) instead of astrocytes as in mammals[31] . Humans and mice with neuronopathic GD show astrogliosis in their brains[3 , 32] , whereas neither proliferation of GFAP-positive radial glial cells nor elevated levels of GFAP were observed in GBA-/- medaka ( Fig . 2D , E ) . To investigate the type of neuronal cells that die in GBA-/- medaka , we counted the numbers of tyrosine hydroxylase ( TH ) -positive dopaminergic neurons in the middle diencephalon , which corresponds to the human substantia nigra[33] , TH-positive noradrenergic neurons in the locus coeruleus , and tryptophan hydroxylase ( TPH ) -positive serotonergic neurons in the superior raphe at 2 and 3 months . GBA-/- medaka showed progressive cell loss of all these neurons ( Fig . 2F ) . Consistent with these findings , the amount of TH was decreased in GBA-/- medaka ( Fig . 2G ) . Collectively , GBA-/- medaka exhibited neuronopathic GD-like pathology including progressive and non-selective neuronal loss . Medaka express \u03b1-syn , which is a protein consisting of 127 amino acids . To investigate \u03b1-syn pathology in GBA-/- medaka , we created a medaka \u03b1-syn antibody against the epitope of amino acids 90 to 104 ( S4A Fig ) . Medaka also express \u03b2-synuclein , \u03b3-synuclein-a , and \u03b3-synuclein-b in addition to \u03b1-syn , but these other synucleins do not have amino acid sequences homologous to the epitope of the medaka \u03b1-syn antibody ( S4B Fig ) . Next , we generated \u03b1-syn deletion mutant medaka using TALENs . Deletion of 11 bases near the start codon in \u03b1-syn resulted in a frame shift mutation ( S4C Fig ) . Wild-type , heterozygous , and homozygous \u03b1-syn deletion mutant ( \u03b1-syn+/+ , \u03b1-syn+/- , and \u03b1-syn-/- , respectively ) medaka could be distinguished with PCR analysis of \u03b1-syn ( S4D Fig ) . RT-PCR analysis of \u03b1-syn mRNA revealed that \u03b1-syn-/- medaka did not express intact \u03b1-syn mRNA ( S4E Fig ) . Western blot analysis with the medaka \u03b1-syn antibody revealed a 14-kDa band , which was specifically found in \u03b1-syn+/+ medaka ( S4F Fig ) . The authenticity of the antibody was confirmed by the lack of immunostaining with the medaka \u03b1-syn antibody in the brains of \u03b1-syn-/- medaka ( S4G Fig ) . Consistent with the findings in mammals , medaka \u03b1-syn was mainly found presynaptically with immunoelectron microscopy ( S4H Fig ) . Then , we performed immunohistochemical analysis and found abundant \u03b1-syn accumulation in the brains of GBA-/- medaka at 3 months ( Fig . 3A ) . \u03b1-syn accumulation was also observed at 2 months , but not at 1 month ( S5 Fig ) . Abnormal structures observed with toluidine blue staining were similar to \u03b1-syn accumulations in size and distribution ( Fig . 3A ) . Transmission electron microscopy revealed numerous axonal swellings containing vacuoles and other various materials in the brains of GBA-/- medaka ( Figs . 3B , S6A ) . A considerable number of these vacuoles had double membranes and sometimes contained mitochondria , suggesting that these vacuoles were autophagosomes . Consistent with this , LC3 , an autophagosomal marker , accumulated in the brains of GBA-/- medaka ( Fig . 3A ) . Moreover , immunogold-labeled \u03b1-syn was detected in axonal swellings with immunoelectron microscopy ( Fig . 3C ) . Conventional and confocal double immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that accumulated \u03b1-syn colocalized with LC3 accumulations ( Fig . 3D ) , and a considerable portion of the \u03b1-syn signals in axonal swellings colocalized with LC3 signals ( Figs . 3E , S6B ) . In addition to these findings , ubiquitin also accumulated in \u03b1-syn-positive axonal swellings ( Figs . 3E , S6B ) . To examine the \u03b1-syn expression level and solubility , we performed sequential biochemical fractionation assays . The total amount of \u03b1-syn in the Triton-soluble fraction was not increased in GBA-/- medaka . However , when adjusted for the amount of neuron-specific enolase ( NSE ) and considering the robust neuronal loss in GBA-/- medaka , \u03b1-syn was significantly increased in GBA-/- medaka ( Fig . 3F ) . The decreased amount of neurofilament also reflected the neuronal loss in GBA-/- medaka ( Fig . 3F ) . No apparent \u03b1-syn band was detected in the Triton-insoluble , SDS-soluble fraction in all genotypes . In agreement with the accumulation of autophagosomes in axonal swellings , the ratio of LC3-II to LC3-I was increased in GBA-/- medaka ( Fig . 3F ) . Meanwhile , we also investigated the phenotypes of GBA+/- medaka because heterozygous mutations in GBA are a strong risk for PD[5 , 6] . However , GBA+/- medaka even at 12 months did not show any apparent abnormal phenotypes including \u03b1-syn pathology , the numbers of TH-positive neurons , swimming movement , or the amounts of several neurotransmitters ( S7A\u2013S7E Fig ) . Previous studies of GD mouse models reported that p62/SQSTM1 ( an autophagic substrate ) accumulates in neurons and astrocytes[34] , and the number of Cathepsin D-positive puncta is decreased in neurons[35] . These observations prompted us to examine the autophagy-lysosome pathway in GBA-/- medaka . Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that ubiquitin- and p62-positive aggregates were observed mainly in the perikarya of neurons ( Figs . 4A , D , S8B ) . These aggregates were observed only in neurons and not in GFAP-positive radial glial cells or Lycopersicon Esculentum ( Tomato ) Lectin ( LEL ) -positive microglia ( S8A Fig ) . LEL is an excellent teleost microglial marker[36] . Western blot analysis showed that the amounts of ubiquitin and p62 were increased in the brains of GBA-/- medaka ( Fig . 4C ) . In contrast , these aggregates did not colocalize with LC3 accumulations or Cathepsin D-positive organelles ( Figs . 4D , S8B ) . These organelles , which are putative lysosomes , showed decreased Cathepsin D staining intensity and abnormal morphology ( Fig . 4A ) . Consistent with this , neurons that contained lysosome-like organelles filled with filamentous structures were observed with transmission electron microscopy ( Fig . 4B ) . GBA nonsense mutant medaka have random point mutations in the genome at loci other than GBA . Therefore , we performed a rescue experiment to determine whether the abnormal phenotypes observed in GBA-/- medaka were really caused by GBA mutation . We created medaka GBA-expressing vectors driven by a medaka growth-associated protein 43 ( GAP-43 ) promoter ( S9A Fig ) [37] . GAP-43 mRNA is expressed mainly in nervous system in medaka[37] . We established six medaka GBA transgenic lines ( Tg ( GAP-43:GBA ) ) using these vectors and crossed them with GBA nonsense mutant medaka . Each line of GBA-/- medaka with GBA transgene ( Tg ( GAP-43:GBA ) ;GBA-/- ) showed GCase activity of various levels in the brains at 3 months ( S9B Fig ) . All lines of Tg ( GAP-43:GBA ) ;GBA-/- medaka showed normal swimming movement at 2 months ( S3 Movie ) . Also , the swimming distance was increased in Tg ( GAP-43:GBA ) line3;GBA-/- medaka ( S9C Fig ) . Pathological analysis of the brains of Tg ( GAP-43:GBA ) line3;GBA-/- medaka including hematoxylin and eosin staining , in situ hybridization for APOE , and immunohistochemistry for p62 and \u03b1-syn revealed no apparent abnormality ( S9D Fig ) . We concluded that the abnormal phenotypes observed in the brains of GBA-/- medaka were caused by the GBA mutation . Many studies have reported that accumulated \u03b1-syn caused by \u03b1-syn overexpression results in neurotoxicity[38] . Neuroinflammation is observed in the brains of patients with PD , and much evidence shows that neuroinflammation promotes disease progression[39] . Moreover , a recent study reported that oligomeric \u03b1-syn released from neurons activates inflammatory responses in microglia[40] . We examined the toxicity of \u03b1-syn in GBA-/- medaka by crossing GBA nonsense mutant medaka with \u03b1-syn deletion mutant medaka . \u03b1-syn-/- medaka showed no apparent abnormal phenotypes in their outer appearance , swimming movement , or life span like \u03b1-syn-disrupted mice[41] . The life spans of GBA-/-\u03b1-syn+/- and GBA-/-\u03b1-syn-/- medaka were not prolonged compared to that of GBA-/-\u03b1-syn+/+ medaka ( Fig . 5A ) . Moreover , the number of LC3-positive puncta was not changed in GBA-/-\u03b1-syn-/- medaka , indicating that \u03b1-syn was not primarily involved in formation of axonal swellings ( Fig . 5B ) . The numbers of dopaminergic neurons in the middle diencephalon and noradrenergic neurons in the locus coeruleus were not changed in either GBA-/- \u03b1-syn+/- or GBA-/- \u03b1-syn-/- medaka ( Fig . 5C ) . We also examined the extent of neuroinflammation with in situ hybridization for APOE and quantitative RT-PCR for tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) \u03b1 mRNA . The number of APOE-positive cells and the expression level of TNF\u03b1 were not changed ( Fig . 5D , E ) . Collectively , we found no evidence for \u03b1-syn involvement in the short life span , formation of axonal swellings , dopaminergic and noradrenergic neuronal loss , and neuroinflammation that are observed in GBA -/- medaka . \n To date , several genetic animal models of neuronopathic GD including mouse , dog , and sheep have been reported[42] . Gba null mice die within 24 hours of birth due to permeability barrier defects in the skin[26 , 43] . Thus , conditional knockout K14-lnl/lnl mice with normal GCase activity in their skin were generated[27] . However , use of these mice is limited because they survive only 2 weeks after birth . Mice harboring a Gba missense mutation combined with prosaposin- or saposin C-deficient mice , another neuronopathic GD model , also show neuronopathic abnormalities[29 , 34] and have the advantage of longer survival than K14-lnl/lnl mice . However , the relevance of these mice to neuronopathic GD is controversial . The present study revealed that GBA-/- medaka survive long enough for pathological analysis of disease progression . As an example , GBA-/- medaka showed \u03b1-syn accumulation at 2 months , not at 1 month after fertilization . Considering these observations , GBA-/- medaka are useful as a viable neuronopathic GD model with endogenous \u03b1-syn accumulation . GBA-/- medaka showed several phenotypes different from those of mammalian neuronopathic GD model . Firstly , the skin of GBA-/- medaka looks intact whereas severe skin lesion is observed in patients with perinatal lethal type GD and Gba null mice[4 , 43] . Secondly , GBA-/- medaka exhibited PAS-positive abnormal cells in spleen and kidney which presumably correspond to human Gaucher cells . In patients with GD , Gaucher cells are not found in kidney , but in liver , spleen and bone marrow . These differences could be explained by the fact that in adult teleost fish kidney has hematopoietic function instead of mammalian bone marrow[44] . Lastly , the proliferation of GFAP-positive radial glial cells was not observed in GBA-/- medaka whereas astrogliosis is observed in humans and mice with neuronopathic GD . It was reported that the reaction of GFAP-positive radial glial cells to inflammation is different from that of mammalian astrocytes[31] . Lysosomes play a fundamental role in the autophagic pathway by fusing with autophagosomes and digesting their contents[45] . In general , lysosomal dysfunction results in defective digestion and accumulation of autophagic substrates such as polyubiquitinated proteins , p62 , and dysfunctional mitochondria , accompanied by accumulation of autophagosomes . Axonal swellings containing autophagosome-like structures are observed in mouse models of lysosomal storage diseases such as neuronopathic GD mice , Niemann-pick type C1 mice , Cathepsin D-deficient mice , and Cathepsin B/L double-deficient mice[34 , 46 , 47] . A previous study reported that autophagosomes are formed in the distal part of the axon and undergo retrograde transport toward the cell body[48] . Another previous study demonstrated that inhibition of lysosomal function in primary neurons from mouse embryos disrupts the axonal transport of autophagosomes and causes their accumulation in axons[49] . Considering these lines of evidence , we propose that GCase deficiency primarily causes lysosomal dysfunction , leading to disrupted retrograde transport of autophagosomes in axons and formation of axonal swellings with \u03b1-syn accumulation ( Fig . 6 ) . Contrary to our expectations , p62-positive aggregates did not colocalize with LC3- and \u03b1-syn-positive axonal swellings , but were mainly located in the perikarya of neurons . These results suggest the possibility that presynaptic \u03b1-syn is transported proximally and degraded in a p62-independent autophagy-lysosome pathway . A previous study supports this hypothesis . Conditional knockout mice lacking ATG7 in TH-positive neurons show \u03b1-syn aggregates in swollen axons in the striatum , but not in cell bodies in the midbrain , indicating that autophagic dysfunction initially causes \u03b1-syn aggregates in the distal part of axons[50] . In addition , another previous study demonstrated that \u03b1-syn aggregation occurs earlier in axons than in neuronal cell bodies in the cardiac sympathetic nervous system in PD patients[51] . Because axonal retrograde transport may be involved in the degradative pathway of \u03b1-syn and may be a therapeutic target in PD , further studies are required to elucidate the precise mechanisms . Because GBA+/- medaka as old as 12 months did not show any apparent abnormal phenotypes , we could not directly investigate how heterozygous GBA mutations cause PD . Meanwhile , according to a recent report , induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons from PD patients carrying heterozygous GBA mutations show \u03b1-syn accumulation , an impaired autophagy-lysosome pathway , and dysregulation of calcium homeostasis[12] . The reason for differences in phenotypes between in vivo and in vitro models is unclear . However , our findings from GBA+/- medaka seem to be reasonable because the penetrance of PD in GBA mutation carriers is estimated to be at most 30% by the age of 80 years[52] . Thus , second hits such as environmental factors and other genetic factors are probably required for the development of PD pathology in vivo . Cellular and animal PD models overexpressing \u03b1-syn have provided evidence for the various potential toxic mechanisms of \u03b1-syn . However , few studies have demonstrated the pathological role of endogenous \u03b1-syn in vivo , which may reflect the authentic role for \u03b1-syn in PD . A previous study showed that \u03b1-syn null mice are resistant to 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1 , 2 , 3 , 6-tetrahydropyridine ( MPTP ) toxicity compared with wild-type mice[53] . However , it is unclear whether this improvement is due to attenuation of \u03b1-syn toxicity or \u03b1-syn-mediated changes in the presynaptic machinery . Another previous study showed that the formation of intraneuronal inclusions and neurodegeneration in 26S proteasome-depleted mice is independent of \u03b1-syn[54] . In the present study , disruption of \u03b1-syn did not improve the life span , neuronal loss , or neuroinflammation in GBA-/- medaka . Moreover , \u03b1-syn was not involved in the accumulation of autophagosomes in axons . Our data indicate that \u03b1-syn accumulation is a downstream event , and other severe pathological factors may obscure the involvement of \u03b1-syn in the pathogenesis of neuronopathic GD in medaka . In summary , the present study showed that GBA-/- medaka are useful as a viable neuronopathic GD model with endogenous \u03b1-syn accumulation . Long-term survival of these fish allows us to observe the pathological progression . Our data revealed that GCase deficiency causes lysosomal dysfunction in neurons and \u03b1-syn accumulation in axonal swellings containing autophagosomes . Axonal transport of \u03b1-syn may play an important role in the mechanisms of GBA mutations leading to PD and may also be a therapeutic target in PD . Furthermore , we demonstrate the minimal contribution of \u03b1-syn to the pathogenesis of neuronopathic GD in medaka . GBA-/- medaka represent a valuable model for exploring the pathological mechanisms and also provide a new platform for developing treatments in PD with GBA mutations as well as neuronopathic GD . \n Medaka were anesthetized in 0 . 02% tricaine in fish water and then sacrificed . All experimental procedures used in this study followed national guidelines . The Animal Research Committee of Kyoto University granted a formal waiver of ethical approval and also granted permission . Medaka of the Kyoto-cab strain , a substrain of Cab , were maintained at 27\u00b0C in a recirculating aquaculture system . Adult fish were kept in a reproduction regimen ( 14 hr light/10 hr dark ) . Eggs were kept in a dark box at 28\u00b0C . RNA was extracted from wild-type medaka brains with Qiazol ( QIAGEN ) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions . cDNA was synthesized using the PrimeScript RT reagent kit ( Perfect Real Time ) ( TaKaRa , #RR037A ) . To identify medaka GBA , SNCA , SNCGb , p62/SQSTM1 , and MAP1LC3B orthologs , we referred to the medaka genome database ( http://www . ensembl . org/Oryzias_latipes/Info/Index ) . Because their cDNA sequences and amino acid sequences were not completely known , we determined their cDNA sequences using a combination of RT-PCR and rapid amplification of cDNA ends , the products of which were generated using Seegene\u2019s Capfishing kit ( Seegene ) . The cDNA sequences can be found in the European Nucleotide Archive ( ENA , accession numbers LM644999\u2013645003 ) . GBA mutant medaka were generated as described[17] . To find GBA mutations in the TILLING library , we narrowed down mutated candidates from 5 , 771 samples using a high-resolution melting assay , followed by determination of the DNA sequences[24] . We screened the TILLING library for exons 1\u20132 , exons 5\u20137 , exon 8 , and exons 9\u201311 of GBA . In vitro fertilization was carried out using sperm from a sample with the favorable mutation . To genotype the progeny of GBAWT/W337X mutants , PCR was performed with the following primer set ( 5\u2032-AGGGTTGAAGGGGTTAAGCA-3\u2032 , 5\u2032-TTGTAACCAGTACCGCAGCA-3\u2032 ) , designed HybProbes ( 5\u2032-LC Red 640-CATGTACCAGTGGACG-Phosphate-3\u2032 , 5\u2032-CCTAAGCTTATATCTGCAGGGACTAAACTGT-Fluorescein-3\u2032 ) , and LightCycler 480 Probes Master in LightCycler 480 ( Roche ) according to the manufacturer's instructions . The genotypes can be distinguished with high-resolution melting curve analysis . GBAWT/W337X mutants were back-crossed to Kyoto-Cab medaka at least seven times and then crossed to obtain GBAW337X/W337X mutants . For the rescue experiment , we established GBA transgenic medaka in which medaka GBA expression was driven by the medaka GAP-43 promoter ( Tg ( GAP-43:GBA ) ) . We used an insulator located in the upstream region of sea urchin ( Hemicentrotus pulcherrimus ) arylsulfatase[55 , 56] . The transgenic construct was flanked by two insulators and included the medaka GAP-43 promoter followed by an internal ribosome entry site ( IRES ) , enhanced GFP ( EGFP ) , and the Simian virus 40 polyadenylation site or the medaka \u03b2-actin 3\u2032-untranslated region ( 3\u2032UTR ) ( S8A Fig ) . The medaka GAP-43 promoter contained a 1 . 0-kb fragment of the 5\u2032-flanking region of the gene . A DNA fragment of the transgene was inserted into EcoR I/Sal I restriction enzyme sites of the pDs-actb2k-EGFP plasmid . pDs-actb2k-EGFP was constructed by inserting an Xho I/Spe I fragment from pactb2k-EGFP into the Xho I/Spe I site of the pDs-GTDEL4 plasmid , which contains 5\u2032- and 3\u2032-Ds sequences[21 , 57] . The resultant vector was injected into the cytoplasm of fertilized Kyoto-Cab eggs before the first cleavage as described[20] . \u03b1-syn deletion mutant medaka were generated with TALENs as described[58] . To genotype the progeny of \u03b1-syn deletion mutants , PCR was performed with the following primer set ( 5\u2032-GATCCCGAGCCATCCAC-3\u2032 , 5\u2032-TGCAACTGTGGAAACACCAT-3\u2032 ) , followed by electrophoresis in a 10% ( w/v ) polyacrylamide gel ( S4D Fig ) . RT-PCR for \u03b1-syn was performed with the following primer sets ( \u03b1-syn: 5\u2032-GATCCCGAGCCATCCAC-3\u2032 , 5\u2032-TTTGGAGAAACCCTTCATTAAC-3\u2032; \u03b2-actin: 5\u2032-TCCACCTTCCAGCAGATGTG-3\u2032 , 5\u2032-AGCATTTGCGGTGGACGAT-3\u2032 ) ( S4E Fig ) . The spontaneous swimming movement of medaka was traced using a video camera positioned above the water tank and analyzed with ethovision XT 5 ( Noldus ) . The water tank was a transparent circular container ( 20 cm diameter , 2 cm water depth , room temperature ) . Image acquisition began 5 min after medaka were placed in a new water tank . Data were collected continuously for the subsequent 3 min . The assay for GCase enzymatic activity was performed as described[11] . Medaka brains were homogenized in 40 \u03bcl sample buffer ( 10 mM Tris-HCl , 150 mM NaCl , 1% ( v/v ) Triton X-100 , pH 7 . 4 ) , sonicated , and centrifuged at 10 , 000 \u00d7g at 4\u00b0C for 5 min . Aliquots containing 50 \u03bcg protein were incubated in assay buffer ( 5 mM 4-Methylumbelliferyl \u03b2-d-glucopyranoside ( Wako , #324\u201337441 ) , 1% ( w/v ) sodium taurocholate ( Wako , #197\u201310033 ) , 50 mM sodium citrate , 50 mM sodium phosphate , pH 5 . 0 ) in the presence or absence of 2 mM Conduritol B epoxide ( Toronto Research Chemicals , #C666000 ) in a total volume of 100 \u03bcl at 37\u00b0C for 4 hr . The reaction was stopped by adding 100 \u03bcl of 0 . 4 M glycine , pH 10 . 8 , and the fluorescence at 460 nm ( emission 355 nm ) was measured with Fluoroskan Ascent FL ( Thermo Fisher ) . Medaka brains were stored at\u201480\u00b0C until analyses and homogenized in 1 ml tissue homogenization buffer ( 250 mM sucrose , 25 mM KCl , 50 mM Tris-HCl , 0 . 5 mM EDTA , pH 7 . 4 ) . Aliquots containing 1 mg protein were used for the analyses . Levels of glucocerebroside and galactocerebroside were measured with high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem MS as described with modification using SFC separation[59] . A synthetic peptide corresponding to amino acids 90\u2013104 of medaka \u03b1-syn conjugated to Keyhole Limpet Hemocyanin was used for immunization of rabbits . Serum was obtained 49 days after immunization and purified with affinity chromatography . Frozen and paraffin sections were used for immunohistochemical analyses . For frozen sections , medaka brains were fixed with 4% ( w/v ) paraformaldehyde ( PFA ) in phosphate-buffered saline ( PBS ) at 4\u00b0C for 4 hr and then placed in 30% ( w/v ) sucrose at 4\u00b0C for more than 16 hr .

The sections were incubated at 4\u00b0C with primary antibodies or lectin for 1 to 3 days and then processed for visualization . As secondary antibodies , ImmPRESS ( VECTOR ) was used for diaminobenzidine staining , and Alexa Fluor-conjugated antibodies ( Molecular Probes ) were used for immunofluorescence .

RNA was extracted from medaka brains with Qiazol ( QIAGEN ) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions . cDNA was generated with reverse transcription using the PrimeScript RT reagent kit ( Perfect Real Time ) ( TaKaRa , #RR037A ) . The amount of cDNA was quantified with real-time PCR using LightCycler 480 SYBR Green I Master ( Roche , #04887352001 ) and Roche LightCycler 480 . The following primer sets were used ( TNF\u03b1: 5\u2032-ATTGGAGTGAAAGGCCAGAA-3\u2032 , 5\u2032-ACTAATTTGAGACCGCCACG-3\u2032; \u03b2-actin: 5\u2032-TCCACCTTCCAGCAGATGTG-3\u2032 , 5\u2032-AGCATTTGCGGTGGACGAT-3\u2032 ) . The vector including a portion of the medaka APOE cDNA sequence was generously provided by Dr . H . Mitani ( Tokyo University , Tokyo , Japan ) ( in submission ) . In situ hybridization was performed as described[60] . Counterstaining was performed with methyl green ( Sigma-Aldrich , #M8884 ) . For Triton-soluble fractions , samples were homogenized in high-salt buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 ( 750 mM NaCl , 5 mM EDTA , 50 mM Tris-HCl , 1% ( v/v ) Triton X-100 , pH 7 . 5 ) and centrifuged at 20 , 400 \u00d7g at 4\u00b0C for 5 min . For SDS-soluble fractions , the pellet was subsequently sonicated in SDS buffer ( 50 mM Tris-HCl , 2% SDS , pH 7 . 4 ) followed by centrifugation at 20 , 400 \u00d7g at 4\u00b0C for 5 min . The supernatant was boiled in sample buffer ( 1% ( w/v ) SDS , 12 . 5% ( w/v ) glycerol , 0 . 005% ( w/v ) bromophenol blue , 2 . 5% ( v/v ) 2-mercaptoethanol , 25 mM Tris-HCl , pH 6 . 8 ) . Samples were separated on 10% , 12% , or 14% ( w/v ) gels for SDS-PAGE . Samples containing 20 \u03bcg protein were loaded in each lane for Triton-soluble fractions , and SDS-soluble fractions were loaded according to the amount of protein in Triton-soluble fractions . Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes with a Trans-Blot SD Semi-Dry Transfer Cell ( Bio-Rad ) . For detection of medaka \u03b1-syn and mouse \u03b1-syn , the membranes were treated with 0 . 4% ( w/v ) PFA in PBS for 30 min at room temperature before blocking to prevent detachment of \u03b1-syn from the blotted membranes[61] . For western blot analyses , the following primary antibodies were used: anti-\u03b2-actin ( Sigma-Aldrich , #A1978 , 1:5000 ) , anti-GFAP ( Sigma-Aldrich , #G3893 , 1:1000 ) , anti-LC3 ( MBL , #PM036 , 1:2000 ) , anti-NSE ( DAKO , #M0873 , 1:500 ) , anti-\u03b1-syn ( BD Transduction , #610787 , 1:2000 ) , anti-medaka \u03b1-syn ( 1:10 , 000 ) , anti-phosphorylated neurofilament ( COVANCE , #smi-31r , 1:1000 ) , anti-p62 ( MBL , #PM045 , 1:500 ) , anti-TH ( Millipore , #MAB318 , 1:1000 ) , and anti-ubiquitin ( Santa Cruz , #sc-8017 , 1:50 ) .

{"lay_summary": "Little is understood about how the immune system distinguishes between pathogenic and non-pathogenic microbes . Limiting or preventing infections by intracellular pathogens requires the activation of innate immunity and the consequent generation of effector and memory T cells , which recognize and kill infected cells . Investigators are currently testing attenuated versions of pathogenic microbes as vaccines in an attempt to generate pathogen-specific T cells without causing disease . Unfortunately , attenuated microbes often fail to elicit long-lived protective immunity . We hypothesized that attenuated bacterial vaccines do not immunize because they fail to activate a stimulatory arm of host innate immune receptors . However , we found that these attenuated bacterial vaccines are not simply prevented from activating immunity , but rather generate a negative signal that inhibits the desired immune response . These studies may explain why the addition of an adjuvant to ineffective vaccines does not necessarily improve immunogenicity . Furthermore , these studies provide a framework for the development of attenuated vaccines that do not inhibit the desired immune responses .", "article": "Listeria monocytogenes is a facultative intracellular pathogen capable of inducing a robust cell-mediated immune response to sub-lethal infection . The capacity of L . monocytogenes to escape from the phagosome and enter the host cell cytosol is paramount for the induction of long-lived CD8 T cell\u2013mediated protective immunity . Here , we show that the impaired T cell response to L . monocytogenes confined within a phagosome is not merely a consequence of inefficient antigen presentation , but is the result of direct suppression of the adaptive response . This suppression limited not only the adaptive response to vacuole-confined L . monocytogenes , but negated the response to bacteria within the cytosol . Co-infection with phagosome-confined and cytosolic L . monocytogenes prevented the generation of acquired immunity and limited expansion of antigen-specific T cells relative to the cytosolic L . monocytogenes strain alone . Bacteria confined to a phagosome suppressed the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and led to the rapid MyD88-dependent production of IL-10 . Blockade of the IL-10 receptor or the absence of MyD88 during primary infection restored protective immunity . Our studies demonstrate that the presence of microbes within a phagosome can directly impact the innate and adaptive immune response by antagonizing the signaling pathways necessary for inflammation and the generation of protective CD8 T cells . \n The intracellular bacterium L . monocytogenes has been studied for decades as a model of innate and cellular immunity [1] . Infection with L . monocytogenes leads to a robust innate and adaptive response , characterized by the generation of long-lived antigen-specific CD4 and CD8 T cells [2] , the latter of which are predominantly responsible for protective immunity [3] , [4] . Following engulfment by the host cell , L . monocytogenes escapes from the phagosome and into the host cell cytosol via secretion of the pore-forming cytolysin , listeriolysin O ( LLO ) [5] . Once within the cytosol , the bacteria express ActA that facilitates cell to cell spread via polymerization of host-cell actin [6] . ActA-deficient mutants still induce protective immunity , while mutants lacking LLO ( sometimes designated as \u0394hly ) elicit an antigen-specific T cell response , but these T cells are unable to provide protective immunity [7] , [8] . Escape of L . monocytogenes into the cytosol permits bacterial growth and facilitates the MyD88-independent activation of a cytosolic surveillance pathway , leading to the production of a unique array of cytokines , including type I IFN [9]\u2013[12] . What remains unclear is why L . monocytogenes , which contains ligands for multiple Toll-like receptors found on the cell surface and within the phagosome , only elicits effective adaptive immunity when entering the host cell cytosol [13] , [14] . Innate immune recognition of L . monocytogenes is critical for controlling early microbial replication [2] . Interaction of the bacterium with host pattern recognition receptors ( PRR ) triggers a cascade of cytokines and chemokines that both recruits and arms innate immune effectors [15] , [16] . L . monocytogenes contains ligands for TLR2 ( peptidoglycan , lipotechoic acid and lipoproteins ) , TLR5 ( flagellin ) , TLR9 ( CpG motifs ) , and NOD2 ( muramyl dipeptide ) , all of which may elicit proinflammatory cytokine secretion [17]\u2013[22] . Rapid secretion of chemokines such as MCP-1 and MCP-3 , and cytokines such as IFN-\u03b3 and TNF are essential for enhancing the recruitment and bacteriocidal functions of macrophages and neutrophils , which act to restrict bacterial burden prior to the onset of the adaptive response [23]\u2013[25] . Typically suppressive cytokines such as IL-10 are also elicited in response to L . monocytogenes infection where they may contribute to bacterial persistence as well as T cell potency [26]\u2013[28] . The innate response to these PRR-ligands also serves to shape the ensuing adaptive immune response [29] . Innate inflammatory cytokines produced in response to L . monocytogenes infection facilitate dendritic cell ( DC ) maturation and migration to the infection-associated secondary lymphatics [29] , [30] . Maturation is essential for enhancing the stimulatory capacity of the DC via upregulation of costimulatory surface molecules and cytokines ( e . g . CD80/86 , CD70 , IL-12p70 , IL-18 , IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 ) [31] . Maturation also facilitates migration of the DC into the draining lymph node where it can interact with large numbers of na\u00efve T cells [32] . Together , the local cytokine milieu and dendritic cell maturation state significantly contribute to the outcome of the DC-T cell interaction and ultimately , the potency of the T cell response [33] . We questioned how the response to a bacterium confined within a phagosome would impact the adaptive response to a bacterium within the host cell cytosol . Mice were infected with two distinct strains of L . monocytogenes . The first strain , ActA-Lm , escapes into the host cell cytosol and elicits long-lived CD8 T cell-dependent protective immunity [23] , [34] . Because it cannot spread between cells , ActA-Lm is highly attenuated in vivo , can be administered at a higher dose , and is rapidly cleared from both liver and spleen ( relative to wild-type L . monocytogenes ) . A second strain , LLO-Lm , is unable to produce listeriolysin O ( LLO ) , and thus cannot escape from the phagosome [35] . Importantly , infection with LLO-Lm elicits CD8 T cells , but little or no protective immunity to a lethal wild-type L . monocytogenes challenge [7] , [8] . To facilitate enumeration of L . monocytogenes-specific CD8 and CD4 T cell responses following infection , we used strains expressing chicken ovalbumin ( OVA ) fused to a non-lytic fragment of LLO . \n To better understand the impact of phagosome-confined bacteria on the adaptive immune response we infected cohorts of mice with an identical dose of ActA-Lm-OVA ( 1\u00d7105 colony forming units ( CFU ) ) , a dose sufficient to elicit long-lived CD8 T cell-mediated protective immunity . To this inoculum , we added increasing numbers of phagosome-confined LLO-Lm-OVA . We assessed protective immunity 60 days later by challenging with wild-type-L . monocytogenes-OVA , and then enumerating CFU in the spleen ( Figure 1A ) . Strikingly , the protective immunity typically elicited by ActA-Lm-OVA was compromised by the presence of phagosome-confined LLO-Lm-OVA during primary infection . In other words , despite a significant increase in antigen during primary infection , the adaptive response to the cytosolic bacterium was impaired by the presence of bacteria within a phagosome . A potential explanation for this finding was that the addition of LLO-Lm-OVA to the inoculum facilitated more rapid clearance of ActA-Lm-OVA , decreasing the duration of antigen presentation and negatively impacting T cell potency . To test this hypothesis , we used an erythromycin-resistant strain of ActA-Lm ( ActA-Lm-ErmR ) combined with a large number of LLO-Lm ( 1\u00d7108 CFU ) . We followed the clearance of the ActA-Lm-ErmR strain by enumerating CFU on agar containing erythromycin ( Figure 1B , C and D ) . Importantly , the addition of LLO-Lm did not impact the rate at which ActA-Lm-ErmR were cleared from the spleen or liver or the in vitro growth rate within bone marrow-derived macrophages . To determine whether the phagosome-confined bacteria required metabolic activity , heat-killed L . monocytogenes were added to an inoculum of ActA-Lm ( Figure 1E ) . Similar to our observations with LLO-Lm , the addition of HK-L . monocytogenes also limited protective immunity . In a similar fashion , the addition of the unrelated phagosome-confined non-pathogenic bacterium Bacillus subtilis also attenuated protective immunity ( Figure 1F ) . Finally , the addition of LLO-Lm-OVA to an inoculum of wt-L . monocytogenes also impaired protective immunity ( Figure 1G ) . Similar observations were made during experiments utilizing Balb/c mice ( data not shown ) . Thus , as few as 9\u00d7105 CFU of phagosome-confined LLO-Lm-OVA added to an inoculum of cytosolic ActA-Lm-OVA during primary infection leads to a greater than 1000-fold increase in CFU following wild-type challenge . Given the role of CD8 T cells in protective immunity , we questioned how the addition of increasing numbers phagosome-confined LLO-Lm-OVA would impact the primary T cell response to a constant dose of ActA-Lm-OVA . Similar to our observations following wild-type L . monocytogenes challenge , the 10 to 1000-fold increase in the number of OVA-expressing bacteria did not improve the primary T cell response . Instead , the magnitude of the primary CD8 OVA257\u2013264 and CD4 LLO190\u2013201\u2013specific response declined as the ratio of phagosome-confined to cytosolic bacteria increased ( Figure 2 ) . The frequency of OVA257\u2013264-specific CD8+ T cells determined by IFN-\u03b3 staining was confirmed using Kb-OVA257\u2013264 multimers to rule out the existence of OVA257\u2013264 -specific CD8+ T cells incapable of producing IFN-\u03b3 . To understand if suppression of the T cell response was antigen specific , we performed similar studies using LLO-Lm that did not express OVA ( Figure 3A ) . These studies demonstrated that suppression was antigen-independent , as LLO-Lm expresses neither the OVA257\u2013264 nor the LLO190\u2013201 epitopes . Furthermore , the reduced magnitude of the primary response was independent of the class I-restricting allele or the affinity of the MHC-peptide interaction as observed using L . monocytogenes strains expressing four defined vaccinia virus-derived epitopes ( Figure 3B ) [36] . Therefore , the presence of LLO-Lm within a phagosome negatively impacts both the primary CD4 and CD8 T cell response to cytosolic ActA-Lm as well as protective immunity . The innate immune response during infection plays a critical role in shaping the ensuing adaptive response . Based on the observed suppression of CD4 and CD8 T cell responses , we hypothesized that the presence of phagosome-confined L . monocytogenes altered the inflammatory cytokine response to the cytosolic ActA-Lm strain . We compared serum cytokines between mice infected with ActA-Lm-OVA alone versus in combination with increasing numbers of LLO-Lm-OVA . Infection with combinations of LLO-Lm-OVA and ActA-Lm-OVA led to the dose-dependent reduction of serum IFN-\u03b3 , IL-12p70 , IL-6 and MCP-1 relative to ActA-Lm-OVA alone ( Figure 4A ) . Thus , LLO-Lm-OVA bacteria within a phagosome exert a negative effect on the pro-inflammatory response elicited by ActA-Lm-OVA within the cytosol . Because many vacuolar pathogens elicit a Th2-type cytokine profile [37] , we questioned the ability of LLO-Lm-OVA to elicit cytokines that might limit the potency of the adaptive T cell response . Four hours post infection , serum IL-10 was detectable in mice immunized with LLO-Lm-OVA , either alone or in combination with ActA-Lm-OVA , and required the adapter protein MyD88 ( Figure 4B ) . In addition , we detected high levels of IL-12p40 in the absence of heterodimeric IL-12p70 , suggesting high levels of IL-12p40 homodimer were present in the serum ( although we cannot rule out that p40 was complexed with p19 as functional IL-23 ) . Thus , the addition of phagosome-confined LLO-Lm-OVA to an inoculum of ActA-Lm-OVA inhibits inflammatory cytokine production and corresponds with elevated levels of IL-10 . To examine the role of IL-10 in limiting the potency of the adaptive response to LLO-Lm-OVA , mice were infected with ActA-Lm-OVA and LLO-Lm-OVA in combination with an antagonist IL-10 receptor antibody ( anti-IL-10R ) [38] . This regimen permits blockade of IL-10 signalling during priming while maintaining an intact immune system during challenge . Only the highest dose of LLO-Lm-OVA was used in combination with ActA-Lm-OVA , a combination that led to the greatest suppression of inflammatory cytokines and protective immunity ( Figures 1\u20134 ) . On day 30 , mice were challenged with wild-type-L . monocytogenes-OVA and protective immunity assessed 3 days later . Impressively , mice co-infected with LLO-Lm-OVA and ActA-Lm-OVA in the presence of IL-10R blockade demonstrated equivalent protection against wt-L . monocytogenes-OVA challenge as anti-IL-10R treated mice infected with ActA-Lm-OVA alone ( Figure 5A ) . IL-10 production following LLO-Lm infection was MyD88-dependent; therefore we questioned whether LLO-Lm would limit ActA-Lm-induced protective immunity in mice lacking MyD88 . Similar to the results following IL-10R blockade , MyD88\u2212/\u2212mice immunized with the combination of ActA-Lm-OVA and LLO-Lm-OVA were protected against a lethal challenge with wt L . monocytogenes ( Figure 5B ) . Thus , in the absence of MyD88 signalling , the ability of phagosome-confined L . monocytogenes to limit the adaptive response to L . monocytogenes within the cytosol is eliminated . Together , these results demonstrate that the innate immune system discriminates between pathogens that reside in distinct subcellular locations , and via a MyD88- and IL-10-dependent mechanism , impacts the potency of the adaptive immune response . \n How the immune system differentiates between pathogenic and non-pathogenic microbes and translates this information into an appropriate immune response is not completely understood . Previous reports have shown that intracellular bacteria , including L . monocytogenes , activate a unique host cytosolic surveillance pathway of innate immunity while extracellular bacteria do not [9] , [16] , [39] , [40] . These studies led to our original hypothesis that activation of the host cytosolic surveillance pathway provided an explanation to the observations that heat-killed and LLO- L . monocytogenes fail to immunize mice to subsequent challenge [8] , [41] . Our original goal in these studies was to improve the potency of CD8 T cells responding to phagosome-confined LLO-Lm-OVA by complementing it with a cytosolic L . monocytogenes strain . Surprisingly , we found that the presence of phagosome-confined LLO-Lm negated the innate response to the cytosolic L . monocytogenes strain and ultimately compromised long-lived protective immunity ( Figure 1 ) . These results suggest that although recognition of microbial constituents within the cytosol may elicit cytokines that improve the cellular immune response , it is the exit from the phagosome that permits this inflammatory response to take place . Our data indicate that the potency of the adaptive T cell response is incrementally altered as the ratio of intracellular to phagosome-confined bacteria changes . Both ActA-Lm and LLO-Lm are similarly distributed amongst phagocytic cells in vivo [42] . Furthermore , because ActA-Lm cannot polymerize host-cell actin , neither strain will spread into neighbouring cells [43] . Thus the ratio of ActA-Lm to LLO-Lm will not alter the cell types that interact with the bacteria . To avoid overwhelming the innate immune system with L . monocytogenes , we decreased the dose of ActA-Lm to 1\u00d7105 CFU ( from the standard 0 . 1\u00d7LD50 dose of 1\u00d7107 CFU ) then added 10\u20131000-fold of LLO-Lm to the inoculum . Using these doses , the input CFU exceeded 1\u00d7107 CFU in only the highest dose group ( 1\u00d7105 CFU ActA-Lm+1\u00d7108 CFU LLO-Lm ) . Therefore , the loss of protective immunity observed following infection with 1\u00d7106 and 1\u00d7107 total CFU could not be explained by the increase in total CFU alone , as 1\u00d7107 CFU of ActA-Lm has been shown many times to elicit complete protective immunity to wild-type challenge [34] , [44] . The innate response to infection plays a pivotal role in shaping the adaptive immune response [29] . Suppression of cytokines and chemokines following recognition of microbial PRRs could impact the adaptive response via multiple mechanisms [45] . Chemokines produced at the site of infection facilitate the infiltration of neutrophils , macrophages and dendritic cells to the affected tissues [3] , [25] . Neutrophils and activated macrophages are critical for controlling bacterial replication , while dendritic cells are required for processing and presentation of microbial peptides [46] . Dendritic cells presenting bacterial antigens undergo maturation in response to proinflammatory cytokines . This maturation step is critical for modifying many aspects of dendritic cell function , including: the expression of specific proteasome subunits and thus , the repertoire of peptides available for presentation [47] , [48]; the density of MHC and co-stimulatory molecules on the cell surface [49]; and secretion of chemoattractants which recruit na\u00efve T cells into the secondary lymphatics . In addition , inflammatory cytokines can act via direct co-stimulation of T cells during priming [50] . Thus , by virtue of its inability to escape from the phagosome , LLO-Lm alters the innate inflammatory landscape and ultimately , the potency of the Listeria-specific T cell response . The impact of cytokines on T cell potency is complex , as the effect of a specific cytokine can be dependent on location , context , and concentration . In previous studies , IL-10 was necessary for optimal T cell memory following L . monocytogenes infection [28] . However , elimination of IL-10 signalling from only CD8 T cells improved the magnitude and function of the response [26] . In agreement , when mice were immunized with ActA-Lm during IL-10R blockade , a small but reproducible increase in liver and spleen cfu was observed after wild-type challenge ( Figure 5A ) . Conversely , when the IL-10 receptor was blocked during immunization with LLO-Lm-OVA , protective immunity improved , resulting in 2\u20133 logs fewer CFU following lethal challenge . While IL-10 was detectable in low , but reproducible amounts following immunization with LLO-Lm-OVA , we were unable to measure IL-10 following immunization with ActA-Lm ( Figure 3B ) . Furthermore , serum IL-10 was only consistently detectable using the highest dose of LLO-Lm , 1\u00d7108 CFU . Measuring serum IL-10 in the presence of IL-10R blockade prevents IL-10 uptake and greatly improves the sensitivity of this assay . This approach increased serum IL-10 following LLO-Lm-OVA immunization 5\u201310-fold , while IL-10 in ActA-Lm immunized mice remained undetectable ( data not shown ) . Thus , while IL-10 certainly impacts T cell potency following infection with wild-type- or ActA-Lm , its concentration is far below that measured after immunization with LLO-Lm-OVA . When assessing the role of IL-10R signalling on the suppression of memory T cell function , we chose to use the highest dose of LLO-Lm ( 1\u00d7108 CFU ) in combination with 1\u00d7105 CFU ActA-Lm . This dose combination , which provided the most consistent levels of serum IL-10 , also provided the greatest amount of suppression ( Fig 1\u20133 ) . Thus , while we demonstrated suppression of the T cell response by a 1000-fold range of LLO-Lm , the highest and most inhibitory dose was chosen to assess the dependence on IL-10R signalling . The biological activity of these low concentrations of IL-10 suggest that its effects are locally restricted , requiring only minute concentrations but within a defined location . One possibility is that as the concentration of systemic IL-10 increases , its impact on the T cell response changes from positive to negative regulator . This functional switch might be attributed to differences in sensitivity to IL-10 , or other cytokines produced within the same microenvironment . These studies suggest that during L . monocytogenes infection , IL-10 acts as a negative regulator of T cell potency in CD8 T cells , while acting as a positive regulator of cellular immunity via its effects on other cell types . The results from these studies are significant both to the fields of microbial pathogenesis and vaccinology . Understanding how microbes interact with the innate and adaptive immune system is critical for controlling their pathogenic effects . Vaccines remain one of the most cost-effective tools for preventing disease and improving health worldwide . While vaccines that elicit humoral immunity have been relatively straightforward to develop , vaccines intended to elicit robust cellular immunity , such as those needed to combat HIV and tuberculosis , have remained elusive [51] . These difficulties may be in part due to our poor understanding of how the adaptive immune response is regulated [52] . Modern approaches to developing these vaccines have used killed or attenuated forms of otherwise pathogenic organisms in hopes of eliciting the appropriate immune response without overt disease [53] . Upon observing an inadequate immune response , a common next step is to add an adjuvant to the vaccine to improve its immunogenicity , or to explain its impotence as a lack of positive inflammatory signals [54] . Our studies show that recognition of microbial products within defined cellular compartments can negate inflammation and limit the potency of the cellular immune response even when numerous proinflammatory signals are present . This result may explain why the addition of adjuvants to safe but ineffective vaccines intended to elicit cellular immunity is often unsuccessful . Furthermore , these studies add to the emerging field of microbial subversion of innate and cellular immunity and serve as a primer for defining new regulatory signalling pathways [55] . These studies shed new light on the classic observation that only microbes entering the host cell cytosol lead to a productive antigen-specific CD8 T cell response . It is not simply a case of inefficient antigen processing and presentation or the inability to activate the cytosolic surveillance pathway; the innate immune response to bacteria residing within a phagosome negates the innate and adaptive response to otherwise stimulatory bacterial products . Additional experiments are required to define the exact receptor-ligand interactions that take place within a phagosome , as well as to identify other cytokines and chemokines that may impact inflammation and T cell potency in this scenario . Understanding these negative regulatory pathways will be pivotal for the rational design of safe and potent vaccines that elicit long-lived T cell-mediated immunity . \n All animal protocols were approved by the Earle A .

{"lay_summary": "Primary open angle glaucoma is a blinding disease for which there is currently no cure , only treatments that may slow its progress . To help understand the mechanisms of this disease and to design more effective treatments , we identified previously a locus , SIX6 , that increases the risk of glaucoma . This gene is involved in early eye development and helps to form the retina . In this paper , we test specific sequence variants in SIX6 that are found in glaucoma patients . We show that these variants have a reduced function that interferes with their ability to direct proper formation of the retina . One variant in particular is common , and may be the main reason that this gene is important in the glaucoma disease process . Patients who have two copies of this sequence variant show a change in the structure of their eye consistent with fewer neurons that carry the visual signal to the brain . These neurons typically die as people age , and people who begin life with fewer visual neurons may have an increased risk of glaucoma . Additional research in this topic may lead to new treatments that preserve sight .", "article": "Glaucoma is a leading cause of blindness worldwide . Primary open-angle glaucoma ( POAG ) is the most common subtype and is a complex trait with multigenic inheritance . Genome-wide association studies have previously identified a significant association between POAG and the SIX6 locus ( rs10483727 , odds ratio ( OR ) =\u200a1 . 32 , p\u200a=\u200a3 . 87\u00d710\u221211 ) . SIX6 plays a role in ocular development and has been associated with the morphology of the optic nerve . We sequenced the SIX6 coding and regulatory regions in 262 POAG cases and 256 controls and identified six nonsynonymous coding variants , including five rare and one common variant , Asn141His ( rs33912345 ) , which was associated significantly with POAG ( OR\u200a=\u200a1 . 27 , p\u200a=\u200a4 . 2\u00d710\u221210 ) in the NEIGHBOR/GLAUGEN datasets . These variants were tested in an in vivo Danio rerio ( zebrafish ) complementation assay to evaluate ocular metrics such as eye size and optic nerve structure . Five variants , found primarily in POAG cases , were hypomorphic or null , while the sixth variant , found only in controls , was benign . One variant in the SIX6 enhancer increased expression of SIX6 and disrupted its regulation . Finally , to our knowledge for the first time , we have identified a clinical feature in POAG patients that appears to be dependent upon SIX6 genotype: patients who are homozygous for the SIX6 risk allele ( His141 ) have a statistically thinner retinal nerve fiber layer than patients homozygous for the SIX6 non-risk allele ( Asn141 ) . Our results , in combination with previous SIX6 work , lead us to hypothesize that SIX6 risk variants disrupt the development of the neural retina , leading to a reduced number of retinal ganglion cells , thereby increasing the risk of glaucoma-associated vision loss . \n Primary open-angle glaucoma ( POAG ) is the most common type of glaucoma , a group of diseases that affect approximately 60 million people worldwide and is a leading cause of blindness [1] . Glaucoma is characterized by the progressive death of retinal ganglion cells , leading to optic nerve atrophy and loss of vision . POAG is a complex inherited disorder for which an increasing number of genetic associations have been described , each contributing modestly to disease burden [2] , [3] . A recent POAG genome-wide association study found a significant genetic association ( rs10483727 , odds ratio ( OR ) =\u200a1 . 32 , p\u200a=\u200a3 . 87\u00d710\u221211 ) at the SIX1/SIX6 locus [4] . Variants in the SIX1/SIX6 locus were first associated with quantitative optic nerve parameters in controls , including vertical cup-disc ratio ( VCDR ) , which is used clinically to diagnose and monitor POAG progression [5] , [6] . Several studies have independently confirmed the association of the SIX1/SIX6 locus with both VCDR and POAG [7]\u2013[9] . The human SIX gene family consists of six members ( SIX1\u2013SIX6 ) , all of which contain two shared protein domains; a DNA binding homeobox domain and a SIX domain , which binds downstream effector molecules [10] , [11] . Members of this conserved gene family were originally identified through homology to the Drosophila melanogaster ( Drosophila ) sine oculis ( so ) gene , which is required for proper eye development [10] , [11] and are thought to function as transcription factors , regulating key developmental steps through a complex regulatory network . During embryonic development , SIX1 is expressed broadly in multiple tissues , including the otic vesicle and the limb mesenchyme . However , expression of SIX6 is restricted to regions of the retina and the pituitary [10] , [12] . Drosophila with null so alleles have restricted retinal development , while morpholino knockdown of six6b in Danio rerio ( zebrafish ) embryos was recently shown to result in a small eye phenotype [10] , [13] . In humans , a large deletion on chromosome 14q22 . 3-q23 that includes SIX6 causes bilateral anophthalmia , the absence of both eyes , demonstrating the importance of SIX gene family members in ocular development and human disease [10] , [11] , [14]\u2013[16] . In this study , we have extended the current understanding of the molecular contributions of SIX6 to POAG risk . First , we identified potential POAG risk alleles by sequencing the SIX6 gene in a case-control dataset; we found both common and rare coding changes within SIX6 in POAG cases , as well as sequence variants in the SIX6 enhancer . We then used the zebrafish system to demonstrate that these human coding variants have functional consequences in eye development . This analysis of 2\u20133 day old zebrafish embryos is not intended to fully recapitulate the glaucomatous phenotype; however , it provides in vivo data about the functional effects of human genetic variation on the human SIX6 protein in the context of eye development . We next used luciferase reporter assays , through which we show that a sequence variant found in the SIX6 enhancer of POAG patients may increase SIX6 expression . Finally , we demonstrate that POAG cases homozygous for the SIX6 risk allele rs33912345 have a significantly thinner retinal nerve fiber layer , suggesting a glaucomatous pathogenic mechanism driven by SIX6 dysfunction . \n Sequencing of the SIX1 and SIX6 genes in Caucasian POAG cases and controls ( 262 cases , 256 controls ) revealed 23 SNPs ( Supplemental Table S1 ) . Nine SNPs were identified in SIX1 , but no nonsynonymous SNPs were present in the POAG cases . Sequencing of SIX6 yielded 14 variants including five rare nonsynonymous SNPs in POAG cases and controls , one common nonsynonymous SNP located in the homeobox of SIX6 ( rs33912345 , Asn141His ) , and five sequence variants within the SIX6 enhancer . All of these variants are conserved evolutionarily as shown by their positive Genomic Evolution Rate Profiling ( GERP ) scores ( Table 1 ) [17] . Genotyping of rs33912345 in the Duke POAG case-control dataset ( 482 cases , 433 controls ) resulted in a significant association ( OR\u200a=\u200a1 . 40 , p\u200a=\u200a0 . 0005 , POAG case minor allele frequency ( MAF ) =\u200a0 . 47 , POAG control MAF\u200a=\u200a0 . 38 ) with POAG . This SNP is in high linkage disequilibrium ( r2\u200a=\u200a0 . 95 ) with the intergenic SNP identified originally in POAG and VCDR genome-wide association studies ( rs10483727 ) [4]\u2013[6] , [13] . As expected , meta-analysis of the imputed genotype data from the NEIGHBOR and GLAUGEN studies confirmed a significant association between POAG status and rs33912345 ( OR\u200a=\u200a1 . 27 , p\u200a=\u200a4 . 2\u00d710\u221210 ) and other linked SNPs in the region ( Supplemental Table S2 ) . Further examination of this locus showed that the association signal includes both upstream and downstream regions of the SIX6 transcript , while remaining entirely downstream of SIX1 ( Supplemental 1 ) . We next performed optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) to study the retinal characteristics of POAG cases possessing the SIX6 risk and non-risk variants ( Table 2 ) . OCT images were only available for POAG cases with the common SNP , rs33912345; no data were available for individuals with the rare SIX6 variants . We assessed retinal nerve fiber layer ( RNFL ) thickness in thirty POAG cases homozygous for the rs33912345 risk allele ( C ) or the non-risk allele ( A ) first by comparing age at disease diagnosis and age at OCT across the two genotypes , because age is known to influence retinal thickness and is thus a potential confounder . We observed no significant difference in age ( p\u200a=\u200a0 . 11 , p\u200a=\u200a0 . 14 , respectively ) . Next , RNFL thickness was evaluated . The overall thickness ( global RNFL ) was reduced significantly in cases homozygous for the risk allele compared to cases with the non-risk allele ( p\u200a=\u200a0 . 03; mean ( SD ) : C\u200a=\u200a58 . 3 ( 8 . 2 ) \u00b5m , A\u200a=\u200a67 . 9 ( 12 . 4 ) \u00b5m; Table 2 ) , consistent with the hypothesis that SIX6 may increase POAG susceptibility via changes in the neural retina . To determine which quadrants might be driving this observation , we performed an exploratory , post-hoc comparison of RNFL thickness in the temporal , nasal , inferior , and superior regions . We found that RNFL thickness was reduced significantly in the inferior ( p\u200a=\u200a0 . 03 ) and superior ( p\u200a=\u200a0 . 04 ) quadrants , the two regions affecting directly VCDR measurements . Given 1 ) the observed association signal pattern; 2 ) the lack of coding changes identified in SIX1; 3 ) the presence of rare missense variants and a common , associated missense SNP in SIX6; 4 ) retinal nerve fiber layer thickness changes observed in POAG cases homozygous for the SIX6 risk allele; and 5 ) the localized expression of SIX6 in ocular tissues , we concluded SIX6 is a likely candidate gene in this region . We therefore evaluated the functional relevance of SIX6 and the potential burden of common and rare alleles in this locus in POAG using an in vivo zebrafish complementation assay . First , we performed a reciprocal BLAST analysis; we identified two orthologs of SIX6 in the zebrafish genome , Six6a and Six6b , both with 91% homology at the protein level ( Supplemental Figure S2 ) . Previous overexpression and loss of function studies of Six6 in Mus musculus ( mouse ) and Xenopus laevis ( Xenopus ) models reveal a role in regulating the proliferative state of retinal progenitor cells and the size of the eye [18] , [19]; therefore , as a first test of whether the identified SIX6 variants are pathogenic and potentially relevant to POAG , we asked whether 1 ) morpholino-induced suppression of six6a or six6b leads to a reduced eye size; 2 ) expression of the human SIX6 non-risk allele rescues the morphant eye phenotype; and 3 ) expression of SIX6 alleles containing POAG risk variants rescues the morphant eye phenotype . Using translation-blocking morpholinos ( MOs ) targeting zebrafish six6a and six6b , we injected 1\u20138 cell stage embryos ( N\u200a=\u200a50\u2013150 ) and analyzed live embryos at 3 days post fertilization ( dpf ) . We also tested a splice blocking MO . However , this induced non-specific toxicity , including the accumulation of pericardial fluid that could not be rescued with the human SIX6 transcript . This is not unexpected , as SIX6 is a two exon gene\u2014splice-blocking MOs are generally not recommended for two exon genes; the targeted transcript will not be subject to nonsense mediated decay , possibly leading to the expression of a truncated protein and potential dominant-negative effects ( described by the manufacturer: http://www . gene-tools . com/node/18 ) . For these reasons , we used translation-blocking MOs for the remainder of our experiments . Masked scoring of both six6a and six6b morphants revealed ocular phenotypes consistent with loss of function , including a reduction in eye size in more than 80% of embryos ( p<0 . 001 , Figure 1 ) . The specificity of the MO was tested by co-injection of 12 . 5 pg of the human SIX6 non-risk allele mRNA; we observed significant ( p<0 . 001 ) rescue in six6a but not six6b morphant embryos ( 90% vs . 10% of embryos , respectively ) . Together , these data indicate that Six6a is the functional ortholog of human SIX6 and prompted subsequent evaluation of SIX6 variants using the six6a MO . To investigate the pathogenic potential of all SIX6 variants , we used total eye size and the rescue of the morphant phenotype as the assay's phenotypic readout . We injected a mixture containing six6a MO and each of the human SIX6 alleles containing the coding variants identified via sequencing ( Table 1 ) . Subsequent to triplicate injections and masked scoring , these results were compared to the rescue condition of the human SIX6 non-risk allele . We found that five of the six variants tested were unable to fully rescue the small eye phenotype . Four of these alleles ( Glu129Lys , Asn141His , Thr212Met , and Ser242Ile ) resulted in an average eye size larger than the morpholino alone ( p<0 . 001 ) , but smaller than the rescue with the non-risk allele ( p<0 . 001 ) , indicating that these alleles are hypomorphic ( Figure 2 , Table 3 ) . We also observed one variant ( Leu205Arg ) with an average eye size smaller than the morpholino alone ( p\u200a=\u200a0 . 002; mean ( SD ) : MO\u200a=\u200a34 , 042 ( 5 , 763 ) \u00b5m2 , Leu205Arg\u200a=\u200a31 , 568 ( 6 , 485 ) \u00b5m2; Figure 2 ) , suggesting that it is functionally null . Finally , one allele ( Glu93Gln ) resulted in an eye size similar to the rescue with the non-risk allele ( p\u200a=\u200a0 . 37 ) and was determined to be benign . The benign allele was identified in one control individual , while the remaining hypomorphic and null alleles were identified either exclusively or primarily in POAG cases ( Table 1 ) . Injection of 12 . 5 pg of the human SIX6 risk mRNA into non-morphant zebrafish provided no evidence of a toxic gain of function compared to injection with the non-risk allele ( data not shown ) . Given the reduction of the RNFL in cases homozygous for the risk allele , we next asked whether six6a and the identified SIX6 variants impacted the optic nerve , an anatomical site directly relevant to human POAG , in zebrafish . Using whole mount imaging of acetylated-tubulin expression in 2-dpf embryos injected with a control and six6a morpholino , we evaluated volumetric regions of interest ( ROI ) along the optic nerve ( Supplemental Figure S3 ) . Masked scoring of embryos revealed an approximately 3 fold reduction ( p<0 . 001 ) in the volume of the optic nerve upon depletion of six6a ( Figure 3 A\u2013B ) . This was specific for the optic nerve as the volume of other axonal tracts in the brain were unaffected by six6a depletion ( Figure 3A ) . Specificity of the volumetric measurements was demonstrated upon full rescue of the six6a morphant phenotype by co-injection of the non-risk allele ( p<0 . 001 ) or a variant that scored as a benign allele in the eye size assay ( Glu93Gln; p<0 . 001; Figure 3B ) . Both Leu205Arg and Asn141His variants performed as hypomorphic alleles ( p<0 . 01 ) , revealing concordance of our optic nerve assay with the OCT imaging findings in patients . We hypothesized that POAG risk may be mediated not only by deficits in SIX6 protein function , but also by the level of SIX6 gene expression . To test this , we sequenced the SIX6 retinal specific enhancer element in 262 POAG cases and 256 POAG controls; we identified five variants ( Chr14:60974363_C , Chr14:60974373_T , Chr14:60974378_T , Chr14:60974400_A , Chr14:60974449_G ) ( Table 1 ) , and tested their effect on expression using an in vitro luciferase assay . We found that one of these variants ( Chr14:60974449_G ) resulted in a significant increase in expression compared to the reference enhancer ( Figure 4 ) . Activation of the SIX6 enhancer requires two cofactors , NeuroD and E47 ( Supplemental Figure S4 ) [12] . Overexpression was observed with the Chr14:60974449_G variant even in the absence of these cofactors ( Supplemental Figure S5 ) , suggesting variants within the enhancer region may result in dysregulated protein expression . \n The SIX1/SIX6 locus has been shown to be associated significantly with POAG in several independent studies; however , the causal variant ( s ) driving this association have remained unknown [4] , [6]\u2013[9] , [13] , as has the direction of effect of these common alleles on protein function . We have demonstrated through several lines of evidence\u2014the tissue specificity of the SIX gene family described in the literature; the identification of SIX6 missense variants in our POAG dataset; and the results of the in vivo and in vitro assays\u2014 that SIX6 is the most likely POAG susceptibility gene in this region . We identified both common and rare coding variants that alter the function of the SIX6 protein . We also identified a novel variant within the SIX6 enhancer that appears to disrupt the regulation of SIX6 expression , suggesting both regulatory and coding variants may influence POAG susceptibility at this locus . Finally , we identified hitherto unknown clinical features in POAG patients that may be dependent upon SIX6 genotype: patients homozygous for the SIX6 risk allele have a significantly thinner retinal nerve fiber layer than patients homozygous for the SIX6 non-risk allele . The common variant , rs33912345 ( Asn141His ) , which we showed has significantly reduced function in an in vivo model , was associated with POAG in our dataset and is in strong linkage disequilibrium with the originally identified GWAS SNP , rs10483727 [4] . This conserved amino acid is located within the alpha helix structure of the DNA homeobox domain of SIX6 . Interestingly , the ancestral allele ( C , His ) is associated with POAG risk . The allele frequency of this variant differs markedly among populations ( C allele frequency: YRI ( 0 . 99 ) , ARF ( 0 . 96 ) , ASN ( 0 . 76 ) , and CEU ( 0 . 42 ) ; from 1000 Genomes release 14 ) [20] . This locus is associated significantly with an increase in vertical cup-disc ratio ( VCDR ) in population controls , indicating that it may be involved in the development of the optic nerve . VCDR is also a clinical measure used to track disease progression in POAG patients [5] , [6] , [9] , [13] , [21] . We note that African populations have larger VCDR and an increase in overall POAG prevalence [22]\u2013[24] compared to CEU populations; in a recent study , the prevalence of POAG in Ghana exceeded 17% , the highest rate observed anywhere in the world [25] . While rs33912345 is not associated with POAG risk in a West African POAG case/control dataset from Ghana , the frequency of the ancestral ( risk ) allele is 99% in both cases and controls [26] . We hypothesize that differences in the structure of the optic nerve and the higher risk of POAG in individuals with African ancestry may , in part , arise from the fact that essentially all individuals in this population are homozygous for the rs33912345 ancestral risk allele . Given the association of the SIX6 locus with neural retinal measurements such as VCDR , it is reasonable to hypothesize causal variants may function by inducing quantitative changes in cell populations in the retina . There is extensive evidence that SIX6 regulates early retinal progenitor cell proliferation during eye development [18] , [19] , [27] . Li et al . showed that Six6\u2212/\u2212 mice display varying degrees of retinal hypoplasia that is due to a decrease in retinal ganglion cell proliferation arising from an early exit from the cell cycle during development , and results in a 20% decrease in the number of retinal ganglion cells by P35 [18] . This is consistent with functional studies of XOptx2 , the Xenopus ortholog of SIX6 [19] . We have shown a reduction in eye size and in the volume of the optic nerve upon MO knockdown of zebrafish six6a , and we were able to rescue these phenotypes with co-injection of the human SIX6 non-risk allele , demonstrating that the zebrafish six6a gene is the likely functional ortholog to human SIX6 . We identified five alleles that could not rescue the small eye and optic nerve phenotypes , and we observed a reduction in retinal nerve fiber layer thickness in POAG patients homozygous for the His141 SIX6 risk allele . Taken together with previously published findings , our results suggest that risk variants in human SIX6 increase POAG susceptibility by negatively affecting retinal ganglion cell development , likely leading to a reduction in the number of retinal ganglion cells in adulthood . Given that retinal ganglion cells are lost during the normal aging process , we speculate that this rate of loss could be increased by the presence of additional POAG risk alleles or other risk factors such as increased intraocular pressure [28] . The development of glaucomatous optic neuropathy and associated visual field loss would thus be hastened by a reduction in the initial number of retinal ganglion cells that an individual possesses . Future work will test the possibility that SIX6 variants also alter the rate of RGC death in the adult . In summary , we have identified multiple common and rare SIX6 sequence variants in POAG cases , and used in vivo and in vitro assays to demonstrate that these variants have functional consequences on SIX6 expression and protein function . While other risk factors may be required for the onset of POAG , our data suggest that attenuation of SIX6 protein function increases an individual's susceptibility to developing the disease via changes to retinal development . Additional work is needed , possibly through the use of transgenic animal model studies , to fully understand the role of SIX6 in POAG . \n This research was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Duke University Medical Center and adheres to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki . Study subjects were unrelated patients from the Duke Eye Center and , after a comprehensive eye examine , were classified as either POAG cases or controls . POAG cases presented with glaucomatous optic neuropathy , defined as a cup-to-disc ratio greater than 0 . 7 and visual field loss in at least one eye . Patients with secondary forms of glaucoma or a history of ocular trauma were excluded from the study . POAG controls had no evidence of optic neuropathy , normal intraocular pressure ( less than 22 mmHg in both eyes ) , and normal visual fields , assessed using standard automated perimetry . Genomic DNA was extracted from patient blood samples using the PureGene chemistry following the manufacturer's standard protocol ( Gentra , Minneapolis , MN ) . The coding portions ( 2 exons ) of the SIX1 and SIX6 genes were sequenced in 518 Caucasian POAG cases and controls ( 262 cases , 256 controls ) using a polymerase chain-reaction ( PCR ) containing 1\u00d7 Qiagen PCR buffer ( Tris\u00b7Cl , KCl , ( NH4 ) 2SO4 , 15 mM MgCl2; pH 8 . 7 ) ; 200 \u00b5M each of dATP , dCTP , dGTP , and dTTP; 0 . 4 \u00b5M forward PCR primer; 0 . 4 \u00b5M reverse PCR primer; 3 \u00b5L of betaine , 10 ng genomic DNA; and 0 . 5 U HotStarTaq DNA polymerase ( Qiagen , Venlo , Limburg ) to a final volume of 25 \u00b5L . Primer sequences are available in Supplemental Table S3 . The PCR was performed using a touchdown protocol ( incremental lowering of annealing temperature ) using the following thermocycler conditions: 94\u00b0C for 30 s , 65\u00b0C for 30 s , 72\u00b0C for 30 s with a 2\u00b0C decrease in the annealing temperature every two cycles until a final annealing temperature of 55\u00b0C was reached . The retinal specific SIX6 enhancer , previously described [12] , was amplified a using a touchdown protocol with a final annealing temperature of 57\u00b0C . PCR products were sequencing using the BigDye chemistry on a 3730 DNA Analyzer ( Applied Biosystems , Grand Island , NY ) . The common missense single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) , rs33912345 , was genotyped in the Duke POAG case-control dataset consisting of 482 POAG cases and 433 POAG controls using a TaqMan allelic discrimination assay according to the standard protocols from the manufacturer ( Life Technologies , Grand Island , NY ) . For quality control purposes the following criteria were met: >95% genotyping efficiency , matching sample duplicates ( two Centre d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humain samples per 96-well plate whose genotype data matched across all plates ) , and Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium assumptions . We tested for association of rs33912345 with POAG using an additive logistic regression model adjusted for age and sex using SAS [29] . Genome-wide genotype data were available from the NEI Glaucoma Human Genetics Collaboration ( NEIGHBOR ) and the Glaucoma Genes and Environment ( GLAUGEN ) consortia [4] . Chromosome 14 was imputed using IMPUTE2 ( http://mathgen . stats . ox . ac . uk/impute/impute_v2 . html ) with a global 1000 Genomes reference panel . We tested SNPs at the SIX1/SIX6 locus for association with POAG using an additive logistic regression model adjusted for age , sex , and four principal components ( NEIGHBOR ) or age , gender , study site , DNA extraction method , DNA specimen type and principal components 1\u20136 ( GLAUGEN ) implemented in PLINK and visualized using LocusZoom ( http://csg . sph . umich . edu/locuszoom/ ) [30] , [31] . A meta-analysis was performed in Plink using a random effects model . Linkage disequilibrium was calculated and visualized using Haploview ( http://www . broadinstitute . org/scientific-community/science/programs/medical-and-population-genetics/haploview/haploview ) [32] . Optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) measurements of retinal nerve fiber layer ( RNFL ) by Spectralis ( Heidelberg Engineering , Carlsbad , CA ) spectral domain ) and fundus photography were available from the Duke Eye Center . OCT images are not routinely performed in patients without ocular disease , so there was limited data available for controls . Therefore , the analysis was restricted to POAG cases homozygous for rs33912345 . Thirty patients had both OCT measurements and SIX6 genotype data . RNFL thickness , age at POAG diagnosis , and the age at OCT measurement were compared between individuals homozygous for the risk or non-risk allele using a Student's t-test . Analyses were performed in SAS [29] . A vector containing human SIX6 was purchased from the CCSB Human ORFeome Collection that uses the Gateway technology system ( Open Biosystems and Life Technologies , Grand Island , NY ) . SIX6 alleles identified by sequencing ( Glu93Gln , Glu129Lys , Asn141His , Leu205Arg , Thr212Met , Ser242IIe ) , were created using the QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit and protocols provided by the manufacturer ( Agilent Technologies ) . SIX6 mRNA was in vitro transcribed using mMESSAGE mMACHINE SP6 Kit ( Ambion , Life Technologies , Grand Island , NY ) . Translation blocker ( TB ) morpholinos against six6a ( 5\u2032- CTGGAACATGGAGACTGTAATGTCT -3\u2032 ) and six6b ( 5\u2032 AATTGGCAACTGAAACATGAAGGCT 3\u2032 ) were purchased from Gene Tools , LLC . Morpholino ( 2 ng ) and mRNA ( 12 . 5 pg ) were mixed and a volume of 0 . 5 nL was microinjected into each wild-type zebrafish embryo at one- to eight-cell stage as described previously ( Stuart , McMurray et al . 1988 ) . Morphometric analyses of eye size were conducted on zebrafish embryos at 3 days post fertilization , using a Nikon SMZ 745T microscope . Zebrafish were anesthetized in embryo medium containing 0 . 2 mg/ml tricaine ( Ethyl 3-aminobenzoate methanesulfonate , Sigma , E10521 ) . Lateral view images were captured with Nikon DS-Fi1 camera , and the size of eye was measured with Nikon NIS-Elements AR software . Analysis of the optic nerve was performed on 2 dpf embryos fixed in Dent's fixative ( 80% Methanol and 20% DMSO ) overnight and stained with acetylated-tubulin ( Sigma; T7451 ) . Heads were isolated from stained embryos and oriented with the ventral aspect facing a coverslip on microscope cover glass . Image acquisition was performed on a Zeiss 710 inverted confocal microscope and \u223c100 um optical sections were obtained and reconstructed . Volumetric measurements were calculated using Imaris software and 7 . 5 um\u00d77 . 5 um\u00d715 um ROIs along the optic nerve were analyzed between each condition . ROIs were restricted to portions of the optic nerve wherein all neurite processes coalesced to form the major aspect of the nerve . SIX6 enhancer alleles were tested using the dual-luciferase reporter assay system ( Promega , Madison , WI ) . An experimental construct containing a minimal promoter ( pGL4 . 23 , firefly luciferase , Promega ) was used to test the functional effect of the enhancer alleles identified by sequencing ( Chr14:60974363_C , Chr14:60974373_T , Chr14:60974378_T , Chr14:60974400_A , Chr14:60974449_G ) in the POAG case/control dataset . The experimental constructs ( pGL4 . 23+Enhancer ) were generated using a nested PCR protocol; the XhoI and HindII enzymes; the Quick Ligation kit ( New England BioLabs , Ipswich , MA ) ; and the QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit ( Agilent Technologies ) , following protocols provided by the manufacturers . Constructs were confirmed to be correct by sequencing . Hek293 cells were cultured according to the supplier's suggestions ( ATCC , Manassas , VA ) . As described by Conte et al . , co-transfection with NeuroD and E47 is required for SIX6 enhancer activation [12] . Therefore , cells were co-transfected with an experimental vector ( pGL4 . 23+Enhancer ) , a control vector ( pGL4 . 74 , renilla luciferase , Promega ) , and vectors containing NeuroD and E47 ( provided by the Center for Human Disease Modeling , Duke University ) using a standard calcium phosphate transfection protocol . The experiment was performed three times in triplicate and the results were analyzed using the dual luciferase reporter ( DLR ) ratio ( firefly luciferase sum: renilla luciferase sum ) normalized by the reference SIX6 enhancer included on every plate . The data were analyzed using an ANOVA , adjusted for batch , and linear contrasts were used to determine the effect of each vector . Statistical analyses were performed in SAS [29] .", "headings": ["Abstract", "Introduction", "Results", "Discussion", "Materials and Methods"], "keywords": ["genetics", "biology and life sciences", "human genetics", "genetics of disease", "gene function"], "id": "journal.pgen.1004372"}
{"lay_summary": "Clostridium difficile is a bacterial pathogen that causes antibiotic associated diarrheal disease . Colonization of host tissues is a prerequisite step to disease development during bacterial infection . C . difficile produces flagella , which are proteinaceous structures on the bacterial surface that confer motility and participate in adherence to the host intestine . SigD , a regulator that coordinates flagellar gene expression , also activates expression of the toxin genes in C . difficile . Therefore , mechanisms controlling expression of flagellar genes , including sigD , will likely impact the severity of C . difficile infection given the impact on toxin production . In this body of work , we identified a genetic ON/OFF switch , which we term the \u201cflagellar switch\u201d , encoded upstream of the flagellar genes . The orientation of the flagellar switch determines whether or not C . difficile produce flagella , engage in swimming motility , and secrete toxins . We identified the enzyme that catalyzes inversion of the flagellar switch . Inactivation of the corresponding gene resulted in bacteria with the flagellar switch locked in the either the ON or OFF orientation , with concomitant effects on flagellum and toxin biosynthesis . The flagellar switch may represent a new regulatory strategy to coordinately control virulence determinants independent of previously described regulators .", "article": "In the human intestinal pathogen Clostridium difficile , flagella promote adherence to intestinal epithelial cells . Flagellar gene expression also indirectly impacts production of the glucosylating toxins , which are essential to diarrheal disease development . Thus , factors that regulate the expression of the flgB operon will likely impact toxin production in addition to flagellar motility . Here , we report the identification a \u201cflagellar switch\u201d that controls the phase variable production of flagella and glucosylating toxins . The flagellar switch , located upstream of the flgB operon containing the early stage flagellar genes , is a 154 bp invertible sequence flanked by 21 bp inverted repeats . Bacteria with the sequence in one orientation expressed flagellum and toxin genes , produced flagella , and secreted the toxins ( \u201cflg phase ON\u201d ) . Bacteria with the sequence in the inverse orientation were attenuated for flagellar and toxin gene expression , were aflagellate , and showed decreased toxin secretion ( \u201cflg phase OFF\u201d ) . The orientation of the flagellar switch is reversible during growth in vitro . We provide evidence that gene regulation via the flagellar switch occurs post-transcription initiation and requires a C . difficile-specific regulatory factor to destabilize or degrade the early flagellar gene mRNA when the flagellar switch is in the OFF orientation . Lastly , through mutagenesis and characterization of flagellar phase locked isolates , we determined that the tyrosine recombinase RecV , which catalyzes inversion at the cwpV switch , is also responsible for inversion at the flagellar switch in both directions . Phase variable flagellar motility and toxin production suggests that these important virulence factors have both advantageous and detrimental effects during the course of infection . \n Clostridium difficile , a Gram-positive , spore-forming obligate anaerobe , is the leading cause of nosocomial disease in the North America , Europe and Australia [1 , 2] . The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention list C . difficile infections ( CDI ) as an urgent threat related to the use of antibiotics [3] . Antibiotic use perturbs the gastrointestinal microbiota that normally protects against CDI [1 , 4] . The rates of recurrence and mortality associated with CDI have increased in part due to the emergence of epidemic-associated strains with enhanced sporulation rates and toxin production [1 , 5 , 6] . The C . difficile PCR ribotype 027 group is associated with greater odds of diarrheal disease severity , outcome , and death compared to many other PCR ribotypes [7] . Therefore , an understanding of bacterial physiology and genetics in C . difficile 027 ribotypes could reveal unique therapeutic or diagnostic targets to ameliorate severe CDI . C . difficile is primarily transmitted as metabolically dormant spores , which germinate into actively growing vegetative cells in response to bile salts such as glycine-conjugated taurocholate [8\u201310] . CDI ranges in severity from mild self-limiting diarrhea to fulminant colitis characterized by neutrophil infiltration into the lamina propria , erosion of crypts and goblet cells , and extensive epithelial tissue damage . Diarrheal disease is associated with strains that produce the glucosylating toxins TcdA and/or TcdB [11 , 12] . Both TcdA and TcdB glucosylate Rho and Rac GTPases in host cells to promote actin depolymerization , destruction of tight junctions at the mucosal barrier , and inflammation [13\u201316] . The glucosylating toxins are necessary for diarrheal disease in both the mouse and hamster models of infection , with TcdB playing a more prominent role [11 , 12 , 17] . Colonization is a requisite step to diarrheal disease , and the bacterial surface structures , such as flagella , that participate in colonization are an active area of study . The flagellar apparatus confers motility and contributes to adherence , colonization , and disease in C . difficile [18\u201320] . Flagellum biosynthesis genes are conserved in most sequenced C . difficile strains [19 , 21] . As in other bacterial species , flagellar gene transcription occurs in a hierarchical order to ensure proper protein assembly and to conserve energy . The early stage flagellar operon contains genes for assembly of the basal body . SigD ( \u03c3D ) , the flagellar alternative sigma factor , is encoded in the early stage flagellar operon and activates the transcription of the late stage operons [22 , 23] . At least four operons contain late stage flagellar genes involved in assembly of the flagellar hook , filament , and cap , and for post-translational modification of the flagellar filament [18 , 22 , 24\u201326] . Flagellar arrangement is peritrichous in most strains [18 , 27\u201331] . The flagellar apparatus contributes to C . difficile fitness during gastrointestinal infection in a ribotype-dependent manner [20] . In C . difficile 630\u0394erm ( ribotype 012 ) , flagella are dispensable for adherence to cultured epithelial cells and colonization in the murine model [31 , 32] . In contrast , in the epidemic-associated C . difficile strain R20291 ( ribotype 027 ) , flagellar filaments promote adherence and colonization in vitro and during infection of mice [31] . Flagellar motility is not required for adherence in this strain , as a MotB mutant that produces flagellar filaments with a nonfunctional motor displays wild type adherence [31] . Interestingly , mice infected with the R20291 fliC mutant succumb to infection , whereas mice infected with the parental strain do not [31] . The R20291 fliC mutant has altered expression of genes involved in motility , membrane transport , sporulation , and metabolism in vitro [33] , which may explain the enhanced virulence in mice . Post-translational modification of flagella also contributes to colonization kinetics in a mouse relapse model of infection in M68 , an 017 ribotype strain [24] . In the hamster model , C . difficile 630\u0394erm strains with a mutation in several early stage flagellar genes showed reduced virulence , whereas C . difficile with mutations in the late stage flagellar genes fliC and fliD generally showed increased virulence [22 , 32] . Several groups have observed that a 630\u0394erm fliC mutant produces more toxin , which may contribute to the increased virulence of the mutant [22 , 31 , 32] . The animal model-dependent differences in virulence phenotypes of the flagellar gene mutants may be attributed to the greater sensitivity of hamsters to the glucosylating toxins [34] , and to higher spore germination rates of C . difficile spores in hamsters than in mice [35] . Notably , the expression of the glucosylating toxin genes is linked to flagellar gene expression in C . difficile [20 , 36] . TcdA and TcdB are encoded on a Pathogenicity Locus ( PaLoc ) along with the TcdR sigma factor that positively regulates tcdA and tcdB [37] , the anti-sigma factor TcdC suggested to inhibit TcdR function [38\u201341] , and the TcdE holin-like protein suggested to be involved in toxin export [42 , 43] . Preliminary studies suggested that \u03c3D affects the expression of the glucosylating toxin genes [22] . Subsequent work identified a \u03c3D consensus sequence in the tcdR promoter [23 , 44] . Overexpression of sigD in C . difficile increases toxin production in a TcdR-dependent manner [44] , and recombinant \u03c3D with RNA polymerase directly binds the tcdR promoter [23] . Taken together , these studies highlight a regulatory link between virulence factors critical to host colonization and to disease symptom development in C . difficile , similar to other diarrheal bacterial pathogens , such as Vibrio cholerae and Campylobacter jejuni [45 , 46] . C . difficile flagellin and the glucosylating toxins stimulate pathogen recognition receptors [47\u201349] , which promote pathogen clearance mechanisms , and therefore their production must be subject to precise regulation to avoid host recognition . In addition to \u03c3D , several transcriptional regulators modulate toxin production in C . difficile , potentially via regulation of flagellar gene expression . Spo0A , SigH , and RstA inhibit expression of the flagellar and toxin genes [50\u201353] , while Agr quorum sensing and Hfq are positive regulators [29 , 54] . The exact mechanisms by which these regulators control flagellar and toxin gene expression are largely unknown . Cyclic diguanylate ( c-di-GMP ) is a nucleotide second messenger that controls a multitude of bacterial processes , such as flagellar motility , biofilm formation , and virulence factor expression [55\u201358] . In C . difficile , c-di-GMP regulates swimming motility , cytopathicity , Type IV-pilus dependent surface motility and biofilm formation [30 , 44 , 59 , 60] . Specifically , elevated c-di-GMP inhibits flagellar gene expression and swimming motility [59] , and also negatively regulates toxin gene expression as a result of reduced sigD transcription [44] . Flagellar gene regulation occurs via a c-di-GMP sensing riboswitch , Cd1 , located in the 5\u2019 untranslated region of the early stage flagellar operon [61] . c-di-GMP binding to Cd1 causes premature transcription termination , resulting in a truncated transcript of 160 nt of the 5\u2019 untranslated region [62] . Here , we describe the identification and characterization of an additional cis-acting regulatory element that mediates phase variable expression of flagellar genes and , consequently , the toxin genes . We identified a flagellar switch consisting of 154 bp flanked by 21 bp imperfect inverted repeats , between the Cd1 riboswitch and the first open reading frame in the early stage flagellar operon . The orientation of the flagellar switch controls downstream flagellar gene expression , including sigD , and therefore production of flagella and swimming motility . Furthermore , the flagellar switch affects transcription of the toxin genes by way of \u03c3D , impacting the production of the glucosylating toxins and the cytotoxicity of C . difficile . We provide evidence that regulation through the flagellar switch occurs post-transcription initiation . Lastly , we identified RecV , which also controls phase variation of the cell wall protein CwpV , as the recombinase responsible for inversion at the flagellar switch in both directions . Together these findings indicate that flagellar motility and the production of toxins are subject to phase variation in C . difficile , thus identifying an additional level of regulation of these linked processes . Flagellar and toxin phase variation in C . difficile may confer an advantage to the bacterium during infection of the gastrointestinal tract as a bet hedging strategy to either promote colonization and inflammation as certain tissue sites or persist and evade host immune stimulation . \n Soutourina , et . al . , identified a single transcriptional start site ( TSS ) for the early flagellar operon in C . difficile strain 630\u0394erm , located nearly 500 nucleotides ( nt ) upstream of the start codon for flgB , the first gene in this operon [62] . The flgB operon is also termed the \u201cF3 locus\u201d elsewhere [21] . The promoter for the flgB operon contains a \u03c3A consensus sequence [62] . The first 160 nt of the 5\u2019 untranslated region ( UTR ) of the flgB operon contains a class I ( GEMM ) c-di-GMP riboswitch , previously named Cd1 [61] . Binding of c-di-GMP to Cd1 causes premature transcription termination , preventing flagellar gene transcription and inhibiting swimming motility [59 , 61 , 62] . Notably , an additional 338 nt lie between the Cd1 termination site and the start codon of flgB . We speculated that the remaining 338 nt of the 5\u2019 UTR contains an additional regulatory element that controls expression of the flgB operon . To explore this possibility , we used Clustal Omega [63] to generate multiple sequence alignments and examine the 5\u2019 UTR of the flgB operon for regions of reduced sequence identity . Assuming the TSS is conserved in all strains , we found that all C . difficile genome sequences currently available through NCBI contain a 498 nt 5\u2019 UTR , except 630 which has a 496 nt 5\u2019 UTR . Strains of the 027 ribotype , which is associated with epidemics of CDI , were used for further analysis: CD196 ( NCBI Accession No . FN538970 . 1 ) , R20291 ( FN545816 . 1 ) , 2007855 ( FN665654 . 1 ) , and BI1 ( FN668941 . 1 ) [19 , 64 , 65] . The 5\u2019 UTRs of three strains exhibited 100% sequence identity , but BI1 had only 66 . 2% identity in a 154 bp region ( Fig 1A ) . Upon further scrutiny of the region , we identified near perfect 21 bp inverted repeats flanking the 154 bp region: 5\u2019- AAGTT ( A/G ) CTAT ( A/T ) TTACAAAAAA-3\u2019 ( Left inverted repeat ) . The presence of a sequence flanked by inverted repeats located upstream of genes encoding an immunostimulatory surface structure suggested a regulatory mechanism involving phase variation by site specific DNA recombination . These features reflect a regulatory mechanism employed by numerous mucosal bacterial pathogens to stochastically control the expression of cell surface structures that may be immunostimulatory , therefore promoting immune evasion and persistence in a host [66] . We reasoned that the reduced sequence identity for BI1 at the 154 bp region could be due to DNA inversion between the inverted repeats . To test this , we repeated the multiple sequence alignment using the antiparallel , \u201cinverse\u201d sequence for the 154 bp sequence for BI1 and observed restoration of 100% identity to the other ribotype 027 sequences ( Fig 1A ) . Based on these in silico findings , we hypothesized that the 154 bp sequence undergoes inversion via site-specific recombination , and we term this the \u201cflagellar switch\u201d herein . If the 154 bp sequence is capable of undergoing DNA inversion , we expect to detect the flagellar switch in both of the orientations in C . difficile , at least under some growth conditions . To test this , we used an orientation-specific PCR assay to detect and differentiate between the two orientations of the putative flagellar switch in multiple C . difficile strains grown in liquid medium ( Fig 1B ) [67 , 68] . We use \u201cpublished orientation\u201d to refer to the sequence present in the indicated published genome for the given strain , and \u201cinverse orientation\u201d to refer to a sequence with an inversion between the inverted repeats . A common reverse primer , Rv , complementary to the flgB coding sequence was used in all PCRs ( Fig 1B , black ) . To detect the flagellar switch in the published orientation , we used a ribotype-specific forward primer F1 that anneals immediately 3\u2019 of the left inverted repeat ( LIR ) ( Fig 1B , green ) . To detect the flagellar switch in the inverse orientation , we used a forward primer F2 that anneals immediately 5\u2019 of the right inverted repeat ( RIR ) ( Fig 1B , red ) . Primers F1 and F2 are reverse-complementary . The primer pairs yield different products of different sizes depending on the orientation of the template sequence , and the sizes vary somewhat depending on the strain . We detected PCR products for both the published and inverse orientations for R20291 ( FN545816 . 1 ) and ATCC 43598 ( 017 ribotype , sequence read archive SRX656590 ) ( Fig 1C ) . DNA sequencing of the PCR products confirmed the orientation of the template sequences . Furthermore , DNA sequencing suggests that DNA strand exchange for recombination would have to occur at or after position 12 of the IRs , because the 6th and 11th nucleotides that are not conserved do not change . We were unable to detect a PCR product for the inverse orientation for 630\u0394erm ( Fig 1C ) , a commonly used laboratory-adapted strain . Unlike the other published C . difficile genomes , 630\u0394erm and its parental strain , 630 , have shorter 20 bp IRs with an adenosine absent from the 3\u2019 end of the LIR and a thymidine absent from the 5\u2019 end of the RIR . The length of IRs can impact DNA inversion [68] , which may explain the lack of an inverse product for 630\u0394erm . Collectively , these data indicate that at least some C . difficile strains grow in broth culture as a heterogeneous population of bacteria with the flagellar switch in the published or inverse orientation , supporting our hypothesis that the flagellar switch undergoes site-specific recombination . Based on the previously identified inversion sites in the C . difficile genomes [69] , we designate the flagellar switch site as Cdi4 . We optimized an unbiased asymmetric PCR-digestion assay to distinguish the orientation of the switch and determine the relative proportions of each in the population ( Fig 2A ) [67 , 68 , 70] . One pair of primers that flank the flagellar switch amplify a region encompassing the 5\u2019 UTR of the flgB operon , yielding a 665 bp product that was subjected to digestion with the restriction enzyme SwaI . The presence of a single SwaI restriction site in the 154 bp flagellar switch resulted in two fragments of different sizes depending on the orientation of the sequence ( Fig 2A ) . If the flagellar switch is in the published orientation , we expect fragments of 312 and 353 bp; if the switch is in the inverse orientation , we expect fragments of 418 and 247 bp . All four products are expected for a mixed population . Spore preparations of C . difficile R20291 , which contain a mix of bacteria with respect to flagellar switch orientation ( S1 Fig ) , were plated on BHIS agar supplemented with the germinant taurocholate . Germinated colonies were collected and spotted onto standard BHIS agar . We observed that over 96 hours , the R20291 colony morphology changed from smooth and circular to a spreading , filamentous colony ( Fig 2B ) . Genomic DNA was isolated from replicate colonies every 24 hours , and the asymmetric PCR-digestion assay was performed after all samples were processed . Over time , the abundance of the SwaI digested products indicating the inverse orientation increased ( Fig 2C ) . The proportions of bacteria with the switch in the two orientations were quantified by measuring the pixel intensities of the bands , normalized to a standard curve generated with titrated amounts of SwaI-digested DNA template for the published and inverse orientations [71] . The proportion of the bacteria with the flagellar switch in the inverse orientation significantly increased after 48 hours ( median of 33 . 8% , P < 0 . 005 ) , 72 hours ( 39 . 0% , P < 0 . 05 ) , and 96 hours ( 67 . 4% , P < 0 . 05 ) compared to 24 hours ( 26 . 4% ) ( Fig 2D ) . These data provide evidence of DNA inversion and suggest that growth on a solid agar surface favors the accumulation of C . difficile with the flagellar switch in the inverse orientation . Single colonies derived from this growth ( 24\u201396 hours on BHIS agar ) were subjected to the asymmetric PCR-digestion assay to determine the orientation of the flagellar switch . Individual colonies were enriched for one orientation of the flagellar switch . All colonies tested yielded either 312 and 353 bp fragments indicating the switch in the published orientation ( Fig 3A ) or 418 and 247 bp fragments indicating the switch in the inverse orientation ( Fig 3B ) . However , the asymmetric PCR-digestion has limited sensitivity for detection of low abundance targets . Thus , we used quantitative PCR ( qPCR ) of genomic DNA to quantify the frequency of bacteria with the flagellar switch in each orientation . In isolated colonies that showed fragments indicating the switch is in the published orientation by asymmetric PCR-digestion ( Fig 3A ) , 89 . 5% ( +/- 6 . 6% SD ) of the population had the switch in that orientation by qPCR ( Fig 3C ) . Similarly , in colonies with the switch predominantly in the inverse orientation by asymmetric PCR-digestion ( Fig 3B ) , 96 . 3% ( +/- 2 . 2% SD ) of the population has the switch in that orientation by qPCR ( Fig 3C ) . These data indicate that asymmetric PCR-digestion successfully identifies colonies that are enriched for the flagellar switch in a single orientation . Furthermore , the orientation of the flagellar switch remains stable during growth on an agar surface for at least 24 hours and switch orientation did not affect growth ( S2 Fig ) . We note that during these experiments , we observed two distinct colony morphologies based on colony texture and edge\u2014a smooth , circular ( SC ) morphotype , and a rough , filamentous ( RF ) morphotype ( S3 Fig ) . The percentage of RF colonies increased , and the percentage of SC colonies decreased over time ( S3 Fig ) . Bacteria from SC and RF colonies maintained their respective characteristic morphologies after passaging ( S3 Fig ) . Colony morphology was not attributable to the orientation of the flagellar switch , as 72% of bacteria in the SC colonies had the flagellar switch in the published orientation , and 64% of bacteria in the RF colonies had the flagellar switch in the inverse orientation ( S3 Fig ) . The enrichment of two populations based on the orientation of the flagellar switch allowed us to determine the impact of switch orientation on downstream gene expression . We purified colonies with the flagellar switch in the published and inverse orientations ( Fig 4A ) to assess gene expression . The abundances of early and late stage flagellar gene transcripts in the isolates were compared by quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR ( qRT-PCR ) . Bacteria with the flagellar switch in the inverse orientation exhibited significantly reduced abundance of early stage flagellar gene transcripts , such as flgB and sigD/fliA , compared to bacteria with the flagellar switch in the published orientation ( Fig 4B ) [23 , 44] . Accordingly , the abundances of the \u03c3D-dependent , late stage flagellar gene transcripts CDR20291_0227 ( autolysin ) , flgM ( flagellar anti-sigma factor ) , and fliC ( flagellin ) ( Fig 4B ) were also significantly decreased in bacteria with the flagellar switch in the inverse orientation . Consistent with this , transmission electron microscopy showed that the majority of bacteria from colonies with the flagellar switch in the published orientation displayed flagella ( 72% flagellated , n = 144 ) , whereas bacteria from colonies with the switch in the inverse orientation were largely non-flagellated ( 98% non- flagellated , n = 163 ) ( Fig 4C ) . We also note that C . difficile strain R20291 was previously reported to produce a single flagellum [31] , but we observed peritrichous flagella on our R20291 isolate . In addition , we generated a transcriptional fusion of mCherryOpt , encoding a Red Fluorescent Protein-derivative ( RFP ) optimized for translation in C . difficile [72 , 73] , to the flgM promoter . The flgM gene was previously determined to be positively regulated by \u03c3D [23 , 44] . As \u03c3D is encoded in the flgB operon , it is indirectly phase variable and serves as an indicator of the status of the flagellar switch . This plasmid-borne reporter ( PflgM::mCherryOpt ) was introduced into C . difficile R20291 isolates with the switch in the published or inverse orientation . In the isolate with the switch in the published orientation , the majority of bacteria were mCherryOpt positive: 76 . 7% ( +/- 9 . 8% SD ) . In the isolate with the switch in the inverse orientation , few bacteria were mCherryOpt positive: 2 . 4% ( +/- 2 . 2% SD ) ( Fig 4D ) . These values are consistent with those obtained using qPCR to directly evaluate the switch orientation in these populations ( Fig 3C ) . Differences in the frequency of the switch orientation in enriched flg ON populations could be due to additional flagellar gene regulators that function independently of the flg switch , such as c-di-GMP [59 , 62] . Negative controls bearing promoterless mCherryOpt ( ::mCherryOpt ) lacked fluorescence ( S4 Fig ) ; positive controls with inducible mCherryOpt ( Ptet::mCherryOpt ) showed more uniform red fluorescence ( S4 Fig ) . We additionally constructed a sigD mutant in R20291 by Targetron insertional mutagenesis as a negative control ( S5 Fig ) . The sigD mutant containing the PflgM::mCherryOpt reporter lacked mCherryOpt fluorescence , indicating that flgM promoter activity is dependent on \u03c3D , and therefore on the flagellar switch ( Fig 4D ) . Taken together , these data indicate that the orientation of the flagellar switch controls flagellar gene expression and are consistent with phase variable gene expression . Thus , bacteria with the flagellar switch in the published orientation express flagellar genes and produce flagella and are thus flagellar phase ON ( \u201cflg ON\u201d hereafter ) ; bacteria with the switch in the inverse orientation show decreased flagellar gene expression and flagellum biosynthesis and are comparatively flagellar phase OFF ( \u201cflg OFF\u201d hereafter ) . Given that flg OFF bacteria were deficient in flagellum biosynthesis ( Fig 4 ) , we predicted that flg OFF bacteria would be non-motile compared to motile flg ON bacteria . To test this , enriched flg ON and OFF isolates were examined for the ability to swim through BHIS-0 . 3% agar [59] . The R20291 sigD mutant was used as a non-motile control . The flg OFF bacteria appeared motile ( Fig 5A ) , though they displayed a modest but statistically significant reduction in swimming diameter at 24 and 48 hours post-inoculation compared to flg ON isolates ( Fig 5B ) . We reasoned that the enriched flg OFF inoculum would result in spatial restriction of non-motile bacteria to the inoculation site . In contrast , the small fraction of flg ON bacteria ( detectable by qPCR and fluorescent reporters but below the limitation of detection by asymmetric PCR digestion assay ) would be capable of motility and chemotaxis and therefore expand from the inoculation site , spatially segregating from flg OFF bacteria . To test this , for flg ON and OFF isolates cultured in motility agar , we sampled bacteria from the inoculation site ( center ) and from the leading edge at 24 , 48 , and 72 hours and determined the orientation of the switch using the asymmetric PCR-digestion assay . As expected , flg ON maintained the flagellar switch in the ON orientation at all time points at both the center and edge ( Fig 5C , top ) . In contrast , flg OFF bacteria from the center contained the switch primarily in the OFF configuration , but bacteria at the leading edge had the switch to the ON orientation by 24 hours ( Fig 5C , bottom ) . The flg ON orientation was subsequently preserved along the leading edge at 48 and 72 hours ( Fig 5C , bottom ) . These results indicate that growth in motility medium introduced a selection barrier that restricted flg OFF bacteria to the inoculation site and allowed the expansion of a low frequency population of flg ON bacteria . The flagellar alternative sigma factor , \u03c3D , controls transcription of genes within the Pathogenicity Locus ( PaLoc ) in addition to late stage flagellar genes in C . difficile [22 , 23 , 44] . Therefore , we predicted that the flagellar switch , which impacts the expression of sigD ( Fig 4B ) , also indirectly controls the expression of the toxin genes tcdA and tcdB by activating the expression of the toxin sigma factor gene tcdR . We compared the expression of tcdA , tcdB and tcdR in flg ON and OFF isolates using qRT-PCR . The abundances of the tcdR , tcdA and tcdB transcripts were significantly reduced in flg OFF bacteria compared to flg ON ( Fig 6A ) . Consistent with these results , TcdA protein level was also decreased in cell lysates of flg OFF bacteria compared to lysates of flg ON bacteria ( Fig 6B ) . TcdB levels were below the limit of detection by western blot . TcdA and TcdB are exported protein toxins that inactivate host cell Rho and Rac GTPases through glucosylation , resulting in actin depolymerization and reduced host cell viability [13\u201316] . To determine the effect of the flagellar switch on C . difficile cytotoxicity , filter-sterilized supernatants from flg ON and OFF isolates were tested in a cell viability assay with Vero cells . Flg ON isolates were significantly more cytotoxic compared to flg OFF isolates and a sigD control ( Fig 6C ) . Taken together , these data demonstrate that the flagellar switch orientation controls toxin production in addition to flagellum biosynthesis and swimming motility , indicating that these major virulence factors are coordinately phase variable in C . difficile . Multiple mechanisms driving phase variable gene expression have been described: general homologous recombination , conservative site-specific recombination , short sequence repeat and slip strand mispairing , and DNA methylation [66 , 74 , 75] . Classically , an invertible DNA element that undergoes site-specific recombination contains a promoter as the regulatory feature , and the orientation of the invertible DNA element ( and promoter ) determines whether the downstream genes are expressed . For example , in E . coli the orientation of the fimS switch , which contains a promoter , controls type I fimbrial gene expression [76] . In contrast , in C . difficile , the genetic switch that regulates expression of cwpV operates after transcription initiation [68] . In cwpV phase ON bacteria , transcriptional read-through of the 5\u2019 UTR and the cwpV coding sequence occurs . In cwpV phase OFF bacteria , the inversion of a DNA sequence in the 5\u2019 UTR leads to formation of a Rho-independent transcriptional terminator and results in premature transcription termination preventing expression of cwpV . To begin to define the mechanism by which the flagellar switch controls gene expression , we generated a series of alkaline phosphatase ( AP ) transcriptional reporters ( Fig 7A ) [77] . First , the phoZ reporter gene was placed downstream of flgB ( first gene of the flgB operon ) , under the control of the native flgB promoter and the full 498 bp 5\u2019 UTR with the flagellar switch ( FS ) in either the phase ON or OFF orientation ( PflgB-5\u2019UTR ( FSON/OFF ) -flgB::phoZ , Fig 7A , #3 & 4 ) . To determine if the flagellar switch contains a promoter , a truncated 307 bp 5\u2019 UTR retaining the flagellar switch ( either phase ON or OFF orientation ) but lacking the Cd1 riboswitch and native flgB promoter was placed upstream of flgB::phoZ ( FSON/OFF-flgB::phoZ , Fig 7A , #5 & 6 ) . A transcriptional fusion of phoZ to the flgB promoter ( PflgB::phoZ , Fig 7A , #2 ) served as a positive control for the assay , and a promoterless construct ( ::phoZ , Fig 7A , #1 ) was included as a negative control . All reporter fusions were integrated onto the chromosome of an R20291 flg ON isolate , and AP activity was assessed . In parallel with every AP assay , an asymmetric PCR-digestion assay was performed to ensure that the flagellar switches were in the expected orientation for both the native locus and the reporter fusion ( S6 Fig ) . As anticipated , the promoterless control showed no AP activity , and the presence of the flgB promoter significantly increased activity ( Fig 7B ) . The PflgB-5\u2019UTR ( FSOFF ) -flgB::phoZ reporter strain had significantly reduced activity compared to the PflgB-5\u2019UTR ( FSON ) -flgB::phoZ reporter strain ( Fig 7B ) , consistent with previous results ( Fig 4 ) . No AP activity was detected in strains bearing the FSON/OFF-flgB::phoZ fusions ( Fig 7B ) . Similar results were obtained using the same six reporter fusions integrated onto the chromosome of a R20291 with the native flagellar switch in the OFF orientation , although AP activity was lower overall ( S7 Fig ) . These results suggest that the flagellar switch does not contain a promoter to initiate transcription independently of the flgB promoter . We considered alternative mechanisms by which expression could be inhibited in bacteria with the switch in the OFF orientation: ( 1 ) the formation of a Rho-independent transcriptional terminator , ( 2 ) the requirement for a trans-acting element such as an RNA binding protein or small non-coding RNA that selectively inhibits transcription , or ( 3 ) a Rho-dependent terminator . To examine these possibilities , we evaluated the activity of the phoZ reporters in a heterologous bacterium , B . subtilis , in which C . difficile-specific factors will be absent , but features inherent to the flagellar switch will be preserved . The reporter fusions ( Fig 7A ) were integrated into the B . subtilis BS49 chromosome , and the orientation of the flagellar switch was monitored by orientation-specific PCR ( S6 Fig ) . As in C . difficile , the positive control strain with the PflgB::phoZ fusion showed high AP activity , but no activity was observed for the::phoZ negative control ( Fig 7B ) . Also consistent with C . difficile , B . subtilis with the FSON/OFF-flgB::phoZ fusions produced negligible AP activity , indicating the absence of a promoter in the flagellar switch ( Fig 7C ) . In contrast to the C . difficile results , we observed comparable AP activity in B . subtilis with PflgB-5\u2019UTR ( FSON/OFF ) -flgB::phoZ reporters ( Fig 7C ) . Thus , reduced gene expression as a result of the flagellar switch in the OFF orientation is specific to C . difficile , indicating that the regulatory feature is not inherent to the sequence , instead supporting the role of a trans-acting factor that is specific to C . difficile . When considered along with the qRT-PCR data from Figs 4B and 6A , these results suggest regulation post-transcription initiation from the flgB operon promoter and implicates changes in RNA stability or premature termination . Therefore , we used northern blot analysis to determine if transcription terminates prematurely or if the transcript is destabilized when the flagellar switch is in the OFF orientation . We were unable to detect the full-length transcript for the flgB operon ( ~ 23 kb ) using a probe specific to the Cd1 region of the 5\u2019 UTR , so we used strains with the PflgB-5\u2019UTR ( FSON/OFF ) -flgB::phoZ reporters in the R20291 flg ON background to evaluate premature transcription termination . We observed an RNA corresponding to a full-length transcript of ~2400 nt for the PflgB-5\u2019UTR ( FSON ) -flgB::phoZ reporter but reduced transcript for the PflgB-5\u2019UTR ( FSOFF ) -flgB::phoZ reporter ( Fig 7D ) . Furthermore , we did not detect a smaller transcript species other than termination through the Cd1 riboswitch , which eliminates the possibility of Rho-dependent or -independent termination unless the transcript is degraded faster than we can detect by northern blot . Collectively , the reporter assays in C . difficile flg ON and OFF and in B . subtilis with northern blot analysis suggest that regulation via the flagellar switch occurs post-transcription initiation and involves an unidentified trans-acting element that destabilizes the mRNA to reduce gene expression in flg OFF bacteria . Serine and tyrosine recombinases catalyze site-specific recombination to mediate DNA inversion at phase variable genetic switches in a RecA-independent manner [78 , 79] . In E . coli , two recombinases catalyze inversion at the fimbrial switch; FimB can catalyze both orientations , whereas FimE is restricted to ON to OFF inversion events [80 , 81] . A conserved tyrosine recombinase called RecV catalyzes strand exchange in both orientations at the cwpV switch in C . difficile [68 , 82\u201384] . We postulated that the recombinase ( s ) which catalyze inversion at the flg switch would be present in all published C . difficile genomes with intact flagellum biosynthesis genes . We identified eight conserved serine or tyrosine recombinases , including RecV ( CDR20291_1004 ) , and used a two-plasmid system in a heterologous bacterium to identify the flagellar switch recombinase ( s ) [68] . One plasmid contains one of the eight recombinase genes cloned downstream of an anhydrotetracycline ( ATc ) inducible promoter [85] , and the second plasmid contains one of the PflgB-5\u2019UTR ( FSON/OFF ) -flgB::phoZ reporters ( Fig 7A , #3 & 4 ) . The plasmids were transformed into E . coli , induced with ATc , and orientation-specific PCR was used on purified plasmids to determine if inversion occurred . We found that RecV was sufficient to catalyze recombination of the flagellar switch from the ON to OFF ( Fig 8A ) and OFF to ON ( Fig 8B ) orientations in E . coli; the other seven were unable to promote recombination . These data indicate that the RecV recombinase is sufficient to catalyze inversion in both orientations at both the flagellar and cwpV switches in a heterologous organism . These data do not rule out the possibility of an additional recombinase that requires a trans-acting element , such as a recombination directionality factor [86] , to catalyze inversion at the flagellar switch . To determine whether RecV is involved in inversion of the flagellar switch in C . difficile , we first overexpressed recV in the backgrounds of R20291 flg ON and OFF using the anhydrotetracycline ( ATc ) -inducible expression vector to determine whether RecV would promote inversion to the opposite orientation [87] . We found that overexpression of recV in the flg ON and OFF backgrounds leads to a mixed population of both orientations compared to empty vector , regardless of the presence of ATc ( S8 Fig , panel A ) . Transcription of recV in the ATc-inducible expression vector was leaky in the absence of inducer ( S8 Fig , panel B ) , which is in line with previous work [87 , 88] . The C . difficile R20291 recV mutants were previously shown to be phase-locked for CwpV production [83 , 84] . The identification of RecV as the recombinase mediating flagellar switch inversion suggests that mutation of recV would similarly result in phase-locked phenotypes with respect to flagellum and toxin production . To evaluate the requirement of RecV for flagellar phase variation in C . difficile , we obtained two C . difficile R20291 mutants with ClosTron insertions in recV ( kind gift from Dr . Louis-Charles Fortier ) . One mutant contains the cwpV switch locked in the ON orientation , and the other , the OFF orientation [82 , 83] . Both mutants contain the flagellar switch in the OFF orientation ( herein , \u201cflg OFF*\u201d ) , as determined using orientation-specific PCR ( Figs 1B and 8C ) . To obtain a recV mutant in which the flagellar switch is locked in the ON orientation , recV was expressed from a plasmid to allow inversion of the flagellar switch ( Fig 8C ) . This complemented strain was then passaged in the absence of antibiotic selection to allow loss of the plasmid . Thiamphenicol-sensitive clones were screened for flagellar switch orientation to identify recV mutants that are flg ON ( herein , \u201cflg ON*\u201d ) ( S9 Fig ) . The recV flg ON* and OFF* mutants , each bearing vector or recV under the control of the Ptet ATc-inducible promoter , were assayed for swimming motility in BHIS-0 . 3% agar . A non-motile sigD mutant and enriched flg ON and OFF isolates were included as controls . Unlike the enriched flg OFF isolate that appeared motile due to a small frequency of flg ON bacteria , the recV flg OFF* mutant was non-motile at 24 hours incubation ( Fig 9A and 9B ) . This phase-locked phenotype was dependent on RecV , as complementation with recV in trans restored motility . In contrast , the recV flg ON* mutant showed motility , and providing recV in trans had no measurable effect in this assay . We note that extended incubation ( greater than 24 hours ) of the recV flg OFF* mutant results in motile progeny ( S10 Fig ) . These motile bacteria retain the flagellar switch in the OFF orientation based on orientation-specific PCR and DNA sequencing results ( S10 Fig ) , so the motile phenotype is due to suppressor mutations . We next evaluated toxin production by the recV flg ON* and OFF* mutants by measuring TcdA production by western blot . As shown above , the enriched flg OFF isolate produced less TcdA than the enriched flg ON isolate ( Fig 9C , lanes 1 , 2 ) . TcdA levels were greater in the recV flg ON* mutant compared to the enriched flg ON isolate . The difference is likely attributable to the presence of ~10 . 5% or 23 . 2% of bacteria with the flagellar switch in the OFF orientation remaining in the enriched flg ON isolate based on qPCR and fluorescence microscopy estimates , respectively ( Figs 3C and 4D ) . TcdA abundance in the recV flg OFF* mutant was comparable to that in the sigD mutant , which was below the limit of detection . Provision of recV in trans in either the recV flg ON* or OFF* mutant , which results in heterogeneity in the orientation of the flagellar switch ( Fig 8D ) , resulted in intermediate TcdA levels ( Fig 9C , lanes 5 , 7 ) . The observed differences in TcdA levels among the strains appear to depend on the proportion of flg ON and OFF bacteria in the population . These results indicate that RecV mediates flagellum and toxin phase variation , in addition to CwpV phase variation , in C . difficile . \n Colonization is a prerequisite step to diarrheal disease development in C . difficile infection . The identification of colonization factors and the mechanisms controlling their production is an active area of study . Transcriptional regulators [51\u201353] , a peptide-based quorum sensing system [29] , and an RNA chaperone [54] activate or repress flagellar gene expression , albeit the exact regulatory mechanisms remain undetermined . Prior to this study , Cd1 , a class I c-di-GMP sensing riboswitch , was the only identified cis-acting regulatory element to control flagellar gene expression [59 , 61 , 62] . Here , we report an additional cis-acting regulatory element , a \u201cflagellar switch , \u201d present upstream of the early stage flagellar operon . The flagellar switch is the fourth identified C . difficile inversion site ( Cdi4 ) and consists of a 154 bp sequence flanked by 21 bp imperfect inverted repeats [69] . The flagellar switch is functional , undergoing site-specific recombination in at least two different C . difficile ribotypes , 027 and 017 . The flagellar switch inverted repeats are conserved in all sequenced C . difficile genomes that contain the flagellum biosynthesis genes , except the 630 genome has shortened 20 bp inverted repeats ( S11 Fig ) . The flagellar switch appears locked ON in C . difficile 630 , which may be due to the shortened inverted repeats . Alternatively , the 630 genome ( 012 ribotype ) may differ in RecV transcription , production , or activity compared to the 027 and 017 ribotype strains , although there are no obvious differences in the recV promoter or open reading frame sequences to indicate that this is the case . Genetic evidence suggests that reduced inverted repeat length can impair recombination at the cwpV switch in C . difficile [68] . The cwpV switch ( Cdi1 ) controls the production of a large cell wall protein that promotes bacterial aggregation in vitro and is postulated to promote intestinal colonization [68 , 82] . CwpV may also contribute to C . difficile survival in the host by conferring resistance to predation by bacteriophages [84] . Deposition of CwpV on the surface of C . difficile reduces phage adsorption and specifically prevents the injection of phage DNA into the bacterial cell [84] . The other two identified inversion sites in C . difficile , although not yet demonstrated to be functional switches , are under active investigation . Unlike the cwpV switch that controls the expression of a single structural gene , the flagellar switch controls the expression of both structural and regulatory genes , including sigD . Flagellar phase ON bacteria , as well as a recV mutant with the flagellar switch locked in the ON orientation , display peritrichous flagella , engage in swimming motility , and produce the glucosylating toxins . Flagellar phase OFF bacteria and recV mutants with the flagellar switch locked in the OFF orientation are attenuated for transcription of flagellar genes , and therefore grow as aflagellate , non-motile bacteria also attenuated for toxin production . Thus , the flagellar switch coordinately controls the production of a colonization factor and essential virulence determinants by impacting sigD expression . Moreover , the flagellar switch orientation is expected to affect additional genes in the \u03c3D regulon , such as metabolic pathways , multiple cell wall proteins , metabolic transporters for amino acids and divalent cations , and several transcriptional regulators [23] . Classically , genetic switches that toggle between two orientations and facilitate phase variable expression of downstream genes contain a promoter to alter transcription initiation [66] . Transcriptional reporter data excluded the presence of a promoter within the flagellar switch , indicating that the switch controls downstream gene expression after transcription initiation from the flgB operon promoter has occurred . Indeed , the switch is within the previously defined 5\u2019 UTR of the flgB ( F3 ) operon , downstream of the c-di-GMP riboswitch [62] . This arrangement of regulatory elements suggests that flagellar phase variation is only relevant when c-di-GMP levels are sufficiently low to permit transcriptional read-through beyond the riboswitch and into the flagellar switch . Regulation post-transcription initiation by genetic switches has been described previously . The cwpV switch in C . difficile also lacks promoter activity and instead regulates cwpV expression post-transcriptionally [68] . When the switch is in the cwpV phase OFF orientation , the mRNA adopts a structure containing a Rho-independent terminator resulting in premature transcription termination [68] . In E . coli , the fimE mRNA is subject to regulation post transcription initiation . FimE is encoded immediately 5\u2019 of fimS , and when fimS is in the OFF orientation , the fimE mRNA forms a Rho-dependent terminator that reduces transcript stability [89] . If the flagellar switch in C . difficile contained a Rho-independent terminator , we would expect no AP activity in B . subtilis when the flagellar switch was in the OFF orientation . However , AP activity was indistinguishable between the flg ON and OFF reporters in B . subtilis , suggesting a trans-acting regulatory element that is expressed only in C . difficile . We note that AP activity from the reporters was substantially higher in B . subtilis compared to C . difficile; it is possible that a regulatory factor in B . subtilis masked the unidentified trans-acting regulatory factor . Moreover , northern blot analysis suggests a mechanism independent of both Rho-dependent and independent termination since we were unable to detect a truncated transcript from the phase OFF condition . Collectively , our results suggest that the early stage flagellar operon mRNA is destabilized or degraded when the flagellar switch DNA is in the OFF orientation . We speculate that a constitutively-expressed C . difficile-specific regulatory factor , either an RNA binding protein or small , non-coding RNA , binds to the leader sequence of the mRNA to directly or indirectly degrade or destabilize the mRNA . Thus , the flagellar switch in C . difficile represents a novel system that requires an unknown additional regulatory factor to function as an ON/OFF switch . In many mucosal pathogens , phase variation is a regulatory feature that modulates the expression of an immunostimulatory cell surface structure [66] . Flagellar phase variation occurs in Clostridium chauvoei [90] , Salmonella enterica serovar enterica Typhimurium [91 , 92] , Helicobacter pylori [93] , and Campylobacter jejuni [94] . Wild strains of B . subtilis grown under planktonic conditions bifurcate into two distinct populations: flagellated , motile single bacteria and aflagellate , non-motile chains of bacteria [95] . Expression and activity of \u03c3D determines whether these populations arise in B . subtilis . Expression of swrA , which encodes a master regulator of swarming motility , is subject to phase variation by slip strand mispairing in the coding sequence [95\u201397] . SwrA controls transcription of the flagellar and chemotaxis ( fla/che ) operon by regulating the activity of the transcriptional regulator DegU [98] . SigD , encoded within the fla/che operon , also positively regulates swrA transcription [98] . Thus , a feedforward loop resulting from swrA expression introduces a bias for \u03c3D ON bacteria that are flagellated and motile . These and other data present a model in which flagellar gene expression in B . subtilis is bistable [97] . Although additional work is needed to determine if C . difficile flagellar gene expression meets the criteria of bistability [99\u2013101] , inversion of the C . difficile flagellar switch similarly results in phenotypic heterogeneity that would confer an advantage in an environment that selects for one phenotype over the other [99\u2013101] . Thus , B . subtilis and C . difficile may use distinct mechanisms to accomplish the same outcome . We identified RecV as necessary and sufficient for inversion of the flagellar switch in both orientations , by over-expression of recV in C . difficile and in E . coli bearing the flagellar switch sequence , and by mutation of recV in C . difficile R20291 . Notably , RecV was previously reported to control inversion of the cwpV switch in C . difficile [68 , 82] . The use of a single recombinase to control inversion of multiple genetic switches has been described previously . In Bacteroides fragilis , the Mpi recombinase controls inversion of at least 13 genetic switches , including seven switches that control expression of different capsular polysaccharide loci [102] . These switches are scattered through the genome and contain inverted repeats that harbor a 10 bp core consensus sequence [102] . In contrast , the inverted repeats and the flanking half sites for the cwpV and flagellar switches lack recognizable sequence identity , although the identification of additional RecV-controlled genetic switches might reveal a core consensus sequence . RecV may bind the recognition sequences with different affinities , allowing hierarchical inversion of switches bearing disparate inverted repeats . Regulation of recV transcription and/or RecV activity could therefore differentially affect inversion of the cwpV and flagellar switches . Hierarchical binding could be achieved solely by RecV , or via additional proteins that direct RecV to specific target sequences . The need for these binding partners may have been bypassed in E . coli due to over-expression of recV . It is also possible that trans-acting DNA binding proteins , such as a histone-like protein or recombination directionality factor ( RDF ) [86 , 103] , influence DNA bending to affect the recombination reaction at RecV-controlled genetic switches . Such DNA binding proteins can integrate environmental signals to bias switch orientation and generate genetic variants that have a fitness advantage in that environment . For example , leucine-responsive regulatory protein and H-NS affect the recombination reaction at fimS in E . coli [104 , 105] . The existence of factors influencing RecV activity in C . difficile is supported by the observation that C . difficile R20291 carrying the prophage \u03d5CD38-2 has the cwpV switch biased to the ON orientation; recV transcription is unaltered [83] . Prophage infection of a recV mutant with the cwpV switch in the OFF orientation remains locked , suggesting that the phage does not encode a recombinase to promote inversion , but that instead a phage gene product modulates RecV activity [83] . \u03d5CD38-2 did not affect flagellum or toxin gene transcription in R20291 , but C . difficile may produce another factor that similarly influences recombination within the flagellar ( and cwpV ) switch . Recent evidence demonstrates a role for RDFs in C . difficile physiology: an RDF pairs with a serine recombinase to excise a prophage-like element from a sporulation-specific sigma factor gene [106] . Future studies will explore how RecV can control multiple genetic switches with divergent inverted repeat sequences . Ultimately , iterative combinations of cwpV and flg ON and OFF phenotypes may influence C . difficile fitness in the host intestinal environment . A dual cwpV and flg ON phenotype could facilitate penetration of the bacteriophage-rich colonic mucus [107] , and/or increase bacterial attachment to and colonization of the intestinal mucosa . Conversion of one or both phenotypes to phase OFF might reduce the probability of the host simultaneously developing an antibody response to these immunostimulatory surface structures . The role of flagellum and toxin phase variation in C . difficile pathogenesis remains to be determined , though it stands to reason that both the phase ON and OFF phenotypes confer advantages during the course of an infection . The flg ON bacteria would be competent for efficient intestinal colonization for R20291 [31] . Yet purified flagellin from multiple C . difficile strains can activate host Toll-like receptor 5 ( TLR5 ) and stimulate p38 MAPK activation and IL-8 secretion in vitro [47 , 108 , 109] . Although TLR5 is dispensable in a mouse model of CDI [49] , recombinant C . difficile FliC is immunogenic and protective in a mouse model of CDI [110] . In addition , the C . difficile glucosylating toxins have been implicated in activation of the NLRP3 and Pyrin inflammasomes , which could promote pathogen clearance [48 , 111] . C . difficile flg OFF bacteria could thus evade TLR5 recognition and inflammasome stimulation , enhancing bacterial colonization and persistence within the host . Future studies will determine the contribution of flagellum and toxin phase variation to C . difficile virulence . \n The strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in S1 Table , and details on their construction are in S1 Methods . C . difficile was maintained in an anaerobic chamber ( Coy Laboratories ) at an atmosphere of 90% N2 , 5% CO2 , and 5% H2 and grown in Brain Heart Infusion medium ( Becton Dickinson ) supplemented with 5% yeast extract ( Becton Dickinson ) ( BHIS ) at 37\u00b0C . Bacteria were also cultured in Tryptone Yeast ( TY ) broth media where indicated . All C . difficile broth cultures were grown statically . Escherichia coli DH5\u03b1 , BL21 , and HB101 ( pRK24 ) were cultured at 37\u00b0C in Luria-Bertani ( LB ) medium with the indicated antibiotics for plasmid selection . Bacillus subtilis strain BS49 was grown in BHIS with the appropriate antibiotics . Antibiotics were used at the following concentrations: chloramphenicol , 10 \u03bcg/ml; thiamphenicol , 10 \u03bcg/ml; kanamycin , 100 \u03bcg/ml; ampicillin , 100 \u03bcg/ml; erythromycin , 5 . 0 \u03bcg/ml , lincomycin 20 . 0 \u03bcg/ml . Spores of C . difficile strains 630\u0394erm , R20291 , and ATCC 43598 were plated on BHIS supplemented with 0 . 1% sodium taurocholate ( Sigma ) ( BHIS+TA ) . After 24 hours , individual colonies were grown in BHIS at 37\u00b0C . Overnight cultures were diluted 1:50 in fresh BHIS and grown to early stationary phase . An aliquot of each culture was diluted 1:5 into 10 mM Tris-HCl , pH 7 . 5 , 1 mM EDTA ( TE ) buffer . Boiled lysates served as templates in PCR using primers designed for each strain based the genome sequences for strains 630 ( Accession No . AM180355 . 1 ) and R20291 ( Accession No . FN545816 . 1 ) . The ribotype 017 strain ATCC 43598 has not been sequenced , so we used M68 ( Accession No . FN688375 . 1 ) as a representative ribotype 017 strain to design primers for the flagellar switch . Primer sequences are listed in S2 Table . Primers R1614 ( published/ON orientation ) and R1615 ( inverse/OFF orientation ) were used for R20291 . Primers R1622 ( published/ON orientation ) and R1623 ( inverse/OFF orientation ) were used for ATCC 43598 . Primers R1751 ( published/ON orientation ) and R1752 ( inverse/OFF orientation ) were used for 630\u0394erm . All reactions used R857 as the reverse primer given the sequence identity between strains for the first gene in the early flagellar operon , flgB . The results shown are representative of three independent experiments each with at least two biological replicates for each strain . To amplify the flagellar switch , chromosomal DNA purified from C . difficile R20291 , as previously described [112] , served as the template in PCRs with primers R591 and R857 , yielding a product of 665bp . The PCR products ( 500 ng ) were digested with SwaI ( NEB ) , which results in different products depending on the orientation of the flagellar switch: 312 bp and 353 bp for the published orientation , and 418 bp and 247 bp for the inverse orientation ( Fig 2 ) . A mixture of bacteria with the flagellar switch in the published and inverse orientation results in four bands at varying intensities . SwaI reaction products were separated in 2 . 5% agarose gels , which were stained with ethidium bromide ( EtBr ) for imaging with a G:BOX Chemi Imaging system . For all experiments with purified phase variant populations , three or four biological replicates of R20291 flg ON and OFF were assessed by the asymmetric PCR-digest assay to ensure a homogeneous population . We used ImageJ to perform a densitometry analysis of the digested bands to determine the relative proportions of bacteria with flagellar switch in the published/ON ( 312 , 353 bp ) and inverse/OFF ( 418 , 247 bp ) orientations . The pixel intensities of published/ON or inverse/OFF bands were divided by the total pixel intensity for that sample . These values were normalized to a standard curve generated by mixing known quantities of flg ON and OFF plasmid template and subjecting them to the asymmetric PCR-digestion assay , giving the percentage of bacteria in a sample with the switch in a given orientation . To evaluate the effect of surface growth on the flagellar switch , C . difficile R20291 spores were plated on BHIS-TA to induce germination . After 24 hours , individual colonies were suspended and spotted onto four BHIS plates . Every 24 hours for four days , one plate was used for recovery of bacteria from colony for chromosomal DNA extraction . Once chromosomal DNA was collected , the orientation of the flagellar switch was determined using the asymmetric PCR-digestion assay . Densitometry analysis was performed using ImageJ software as described above . Values for bands corresponding to the published/ON and inverse/OFF orientations were compared to a standard curve . The data were combined from three independent experiments , each with two to four biological replicates . C . difficile R20291 spores were plated on BHIS+TA . After 24 hours , six to ten individual colonies were suspended in BHIS , spotted onto individual BHIS plates , and grown 24\u201396 hours as indicated . Single colonies were derived from this growth ( 24\u201396 hours ) by passaging onto BHIS plates and individually screened for the flagellar switch orientation by the asymmetric PCR digestion assay . A higher frequency of colonies with the flagellar switch in the OFF orientation was observed at later time points ( 96 hours ) . For all experiments using enriched flagellar phase variant populations , except the phoZ reporters , mCherry reporters , and cell viability assay , glycerol stocks were not made to ensure robust reproducibility of the phenotypes between independent experiments and reproducibility of the enrichment protocol . At least two to four biological replicates of flg phase ON and OFF populations were used for all experiments . In all reactions , SYBR Green Real-Time qPCR reagents ( Thermo Fisher ) were used , with primers at a final concentration of 500 nM and an annealing temperature of 55\u00b0C . Titrated amounts of genomic DNA from recV flg ON* and flg OFF* were used to determine the amount of template necessary for the reactions and the primer efficiency . Primers for detection of the ON orientation ( R2175 and R2177 ) had a PCR efficiency of 88 . 5% for the recV flg ON* DNA , and the primers for detection of the OFF orientation ( R2176 and R2177 ) had a PCR efficiency of 84 . 5% for the recV flg OFF* DNA . To determine the frequency of the flg ON and OFF orientations in populations of enriched C . difficile R20291 flg ON and OFF isolates , three biological replicates of each were grown in BHIS medium to an OD600 of ~1 . 0 , and chromosomal DNA was extracted as previously described [112] . Quantitative PCR was done using 4 ng of DNA from flg ON and OFF isolates . DNA copy number was calculated using the \u0394\u0394Ct method , with the rpoC gene as the indicated reference gene for DNA copy number .

Real-time PCRs were done using 2 ng of cDNA and SYBR Green Real-Time qPCR reagents ( Thermo Fisher ) . Transcript abundance was calculated using the \u0394\u0394Ct method , with rpoC as the control gene and the indicated reference condition/strain [59] . C . difficile R20291 , flg ON and OFF isolates , and recV mutants were assayed for flagellar motility as previously described [59] . An R20291 sigD mutant was included as a non-motile control in all experiments . Details regarding the generation of the sigD mutant are in S1 Methods and S5 Fig . Autoclaved 0 . 5 X BHIS with 0 . 3% agar ( 30 mL ) was poured into 100 mm Petri dishes allowed to solidify overnight . These soft agar plates were kept in the anaerobic chamber for at least 4 hours prior to the experiment . Bacteria were grown in BHIS medium overnight , diluted 1:50 in fresh BHIS broth the next day , and grown to an OD600 of 1 . 0 . Two microliters of flg ON , flg OFF , and sigD were inoculated into the agar , then incubated at 37\u00b0C . The diameter of growth was measured after 24 , 48 , and 72 hours; two perpendicular measurements were made for each swim site and averaged for each replicate . Three to four biological replicates were evaluated , each in technical duplicate ( values averaged ) , in two independent experiments . Images were taken using the G:BOX Chemi imaging system with the Upper White Light illuminator . A Student\u2019s t-test was used to determine statistical significance .

After 24 hours , 2\u20133 colonies of each reporter strains were grown overnight in TY medium and diluted 1:50 into BHIS medium . Late exponential phase cells ( OD600 \u2248 1 . 5 , 1 . 5 mL ) were collected by centrifugation , the supernatant was discarded , and pellets were stored at -20\u00b0C overnight . Frozen pellets were thawed on ice and the alkaline phosphatase ( AP ) assay was performed as previously described [77] .

Construction of AP reporters is described in S1 Methods . C . difficile phoZ reporter strains were grown in 4mL of BHIS medium to OD600 1 . 5 . Bacteria were collected by centrifugation , and RNA was extracted as described above with the following exceptions . Four rounds of bead beating were done , and the purified RNA was rigorously treated with DNase I to ensure removal of contaminating DNA . Digoxigenin ( DIG ) -labeled DNA probes for the northern blot were generated by PCR using genomic DNA from R20291 as template for the Cd1 probe and a 5S rRNA ( CDR20291_ r03 ) probe , a DIG High Prime kit was used ( Roche ) ( S1 Table ) . Reagents from the NorthernMax-Gly Kit ( Thermo Fisher ) were used for electrophoresis and hybridization . RNA samples ( 15ug for mRNA probe and 500ng for rRNA probe ) were briefly thawed on ice , mixed 1:1 with Glyoxal Load Dye , incubated at 50\u00b0C for 30 minutes , and electrophoresed in a 1% agarose gel made with 1X Gel Prep/Running Buffer . The agarose gel was imaged using the G:BOX Chemi Imaging system to confirm RNA integrity . The gel was briefly soaked in 20X SSC ( 3M NaCl and 300mM sodium citrate ) , then RNA was transferred via capillary action onto a nylon membrane ( Amersham Hybond-N+ ) overnight in 20X SSC for 16 hours . RNA was crosslinked to the membrane using a UV Stratalinker 1800 ( Stratagene ) . After prehybridization with ULTRAhyb buffer at 42\u00b0C for 1 hr , 4 \u03bcL of a DIG-labeled DNA probe specific to the Cd1 riboswitch or the 5S rRNA loading control gene was added . After 16 hours , the membrane washed in low and high stringency buffers sequentially ( NorthernMax-Gly Kit ) . To detect the DIG-labeled probes on the membrane , we used the buffers and followed the manufacturer\u2019s instructions in the DIG High Prime DNA Labeling and Detection Starter Kit II ( Roche ) and the chemiluminescent substrate CDP-Star ( Roche ) . Membranes were exposed to film , which was then imaged using a developer . C . difficile was grown as patches on BHIS agar for 24 hours . The patches were thoroughly suspended in BHIS , and cell densities were normalized to an OD600 1 . 0\u20131 . 5 . The cells were again pelleted by centrifugation and then suspended in 1X SDS-PAGE sample buffer [113] and heated at 95\u00b0C for 10 minutes . The lysates were separated on an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane ( Bio-Rad ) . TcdA was detected using a mouse \u03b1-TcdA primary antibody ( Novus Biologicals ) and goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated with IR800 ( Thermo Fisher ) as described previously [44] . Detection was done using a LI-COR Odyssey Imager ( LI-COR Biosciences ) . Three independent experiments were done , each with three to four biological replicates of flg ON and OFF isolates . Vero cells were seeded in 96 well plates at 8 , 000 cells per well in DMEM ( Life Technologies ) supplemented with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum ( Sigma ) ( DMEM-FBS ) and 1X Penicillin/Streptomycin ( Life Technologies ) for 16 hours . C . difficile R20291 flg ON and OFF isolates , and a sigD mutant control , were grown on BHIS plates for 16\u201324 hours . Four colonies of each isolate/strain were grown in TY medium overnight , then diluted 1:50 into fresh TY and grown to stationary phase ( OD600 \u2248 2 . 0 ) . Cultures were normalized to the same OD600 . Bacteria were removed by centrifugation , and supernatants were collected , filter sterilized ( 0 . 45 micron ) , and serially diluted in TY medium . For each well with Vero cells , the cell culture medium was replaced with fresh DMEM-FBS . Supernatants were added in the following dilutions with cell culture media: 1:4 , 1:40 , 1:80 , 1:400 , and 1:800 . As a negative control , Vero cells were treated with TY medium at a 1:4 dilution in DMEM-FBS . After 24 hours at 37\u00b0C , the medium was carefully removed by aspiration , and 100 \u03bcL each of cell culture medium and Promega CellTiter Glo reagent were added to each well . After 10 minutes at room temperature on a shaker , Vero cell lysates were transferred to opaque-walled 96 well plates . Luminescence was measured using a Synergy H1 Hybrid plate reader with Gen5 software ( BioTek ) . Data were combined from two independent experiments each with four biological replicates of each isolate/strain . Relevant E . coli strains are listed in S1 Table . Bacteria were passaged onto LB plates with ampicillin 50 \u03bcg/mL and kanamycin 50 \u03bcg/mL and grown overnight for single colonies . Bacteria were inoculated into LB with the above-mentioned antibiotics to grow overnight at 30\u00b0C , diluted 1:50 into fresh medium in duplicates , and grown to an OD600 0 . 4 . Anhydrotetracycline ( ATc ) was added to a biological replicate for each flagellar switch/recombinase pair at a final concentration of 200 ng/mL , grown until OD600 1 . 0 , and plasmids were purified using the GeneJET Plasmid Miniprep Kit ( Thermo Fisher ) . Purified plasmids were used as template in an orientation-specific PCR assay to identify the recombinase that catalyzes inversion from ON to OFF and OFF to ON . For transmission electron microscopy , C . difficile flg ON and OFF populations were isolated on BHIS agar plates as described above and briefly washed in Dulbecco\u2019s PBS ( Sigma ) prior to suspension in PBS-4% paraformaldehyde for fixation for 1 hour in the anaerobic chamber . Cell suspensions were adsorbed onto Formvar/copper grids , washed in water , and stained for 30 seconds in two sequential drops of 1 . 5% aqueous uranyl acetate . Cells were observed on a LEO EM 910 Transmission Electron Microscope ( Carl Zeiss Microscopy , LLC , Thornword , NY ) and recorded with a Gatan Orius SC1000 digital camera with Digital Micrograph 3 . 11 . 0 software ( Gatan , Inc . , Pleaston , CA ) . To image bacterial colony morphology , we used a Zeiss Stereo Discovery V8 dissecting microscope with a glass stage for illumination of bacterial colonies with light from the top and bottom . For fluorescence microscopy , C . difficile enriched flg ON and OFF isolates and the sigD mutant bearing mCherryOpt reporter fusions ( S1 Table ) were cultured overnight in BHIS medium , diluted 1:50 in fresh BHIS medium , and grown to an OD600 of ~0 . 5 . For strains with the ATc-inducible mCherryOpt reporter ( pDSW1728 ) , 15 ng/mL of ATc was added to the culture at OD600 ~0 . 3 to induce transcription of the mCherryOpt gene . One milliliter of each culture was briefly pelleted in the anaerobic chamber , washed and suspended in phosphate buffered saline ( PBS ) , and fixed according to published methods in PBS and paraformaldehyde [73] .

{"lay_summary": "Endospores , as those formed by the anaerobic Clostridial species , the aerobic Bacillus and related organisms , are highly resilient dormant cell types . Endospore development has been extensively studied in Bacillus subtilis . The process starts with an asymmetric division that forms a larger mother cell and a smaller forespore . Gene expression in these two cells is primarily governed by four cell type-specific RNA polymerase sigma factors , two active sequentially in the mother cell and two active sequentially in the forespore . The precise timing of sigma factor activation is coordinated between the mother cell and forespore by several mechanisms . By combining studies of gene expression at the single cell level with the phenotypic characterization of mutants for the sigma genes , we describe the regulation of gene expression during endospore development by the intestinal pathogen C . difficile . In this organism , the endospore is the vehicle for transmission and persistence in the host and the environment . The overall picture that emerges is of a developmental program in which the coordination of gene expression between the forespore and mother cell is less tight than in B . subtilis , in what may be a general feature of endospore formation in the more ancient Clostridia group of bacteria .", "article": "Endosporulation is an ancient bacterial developmental program that culminates with the differentiation of a highly resistant endospore . In the model organism Bacillus subtilis , gene expression in the forespore and in the mother cell , the two cells that participate in endospore development , is governed by cell type-specific RNA polymerase sigma subunits . \u03c3F in the forespore , and \u03c3E in the mother cell control early stages of development and are replaced , at later stages , by \u03c3G and \u03c3K , respectively . Starting with \u03c3F , the activation of the sigma factors is sequential , requires the preceding factor , and involves cell-cell signaling pathways that operate at key morphological stages . Here , we have studied the function and regulation of the sporulation sigma factors in the intestinal pathogen Clostridium difficile , an obligate anaerobe in which the endospores are central to the infectious cycle . The morphological characterization of mutants for the sporulation sigma factors , in parallel with use of a fluorescence reporter for single cell analysis of gene expression , unraveled important deviations from the B . subtilis paradigm . While the main periods of activity of the sigma factors are conserved , we show that the activity of \u03c3E is partially independent of \u03c3F , that \u03c3G activity is not dependent on \u03c3E , and that the activity of \u03c3K does not require \u03c3G . We also show that \u03c3K is not strictly required for heat resistant spore formation . In all , our results indicate reduced temporal segregation between the activities of the early and late sigma factors , and reduced requirement for the \u03c3F-to-\u03c3E , \u03c3E-to-\u03c3G , and \u03c3G-to-\u03c3K cell-cell signaling pathways . Nevertheless , our results support the view that the top level of the endosporulation network is conserved in evolution , with the sigma factors acting as the key regulators of the pathway , established some 2 . 5 billion years ago upon its emergence at the base of the Firmicutes Phylum . \n Endosporulation is an ancient bacterial cell differentiation program that culminates with the formation of a highly resistant dormant cell , the endospore . Bacterial endospores ( hereinafter designated spores for simplicity ) , as those formed by species of the well-known Bacillus and Clostridium genera , but also by many other groups within the Firmicutes phylum , resist to extremes of physical and chemical parameters that would rapidly destroy the vegetative cells , and are the most resistant cellular structure known [1] , [2] . Their resilience allows them to accumulate in highly diverse environmental settings , often for extremely long periods of time . The range of environments occupied by sporeformers , include niches within metazoan hosts , in particular the gastro-intestinal tract ( GIT ) ( e . g . [3]\u2013[5] ) . B . subtilis , for example , a non-pathogenic sporeformer , can go through several cycles of growth , sporulation and germination in the GIT [5] . For pathogenic sporeformers , spores are often the infectious vehicle as in the inhalational or gastric forms of anthrax , the potentially lethal disease caused by B . anthracis [6] . Also , it is a protein present at the spore surface that mediates spore internalization by macrophages , and spore dissemination to local lymph nodes , which are central to pathogenesis [6] , [7] . Infection by the intestinal human and animal pathogen C . difficile , an obligate anaerobe , and the subject of the present investigation , often also starts with the ingestion of spores [8] , [9] . C . difficile is the causative agent of an intestinal disease whose symptoms can range from mild diarrhea to severe , potentially lethal inflammatory lesions such as pseudomembraneous colitis , toxic megacolon or bowel perforation [8] , [10] . Ingested spores of this organism germinate in the colon , to establish a population of vegetative cells that will produce two potent cytotoxins and more spores [8] , [10]\u2013[12] . Infection develops because C . difficile can colonize the gut if the normal intestinal microbiota is disturbed [8] [9] . Toxinogenesis is responsible for most of the disease symptoms , whereas the spores , which can remain latent in the gut , are both a persistence and transmission factor [8] , [10]\u2013[13] . While an asporogeneous mutant of C . difficile can cause intestinal disease , it is unable to persist within and transmit between host organism [13] . The spore thus has a central role in persistence of the organism in the environment , infection , recurrence and transmission of the disease . Recent years have seen the emergence of strains , so called hypervirulent , linked to increased incidence of severe disease , higher relapse rates and mortality , and C . difficile is now both a main nosocomial pathogen associated with antibiotic therapy as well as a major concern in the community [8] , [9] , [14] . The basic spore plan is conserved [15]\u2013[17] . The genome is deposited in a central compartment delimited by a lipid bilayer with a layer of peptidoglycan ( PG ) apposed to its external leaflet . This layer of PG , known as the germ cell wall , will serve as the wall of the outgrowing cell that forms when the spore completes germination . The germ cell wall is encased in a thick layer of a modified form of PG , the cortex , essential for the acquisition and maintenance of heat resistance [15] , [16] . The cortex is wrapped by a multiprotein coat , which protects it from the action of PG-breaking enzymes produced by host organisms or predators [15] , [16] . In some species , including the pathogens B . anthracis , B . cereus and C . difficile , the coat is further enclosed within a structure known as the exosporium . The coat and the exosporium , when present , mediate the immediate interactions of the spore with the environment , including the interaction with small molecules that trigger germination [7] , [15] , [18]\u2013[20] . The process of spore differentiation has been extensively studied in the model organism B . subtilis [21] [22] . Rod-shaped vegetative cells , growing by binary fission , will switch to an asymmetric ( polar ) division when facing severe nutritional stress . Polar division yields a larger mother cell and a smaller forespore , the future spore . The mother cell then engulfs the forespore . This process , akin to phagocytosis and a hallmark of endosporulation , isolates the forespore from the surrounding medium , and releases it as a cell , surrounded by a double membrane , within the mother cell cytoplasm [21] , [22] . With the exception of the germ cell wall , which is formed from the forespore , the assembly of the main spore protective structures is mostly a function of the mother cell [15] , [16] . At the end of the process , and following a period of spore maturation , the mother cell undergoes autolysis , to release the finished spore . For the organisms that have been studied to date , mostly by transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) , this basic sequence of morphological events appears conserved [15] , [21] . The developmental regulatory network of sporulation shows a hierarchical organization and functional logic [17] . A master regulatory protein , Spo0A , activated by phosphorylation , governs entry into sporulation , including the switch to asymmetric division [21] , [23] . Gene expression in the forespore and mother cell is controlled by 4 cell type-specific sigma factors , which are sequentially activated , alternating between the two cells . \u03c3F and \u03c3E control the early stages of development in the forespore and the mother cell , respectively , and are replaced by \u03c3G and \u03c3K when engulfment of the forespore is completed [21]\u2013[23] . Activation of the sporulation sigma factors coincides with the completion of key morphological intermediates in the process , at which stages cell-cell signaling events further allow the alignment of the forespore and mother cell programs of gene expression . The result is the coordinated deployment of the forespore and mother cell lines of gene expression , in close register with the course of cellular morphogenesis [21]\u2013[23] . Additional regulatory proteins , working with the sigma factors , generate feed forward loops ( FFLs ) that create waves of gene expression , minimizing transcriptional noise and impelling morphogenesis forward [17] . A large number of genes of B . subtilis , distributed in the four cell type-specific regulons , participate in spore morphogenesis [24]\u2013[27] . The key regulatory factors , Spo0A and the sporulation sigma factors , which define the highest level in the functional and evolutionary hierarchy of the sporulation network , are conserved in sporeformers . The FFLs show an intermediary level of conservation , with the \u201cstructural\u201d genes , with the lower level of conservation , at the lowest level in the hierarchy [17] , [24]\u2013[27] . The conservation of the sporulation sigma factors has suggested that their role and sequential activation is also maintained across species [17] . However , recent studies have revealed differences in the roles and time of activity of the sigma factors during spore morphogenesis in several Clostridial species [28]\u2013[35] . For instance , \u03c3F and \u03c3E are active prior to asymmetric division in C . acetobutylicum and C . perfringens [30] , [31] , [33] , [35] . Also , \u03c3K , which in B . subtilis controls late stages of morphogenesis in the mother cell , is active in pre-divisional cells of C . perfringens and C . botulinum [29] , [34] . Collectively , and relative to the aerobic Bacilli , the Clostridia represent an older group within the Firmicutes phylum , at the base of which endosporulation has emerged some 2 . 5 billion years ago , before the initial rise in oxygen levels [24]\u2013[28] , [36] . Despite the importance of C . difficile for human health and activities , and the central role of sporulation in the infection cycle , a cytological and molecular description of sporulation has been lacking . Here , we have combined cytological and genetics methodologies to define the sequence of sporulation events in C . difficile and the function of the cell type-specific sigma factors . In addition , by using a fluorescent reporter for studies of gene expression at the single cell level , we were able to correlate the expression and activity of the sporulation-specific sigma factors with the course of morphogenesis . A key observation is that during C . difficile sporulation the forespore and mother cell programs of gene expression are less tightly coupled . Our study also provides a platform for additional studies of the regulatory network and for integrating the expression and function of the effector genes , many of which will be species-specific , and possibly related to host colonization and transmission . \n Earlier studies using TEM have suggested that the main stages of sporulation are conserved amongst Bacillus and Clostridial species [37] . Here , we examined sporulation of C . difficile using phase contrast and fluorescence microscopy with the goal of establishing a platform for both the phenotypic analysis of mutants blocked in the process and for the analysis of developmental gene expression in relation to the course of morphogenesis . This approach requires the individual scoring of a relative large number of cells . However , under culturing conditions widely used for C . difficile sporulation , as in BHI medium , supplemented or not with cysteine and yeast extract ( BHIS ) , the process is highly heterogeneous , or asynchronous [11] , [14] , [38] , [39] , reviewed by [40] ) . High titers of spores have been reported following 48 h incubation of liquid cultures in the Sporulation Medium ( or SM ) described by Wilson and co-authors [41] , but how the spore titer developed over time was not reported . More recently , SM was used , with some modifications to the original formulation , for high yield spore production on agar plates [42] . We determined the spore titer during growth of the wild type strain 630\u0394erm in liquid SM cultures . As shown in Figure 1A , no heat resistant spores could be detected at the time of inoculation , or during the first 10 hours of growth . Heat resistant spores , 3 . 7\u00d7102 spores/ml , were first detected at hour 12 , a titer that increased to 2 . 4\u00d7105 at hour 24 ( about 14 hours after entry into the stationary phase of growth ) , the later number corresponding to a percentage of sporulation of 0 . 3% ( Figure 1A and Table S1 ) . From hour 24 onwards , the spore titer increased slowly , to reach 4 . 7\u00d7106 spores/ml 72 hours following inoculation , corresponding to 43 . 8% sporulation ( Figure 1A ) . Importantly , the percentage of sporulation in SM medium was higher than in BHI or BHIS for all the time points tested ( Figure S1 ) . In particular , the titer of spores in SM was two orders of magnitude higher than in BHIS , when measured 24 hours following inoculation ( Figure S1 ) . For our studies of spore morphogenesis and cell type-specific gene expression , SM was adopted . We then wanted to monitor progress through the morphological stages of sporulation by phase contrast and fluorescence microscopy . In a first experiment , a sample from cultures of the wild type strain 630\u0394erm was collected 24 hours after inoculation into SM , for microscopic examination following staining with the lipophilic membrane dye FM4-64 and with the DNA marker DAPI . Cells representative of several distinctive morphological classes are shown on Figure 1B ( top ) . Cells with straight asymmetrically positioned septa ( class a ) and cells with curved spore membranes ( i . e . , at intermediate stages in the engulfment sequence; class b ) , both showing intense staining of the forespore DNA , were readily seen ( Figure 1B ) . Another class comprised cells showing strong uniform FM4-64 staining around the entire contour of the forespore ( Figure 1B ) . The staining pattern suggests that the forespore is entirely surrounded by a double membrane , and therefore that the engulfment sequence was finalized . Those cells in which the forespore shows a continuous , strong FM4-64 signal , but has not yet developed partial or full refractility are considered to have just completed the engulfment process , and define class c . A strong , condensed DAPI signal in the forespore was also seen for this class ( Figure 1B ) . Intense , uniform staining of the forespore by FM4-64 was maintained in cells carrying phase grey ( partially refractile ) or phase bright spores , defining class d ( Figure 1B ) . DAPI staining of the forespore DNA was variable for both cells with phase grey or phase bright spores in this class ( data not shown ) . Free spores , at least some of which could be stained with DAPI , define a last morphological class ( class e ) ( Figure 1B ) . The stages of sporulation discerned conform well to the sequence established for B . subtilis ( Figure 1B , bottom ) [15] , [21] , [37] . Staining of the developing spore by FM4-64 following engulfment completion contrasts with the situation in B . subtilis , in which the lipophilic dye does not label engulfed forespores [43] ( see also Figure S2A ) . However , in other organisms , FM4-64 stains the engulfed forespore [3] ( see also Text S1 ) . Also , FM4-64 does not stain free spores of B . subtilis ( which do not have and exosporium ) or B . cereus ( which are surrounded by an exosporium ) ( Figure S2B ) , but stains C . difficile spores ( which also possess an exosporium ) ( Figure S3 ) . Spore staining by FM4-64 may thus be more related to the composition of the surface layers , rather than to the presence of a specific structure . We note that affinity of FM dyes to the spore coats has been reported [3] ( see also Text S1 ) . Under our culturing conditions , cells belonging to each of the five morphological classes considered ( a to e ) were seen at all the time points examined ( Figure 1C ) . This suggests that sporulation is heterogeneous , or asynchronous , in agreement with other results [43] , with cells entering the sporulation pathway throughout the duration of the experiment . Surprisingly , the representation of cells at intermediate stages in development ( classes a to c ) decreased from hour 36 to hour 48 , without a corresponding rise in later morphological classes ( class d , phase grey/bright spores and class e , free spores ) ( Figure 1C ) . However , Live/Dead staining evidenced cell lysis , including of cells at intermediate stages of sporulation ( classes a to c ) , from hour 36 of growth onwards ( data not shown ) . As assessed by Live/Dead staining and fluorescence microscopy , lysis of sporulating cells was only marginal at hour 24 of growth ( data not shown ) . Therefore , in subsequent experiments , sporulating cells were scored 24 hours following inoculation . At hour 24 , the total number of sporulating cells ( i . e . , the sum of classes a to e in Figure 1C ) represents about 15% of the total cell population . The genes for the four cell type-specific RNA polymerase sigma factors known to control gene expression during spore differentiation in B . subtilis are conserved in sporeformers [24]\u2013[27] . Moreover , their operon structure and genomic context is also maintained ( Figure S4A ) . To investigate whether the function of the \u03c3F , \u03c3E , \u03c3G and \u03c3K factors is conserved , each of the corresponding genes was disrupted ( Figure S4 ) . For this purpose , type II introns were targeted to each of the sig genes , using the ClosTron system [44] . As shown in Figure S4A , re-targeting of the intron resulted in insertion after codon 153 of the sigF gene , codon 151 of sigE , codon 182 of sigG , and codon 34 of the 5\u2032-end of the split sigK gene , interrupted by the skinCd element . Correct insertion of the intron was verified , in all cases , by PCR , and Southern blot analysis showed the presence of a single intron insertion in the genome of the different mutants ( Figure S4B through E ) . The sig mutants , along with the parental 630\u0394erm strain , were induced to sporulate in SM , and the titer of heat resistant spores assessed after 24 , 48 , and 72 hours of growth . For the wild type strain 630\u0394erm , the titer of spores was of 3\u00d7105 spores/ml at hour 24 , 2\u00d7106 spores/ml at hour 48 , and of 1\u00d7107 spores/ml at hour 72 ( Table 1 ) . In contrast , no heat resistant spores were found , at any time point tested , for the sigF ( AHCD533 ) , sigE ( AHCD532 ) , or sigG ( AHCD534 ) mutants . However , a titer of 103 heat resistant spores/ml of culture was found for the sigK mutant AHCD535 at hour 72 ( Table 1 ) . For complementation studies , we generated multicopy alleles of the sig genes , based on replicative plasmid pMTL84121 [45] , expressed from their native promoters ( the extent of the promoter fragments is shown in Figure S4A ) . Note that for complementation of the sigK mutation the two halves of the gene , together with a short skinCd element composed only of the putative recombinase gene ( spoIVCA , or CD12310 ) was used ( see below for a more detailed description on the complementation of the sigK mutation ) . When measured at hour 72 of growth in SM , the heat resistant spore titer was of 1 . 7\u00d7106 spores/ml for the wild type strain 630\u0394erm carrying the empty vector pMTL84121 . Derivatives of pMTL84121 carrying the sigF , sigE , sigG or sigK genes ( the later plasmid , pFT38 , with the short skinCd allele ) restored spore formation to the sig mutants , as assessed by microscopy ( Figure 2B ) . The same plasmids largely restored heat resistant spore formation to the sig mutants ( 1 . 6\u00d7104 , 8 . 3\u00d7105 , 3 . 9\u00d7105 , 4 . 8\u00d7105 spores/ml for the sigF , sigE , sigG , and sigK mutants , respectively , also measured at hour 72 of growth in SM ) . To establish the morphological phenotype of the various mutants we used phase contrast and fluorescence microscopy of samples collected from SM cultures at hour 24 , labeled with DAPI and FM4-64 ( Figure 2 ) . These studies revealed that the sigF and sigE mutants were blocked at the asymmetric division stage ( Figure 2A and C ) . As previously found for B . subtilis [37] , [46] , [47] both mutants formed abortive disporic forms , and occasionally multiple closely located polar septa ( Figure 2A ) . In addition , for the sigF mutant , small round cells were found , probably resulting from detachment of the forespore ( Figure 2A ) . In both mutants , the DNA stained strongly in the forespore ( s ) and gave a diffuse signal throughout the mother cell ( Figure 2A ) . TEM analysis confirmed the block at the asymmetric division stage for the two mutants ( Figure 2D ) . Cells of the sigG mutant completed the engulfment sequence , but did not proceed further in morphogenesis ( Figure 2A and C ) . As for class c in the wild type ( Figure 1B , and text above ) , the forespores in the sigG mutant stained strongly with FM4-64 ( Figure 2A ) . TEM of sporulating cells of the sigG mutant confirmed engulfment completion , but also revealed deposition of electrodense material around the forespore protoplast ( Figure 2D ) . This deposit could represent coat material . By comparison , no accumulation of electrodense coat-like material is seen by TEM around the engulfed forespore of a B . subtilis sigG mutant [48] . In this organism , coat assembly as discernible by TEM , is a late event that requires activation of \u03c3K in the mother cell [15] , [16] , [37] . Importantly , activation of \u03c3K is triggered by \u03c3G , and coincides with engulfment completion [49] , [50] . Therefore , the possible accumulation of coat material in the sigG mutant could imply that in C . difficile , \u03c3K is active independently of \u03c3G . We therefore wanted to test whether coat material was deposited around the forespore in the C . difficile sigG mutant . In B . subtilis , studies of protein localization have relied mainly on the use of translational fusions to the gfp gene , or its variants ( e . g . , [51] ) . However , an obstacle to the use of gfp or its derivatives in the anaerobe C . difficile , is that formation of the GFP fluorophore involves an oxidation reaction [52] . For this reason , we turned to the SNAP-tag reporter , which reacts with fluorescent derivatives of benzyl purine or pyrimidine substrates , and has been used in anaerobic bacteria [53] , [54] . We designed a variant of the SNAP26b gene , termed SNAPCd , codon-usage optimized for expression in C . difficile ( see Materials and Methods; see also Text S1 ) , and used it to construct C-terminal fusions of the SNAP-tag to spore coat proteins CotE and CotB [55] , [56] in plasmid pFT58 ( Figure S5B and C ) . The fusions were introduced , in a replicative plasmid , in strain 630\u0394erm and the sigG and sigK mutants , and samples from SM cultures at hour 24 were labeled with the cell-permeable fluorescent substrate TMR-Star ( see Materials and Methods ) . Using fluorescence microscopy and fluorimaging of SDS-PAGE-resolved whole cell extracts , no accumulation of CotE-SNAP was detected in cells of a sigK mutant , suggesting that the cotE gene is under the control of \u03c3K ( Figure 2E; see also below ) . CotB-SNAP , however , accumulated in cells of a sigK mutant ( Figure 2E ) , but not in cells of a sigE mutant ( data not shown ) , suggesting that expression of cotB is under the control of \u03c3E . Both CotE-SNAP and CotB-SNAP localized around the forespore in both wild type and in sigG cells ( Figure 2E ) . SDS-PAGE and fluorimaging suggested instability of CotB-SNAP for which several possible proteolytic fragments were detected , all of which larger that the SNAP domain ( Figure 2E ) . That no release of a labeled SNAP domain was detected for either protein implies that the localized fluorescence signal is largely due to the fusion proteins . Thus , both early ( CotB ) and late ( CotE ) coat proteins are assembled around the forespore in cells of a sigG mutant . In all , the results suggest that \u03c3K is active independently of \u03c3G , and thus , that the later regulatory protein is not a strict requirement for deposition of at least some coat in C . difficile . Phase contrast microscopy revealed the presence of some phase bright or partially phase bright spores in SM cultures of the sigK mutant , although free spores were only rarely seen ( Figure 2A ) . The ellipsoidal spores were often positioned slightly tilted relative to the longitudinal axis of the mother cell ( Figure 2 and 3 ) . The appearance of phase bright spores normally correlates with synthesis of the spore cortex PG , and the development of spore heat resistance [37] , [57] , in line with the finding that the sigK mutant formed heat resistant spores ( above ) . TEM revealed the presence of a cortex layer in cells of the sigK mutant , supporting the inferences drawn on the basis of the phase contrast microscopy and heat resistance assays ( Figure 2A to E ) . The number of phase bright or phase grey spores by phase contrast microscopy , was 3 . 2% of the total number of cells scored at hour 24 of growth in liquid SM ( Figure 2C ) . This is higher than the percentage of sporulation , 0 . 03% , measured by heat resistance ( Table 1 ) . Because full heat resistance requires synthesis of most of the cortex structure , this observation suggests that a large number of the spores formed have an incomplete or dysfunctional cortex . However , we cannot discard the possibility that spores of the mutant are deficient in germination . In any event , unlike in B . subtilis , where a sigK mutant is unable to form the spore cortex [37] , [57] , \u03c3K is not obligatory for the biogenesis of this structure in C . difficile . In contrast , the TEM analysis did not reveal deposition of coat material around the cortex in cells of the sigK mutant ( Figure 2D ) . Although coat assembly most likely starts early , under the control of \u03c3E ( [15] , [16] , [42]; above ) the TEM data , together with the data on assembly of CotE ( Figure 2E ) , suggest that the late stages in the assembly of the coats are under \u03c3K control . That free spores were only rarely seen for the sigK mutant , prompted us to test whether \u03c3K could have a role in mother cell lysis , using a Live/Dead stain and fluorescence microscopy . In the wild type strain 630\u0394erm , development of refractility coincided with loss of viability of the mother cell ( strong staining with propidium iodide ) and strong staining of the developing spore with the Syto 9 dye ( Figure 3A ) , [58] . In contrast , the mother cell remained viable in the sigK mutant ( strong staining with Syto 9 ) ( Figure 3A and B ) , and the spores stained only weakly with the Syto 9 dye . Lastly , our complementation analysis of the sigK mutant provided additional functional insight . While wild type levels of sporulation could be restored to a sigK mutant by a copy of the sigK gene bearing a deletion of all the genes within the skinCd element but the recombinase gene ( Figure 3C; see above ) , an uninterrupted copy of the gene , in plasmid pFT42 , did not restore sporulation ( Figure 3C and D ) . An earlier study has suggested that the absence of skinCd correlates with a sporulation defect and that a skinCd- allele of sigK is dominant over the wild type [39] . Our results support the view that generation of an intact sigK gene through SpoIVCA-mediated excision of the skinCd element is essential for sporulation . Moreover , we found that introduction of the multicopy skin-less allele in strain 630\u0394erm blocked sporulation at an early stage , as no asymmetrically positioned septa could be seen in the transformed strain ( Figure 3E ) . The results suggest that the absence of skinCd allows the production of active \u03c3K in pre-divisional cells , and that active \u03c3K interferes with the events leading to asymmetric septation in C . difficile . Having established the main features of sporulation under our culturing conditions , as well as the phenotypes associated with disruption of the sig genes , we next wanted to examine cell type-specific gene expression in relation to the course of morphogenesis . As a first step , we examined the expression of the genes coding for \u03c3F , \u03c3E , \u03c3G , and \u03c3K using the SNAPCd cassette as a transcriptional reporter . In control experiments , detailed in Text S1 , in which expression of SNAPCd was placed under the control of the anhydrotetracycline-inducible promoter Ptet ( Figure S5A ) [59] , we showed that complete labeling of all the SNAP produced could be achieved; furthermore , no background was detected for non-induced but labeled cells , or for unlabeled cells producing the SNAP reporter , by either fluorescence microscopy or the combination of fluorimaging and immunobloting with an anti-SNAP antibody , of SDS-PAGE resolved whole cell extracts ( Figure S6 ) . The promoter regions of sigF , sigE , sigG , and sigK genes were cloned in the SNAPCd-containing promoter probe vector pFT47 ( Figure S5B ) . The upstream boundaries of the promoter fragments fused to SNAPCd coincide with the 5\u2032-end of the fragments used for the successful complementation of the various sig mutants ( Figure 3C and S4A; see above ) . To monitor the production of SNAP during C . difficile sporulation , samples of cultures expressing each of the promoter fusions were collected at 24 h of growth in SM medium , and the cells doubly labeled with TMR-Star and the membrane dye MTG , to allow identification of the different stages of sporulation . These were defined based on Figure 1B , with the addition of a class of pre-divisional cells ( no signs of asymmetric division ) . Expression of the various Psig-SNAPCd transcriptional fusions could thus be correlated to the stage in spore morphogenesis . Expression of both sigF and sigE was first detected in pre-divisional cells of the wild type strain 630\u0394erm , but not in cells of a spo0A mutant ( Figure 4 ) , consistent with previous reports [60]\u2013[62] ( Figure S7A and B ) . Both genes continued to be expressed following asymmetric division , in the forespore and the mother cell of both the wild type , and the sigF or sigE mutants ( Figure 4 ) . In these experiments , complete labeling of the SNAP protein was achieved , as revealed by fluorimaging and immunobloting of SDS-PAGE resolved proteins in whole cell extracts ( Figure 5A ) . Quantification of the fluorescence signal shows that while for sigF the average intensity did not differ much between forespores ( 1 . 8\u00b10 . 5 ) , and mother cells ( 1 . 8\u00b10 . 5 ) , it increased in both the forespore and the mother cell relative to pre-divisional cells ( average signal , 1 . 5\u00b10 . 4 ) ( p<0 . 01 ) . Transcription of sigE , in turn , was lower in the forespore ( average signal , 0 . 8\u00b10 . 3 ) as compared to pre-divisional cells ( 1 . 0\u00b10 . 3 ) or the mother cell ( 1 . 0\u00b10 . 3 ) ( p<0 . 0001 ) ( Figure 5B ) . Thus , transcription of sigE , seems to occur preferentially in the mother cell . Transcription of both sigF and sigE persisted in both the forespore and the mother cell until a late stage of sporulation , when the forespore becomes phase bright ( Figure 4 ) . In contrast to sigF and sigE , transcription of sigG and sigK was confined to the forespore and to the mother cell , respectively ( Figure 4 ) . Transcription of sigG is detected in the forespore just after asymmetric division , consistent with the presence of a \u03c3F-type promoter in its regulatory region ( Figure S7C ) . In agreement with this inference , expression of PsigG-SNAPCd was not detected in cells of a sigF mutant ( Figure 4 ) . Transcription of sigG was detected until the development of spore refractility ( Figure 4 ) . Fluorimaging and immunoblot analysis of whole cell extracts shows that under the conditions used , all of the SNAP protein detected was labeled ( Figure 5A ) . In B . subtilis , \u03c3F initiates transcription of sigG in the forespore [48] , [63] . However , transcription of sigG also depends on \u03c3E , by an unknown mechanism [64] . In contrast , forespore-specific expression of PsigG-SNAPCd was detected in most cells ( 82% ) of a sigE mutant ( Figure 4 ) . In B . subtilis , the main period of sigG transcription takes place following engulfment completion , and relies on a positive auto-regulatory loop [65] . We detected transcription of sigG both prior and following engulfment completion in a sigG mutant ( Figure 4 ) . However , the quantitative analysis of the SNAP-TMR signal shows an increase in the average fluorescence intensity following engulfment completion ( classes c+d , 2 . 6\u00b11 . 0 as opposed to 2 . 2\u00b10 . 9 for classes a+b ) ( p<0 . 01 ) ( Figure 5B ) . Moreover , the average fluorescence signal for engulfed forespores of a sigG mutant suffered a higher reduction compared to the wild type ( classes c+d , 1 . 9\u00b10 . 7 for the mutant as compared to 2 . 6\u00b11 . 0 for the wild type; p<0 . 01 ) , than did the signal for pre-engulfment forespores of the mutant ( classes a+b , 1 . 7\u00b10 . 5 as opposed to 2 . 2\u00b10 . 9; p<0 . 05 ) ( Figure 5B ) . While evidencing that \u03c3G contributes to transcription of its own gene both prior to and following engulfment completion , these results suggest that the auto-regulatory effect is stronger at the later stage . In C . difficile , transcription of sigK was confined to the mother cell and detected soon after asymmetric division ( Figure 4 ) . Moreover , disruption of sigE resulted in undetected expression of PsigK-SNAPCd ( Figure 4 ) . Together , the results suggest that the initial transcription of sigK is activated by \u03c3E in the mother cell , consistent with the presence of a possible \u03c3E-recognized promoter in the sigK regulatory region ( Figure S7D ) . Interestingly , transcription of the sigK gene was also detected in a small percentage ( 9% ) of the sporulating cells of a sigF mutant ( Figure 4 ) . This was unexpected because in B . subtilis , activation of \u03c3E in the mother cell is dependent on \u03c3F [66] , [67] . This observation thus raises the possibility that the activation of \u03c3E in C . difficile is at least partially independent of \u03c3F ( see also the following section ) . Transcription of sigK was also detected following engulfment completion , in cells carrying phase grey and phase bright spores ( Figure 4 ) . As shown in Figure 5A , all of the SNAP produced from the PsigK-SNAPCd fusion was , under our experimental conditions , labeled . The average intensity of the fluorescence signal from PsigK-SNAPCd in cells prior ( classes a+b , 0 . 6\u00b10 . 1 ) and after engulfment completion ( class c , 0 . 7\u00b10 . 2 ) was very close . However , expression was significantly increased for those cells that carried phase bright spores ( class d , 1 . 4\u00b10 . 8; p<0 . 001 ) ( Figure 5B ) . This suggests that the onset of the main period of sigK transcription coincides with the final stages in spore morphogenesis . Lastly , under our experimental conditions , we found no evidence for auto-regulation of sigK transcription , as expression of PsigK-SNAPCd was not curtailed by mutation of sigK at any morphological stage analyzed ( Figure 4 and data not shown ) . To investigate the genetic dependencies for sigma factor activity during sporulation in C . difficile , we used transcriptional SNAPCd fusions to promoters under the control of each cell type-specific sigma factor . These promoters were selected on the basis of qRT-PCR experiments and the presence on their regulatory regions , of sequences conforming well to the consensus for promoter recognition by the sporulation sigma factors of B . subtilis [68] ( Figure S8 ) . The gpr gene of B . subtilis codes for a spore-specific protease required for degradation of the DNA-protecting small acid-soluble spore proteins ( SASP ) during spore germination ( [1]; see also below ) . Even though this gene is under the dual control of \u03c3F and \u03c3G in B . subtilis , the C . difficille orthologue of gpr ( CD2470 ) was chosen as a reporter for \u03c3F activity ( Figure S8A ) . First , qRT-PCR showed that transcription of the C . difficille orthologue ( CD2470 ) was severely reduced in a sigF mutant ( Figure 6A ) . Secondly , expression of a Pgpr-SNAPCd fusion , monitored by fluorescence microscopy , was confined to the forespore and detected soon after asymmetric division in 66% of the cells that were at this stage of sporulation ( Figure 6B ) . Lastly , expression was eliminated by disruption of the sigF gene but detected in 99% of the cells of the sigG mutant ( compared for the wild type at the same stage , i . e . , 95% ) ( Figure 6B ) . This suggests that \u03c3G does not contribute significantly to gpr expression . Forespore-specific expression of Pgpr-SNAPCd was also detected following engulfment completion ( Figure 6B ) . Therefore , in spite of expression of the sigF gene in both the forespore and the mother cell , \u03c3F is active exclusively in the forespore . In these experiments , all of the SNAP protein produced from Pgpr-SNAPCd was labeled with the TMR-Star substrate ( Figure 7A ) . A quantitative analysis of the fluorescence signal from Pgpr-SNAPCd showed no significant difference between cells before ( average signal for classes a+b , 2 . 0\u00b10 . 5 ) or after engulfment completion ( classes c+d , 1 . 9\u00b10 . 7 ) ( Figure 7B ) . This suggests that \u03c3F is active in the forespore throughout development . To monitor the activity of \u03c3E , we examined expression of the first gene , spoIIIAA , of the spoIIIA operon . This operon is under the control of \u03c3E in B . subtilis [69]\u2013[71] and sequences that conform well to the consensus for promoter recognition by B . subtilis \u03c3E are found just upstream of the C . difficile spoIIIAA gene ( or CD1192 ) ( Figure S8B ) . The qRT-PCR experiments showed that expression of spoIIIAA was much more severely affected by a mutation in sigE than by disruption of sigF ( Figure 6A ) . While consistent with a direct control of spoIIIAA by \u03c3E , this observation adds to the evidence suggesting that unlike in B . subtilis [21] , [66] , [67] , the activity of \u03c3E is at least partially independent on the prior activation of \u03c3F ( as also hinted by the observation that transcription of the sigK gene , abolished by mutation of sigE , was still detected in a fraction of cells of a sigF mutant; above ) . If so , then expression of a PspoIIIAA-SNAPCd fusion should be confined to the mother cell , dependent on sigE , but partially independent on sigF . PspoIIIAA-SNAPCd-driven SNAP production was indeed confined to the mother cell , detected just after asymmetric division in 89% of the cells scored at this stage of sporulation , eliminated by mutation of sigE , but still detected ( in the mother cell ) in 21% of sigF cells ( Figure 6B ) . Labeling of the SNAP protein produced from the PspoIIIAA-SNAPCd fusion was quantitative ( Figure 7A ) , and the quantitative analysis of the average fluorescence signal shows no significant difference in expression levels before or after engulfment completion ( Figure 7B ) . PspoIIIAA-SNAPCd expression persisted until late stages in development , and was still detected for cells in which phase bright spores were seen ( Figure 7B ) . The sspA gene of B . subtilis codes for a small acid-soluble spore protein ( SASP ) that , together with other SASP family members , binds to and protects the spore DNA [1] . Expression of sspA in B . subtilis is controlled by \u03c3G [68] , [69] , and a \u03c3G-type promoter can be recognized upstream of the C . difficile orthologue ( CD2688 ) ( Figure S8C ) . Unexpectedly , a mutation in sigF caused a greater decrease in sspA transcription than disruption of sigE or sigG , in our qRT-PCR analysis ( Figure 6A ) . While not excluding a contribution of \u03c3F to the expression of sspA , this result may be affected by the lack of synchronization of sporulation in the liquid SM cultures . Consistent with \u03c3G control of sspA in C difficile , PsspA-driven SNAP production was confined to the forespore and eliminated by disruption of sigF or of sigG ( but not of sigE or sigK ) ( Figure 6B ) . This is in agreement with the requirement for \u03c3F for the transcription of sigG ( above ) , and seems to exclude a contribution of \u03c3F for sspA transcription as suggested by the qRT-PCR analysis . sspA expression was detected in 50% of the cells that had just completed asymmetric division , but also throughout the engulfment sequence ( 72% of the cells ) , following engulfment completion ( 85% of the cells scored ) , and in cells ( 75% ) carrying phase bright spores ( Figure 6B ) . Our analysis of sigG transcription suggested that it increased following engulfment completion , with a stronger auto-regulatory component than in pre-engulfed cells ( above ) . In B . subtilis , continued transcription in the forespore when ( upon engulfment completion ) it becomes isolated from the surrounding medium , requires the activity of \u03c3E [72]\u2013[76] . To determine whether the activity of \u03c3G increased following engulfment completion in a manner that required \u03c3E , we quantified the SNAP-TMR signal in cells expressing PsspA-SNAPCd . Control experiments showed that all the SNAP protein produced from the PsspA-SNAPCd fusion was labeled with the TMR-Star substrate ( Figure 7A ) . The average intensity of the SNAP-TMR signal increased from 1 . 6\u00b10 . 5 before engulfment completion ( classes a+b ) to 2 . 1\u00b104 , following engulfment completion ( classes c+d ) ( p<0 . 0001 ) ( Figure 7B ) . This result is consistent with the analysis of sigG transcription ( above ) and indicates that the activity of \u03c3G increases following engulfment completion . Importantly , even though sspA expression was found for 61% of the sigE mutant cells , disruption of sigE reduced the average fluorescence signal in the forespore ( 1 . 6\u00b10 . 7 ) to the level seen before engulfment completion for the wild type ( 1 . 6\u00b10 . 5 ) . We conclude that disruption of sigE does not prevent activity of \u03c3G prior to engulfment completion . Finally , to monitor the activity of \u03c3K , we examined expression of the cotE gene , coding for an abundant spore coat protein in C . difficile [55] . This gene has no counterpart in B . subtilis , but as shown above , production of a CotE-SNAP translational fusion was dependent on \u03c3K ( Figure 2E ) and a sequence that conforms well to the consensus for \u03c3K promoters of B . subtilis can be recognized in its promoter region ( Figure S8D ) . qRT-PCR experiments show that disruption of the sigE and sigK genes caused a much stronger reduction in the expression of cotE than mutations in sigF or sigG ( Figure 6A ) . While not excluding a contribution from \u03c3E , the qRT-PCR data are in line with the interpretation that the main regulator of cotE expression is \u03c3K ( with \u03c3E driving production of \u03c3K ) . We note that the reduced effect of the sigF mutation on cotE expression is in agreement with the view that \u03c3E production is partially independent on \u03c3F , as discussed above . We also note that the reduced effect of the sigG mutation on cotE expression is in agreement with the morphological analysis and the data on the assembly of the CotE-SNAP fusion ( Figure 2D and E ) , suggesting \u03c3K-dependent deposition of coat material independently of \u03c3G . Fluorescence microscopy reveals that expression of PcotE-SNAPCd is confined to the mother cell ( Figure 6B ) . However , expression of PcotE-SNAPCd was found just after asymmetric division in only 2% of the cells , and during engulfment in only 10% of the cells ( Figure 6B ) . Expression increased to 66% of the cells after engulfment completion , and to 88% of the cells that showed phase bright spores ( Figure 6B ) . Expression of PcotE-SNAPCd was eliminated by disruption of sigE , but retained in 3% of the sporulating cells of a sigF mutant ( Figure 6B ) . This is consistent with data presented above , also in line with the inference that the activity of \u03c3K is partially independent on sigF ( Figure 6A and B ) . Moreover , 66% of the cells of a sigG mutant that had completed the engulfment process ( as illustrated in Figure 6B ) showed expression of the reporter fusion , again suggesting \u03c3K activity independently of \u03c3G . Interestingly , disruption of sigK did not abolish expression of the fusion , which was detected in 90% of the sporulating cells , but at low levels ( Figure 6B ) . This raises the possibility that \u03c3E is responsible for the few cells that produce the reporter prior to engulfment completion . To test these possibilities quantitatively , we first verified that all the SNAP-tag produced from the PcotE-SNAPCd fusion was labeled , under our experimental conditions ( Figure 7A ) . The average intensity of the SNAP-TMR signal was of 0 . 6\u00b10 . 1 for cells of the wild type strain prior to engulfment completion ( classes a+b ) , of 1 . 2\u00b10 . 8 for those that had just completed engulfment ( class c ) , and of 3 . 3\u00b11 . 1 for cells with phase bright spores ( class d ) ( Figure 7B ) . Inactivation of sigG did not affect the expression level of the fusion prior to engulfment completion ( classes a+b for the sigG mutant , average signal , 0 . 6\u00b10 . 1 ) , nor did it prevent expression following engulfment completion ( class c of the sigG mutant , 1 . 3\u00b10 . 8 ) ( Figure 7B ) . However , the average fluorescence signal for all classes of the sigG mutant ( 1 . 3\u00b10 . 8 ) is significantly lower than the average for all classes of the wild type ( 1 . 9\u00b11 . 3 ) ( p<0 . 001 ) ( Figure 7B ) . Finally , the average fluorescence signal for all cells of the sigK mutant was lower ( 0 . 3\u00b10 . 1 ) than for pre-engulfment cells of the wild type ( classes a+b , 0 . 6\u00b10 . 1 ) ( p<0 . 0001 ) , suggesting that both \u03c3E and \u03c3K contribute to expression of the reporter fusion in these cells . Together , these data suggest that the main period of \u03c3K activity is delayed relative to engulfment completion , and coincides with development of spore refractility . \n The cytological and TEM analysis shows that the sigF and sigE mutants are arrested just after asymmetric division . It follows that \u03c3F and \u03c3E control early stages of development in C . difficile , consistent with the function of these sigma factors in B . subtilis . Disruption of sigE also arrested development just after asymmetric division in C . perfringens [29] . In contrast , disruption of either the sigF or sigE genes in C . acetobutylicum blocks sporulation prior to asymmetric division [31] , [33] . In C . difficile , expression of both sigF and sigE commenced in predivisional cells , in line with work showing that expression of the sigF-containing operon ( also coding for two other proteins , SpoIIAA and SpoIIAB , that control \u03c3F ) occurs from a \u03c3H and Spo0A-controlled promoter , and with the observation that transcription of sigE is activated from a \u03c3A-type promoter to which Spo0A also binds [60] , [61] . In B . subtilis , following asymmetric septation , Spo0A becomes a cell-specific transcription factor , active predominantly in the mother cell [77] . This may also be the case in C . difficile , because transcription of sigE increased in the mother cell , relative to the forespore , following asymmetric division ( Figure 7B ) . In B . subtilis , \u03c3F is held in an inactive complex by the anti-sigma factor SpoIIAB [21] , [23] . The reaction that releases \u03c3F takes place specifically in the forespore , soon after septation , and involves the anti-anti sigma factor SpoIIAA and the SpoIIE phosphatase . SpoIIAB , SpoIIAA and SpoIIE are produced in the C . difficile predivisional cell under Spo0A control [24]\u2013[27] , [60] , [61] . Because the activity of \u03c3F was confined to the forespore , we presume that the pathway leading to the forespore-specific activation of this sigma factor is also conserved . In C . acetobutylicum , this pathway may lead to \u03c3F activation in pre-divisional cells , as disruption of sigF or spoIIE blocks sporulation prior to asymmetric division [33] , [35] . In B . subtilis , \u03c3E is also synthesized in the predivisional but as an inactive pro-protein [21] , [23] . Processing of pro-\u03c3E in the mother cell requires activation of the SpoIIGA protease by SpoIIR , a \u03c3F-controlled signaling protein secreted from the forespore [66] , [67] . Hence , the activity of \u03c3E requires the prior activation of \u03c3F . In C . difficile , the activity of \u03c3E was also restricted to the mother cell ( Figure 7B ) . Because \u03c3E of C . difficile bears , like its B . subtilis counterpart , a pro sequence , and because the SpoIIGA protease and SpoIIR are conserved [24]\u2013[27] , the \u03c3E activation pathway also seems conserved . Strikingly however , both the qRT-PCR and the SNAP labeling experiments showed that the activity of \u03c3E is at least partially independent on \u03c3F ( Figure 6 ) . We do not know whether production of SpoIIR is also partially independent on \u03c3F . However , in C . acetobutylicum , in which \u03c3F is activated ( and required ) prior to asymmetric septation [33] , [35] , production of SpoIIR is , at least in part , independent of \u03c3F [33] . The cytological and TEM analysis showed that a sigG mutant completes the engulfment sequence , suggesting that \u03c3G is mainly required for late stages in development , consistent with its role in B . subtilis . Disruption of sigG also causes a late morphological block in C . acetobutylicum [78] . In B . subtilis , the forespore-specific transcription of sigG is initiated by \u03c3F but is delayed , relative to other \u03c3F-dependent genes , towards the engulfment sequence [21] , [64] , [68] , [69] . Moreover , the activity of \u03c3E , in the mother cell , is required for transcription of sigG [21] , [64] . In contrast , transcription of sigG in C . difficile , was detected soon after asymmetric septation , and was not dependent on \u03c3E ( Figure 4 and 5 ) . Transcription of sigG also appears to be independent of sigE in C . perfringens [29] . The main period of sigG transcription in B . subtilis relies on an auto-regulatory loop activated coincidently with engulfment completion [65] . Therefore , the main period of \u03c3G activity coincides with engulfment completion . At least the anti-sigma factor CsfB ( \u03c3F-controlled ) appears important for impeding the \u03c3G auto-regulatory loop from functioning prior to engulfment completion , the main period of activity of the preceding forespore sigma factor , \u03c3F [21] , [23] , [72] , [79] , [80] . CsfB is absent from C . difficile as well as from other Clostridia [24] , [25] , [27] . In C . difficile , not only is transcription of sigG observed soon after asymmetric division , but the activity of \u03c3G , is also detected prior to engulfment completion . Nevertheless , our analysis indicates that \u03c3G activity increases following engulfment completion . In addition , our results suggest that \u03c3G is auto-regulatory both before , and more markedly , following engulfment completion . A universal feature of endosporulation is the isolation of the forespore , surrounded by two membranes , from the external medium at the end of the engulfment sequence . In B . subtilis , the 8 mother cell proteins encoded by the spoIIIA operon , which localize to the forespore outer membrane , and the forespore-specific SpoIIQ protein , which localizes to the forespore inner membrane , are involved in the assembly of a specialized secretion system that links the cytoplasm of the two cells [72]\u2013[76] . Recent work has shown that the SpoIIIA-SpoIIQ secretion system functions as a feeding tube required for continued macromolecular synthesis in the engulfed forespore [76] . Mutation of sigE reduced the activity of \u03c3G but because the mutant is blocked at an early stage , we do not presently know whether \u03c3E is required for \u03c3G activity in the engulfed forespore . The SpoIIIAH and SpoIIQ proteins also facilitate forespore engulfment in B . subtilis [81] . The spoIIIA operon is conserved in sporeformers [24] , [25] , [27] , and spoIIIA is under \u03c3E control in C . difficile ( this work ) . A gene , CD0125 , coding for a LytM-containing protein ( as the B . subtilis SpoIIQ protein ) may represent a non-orthologous gene replacement of spoIIQ [24] . We do not yet know whether spoIIIA and CD0125 are essential for sporulation in C . difficile and if so , whether they are required for engulfment and/or continued gene expression in the engulfed forespore . The TEM analysis shows that the sigK mutant of C . difficile lacks a visible coat ( Figure 2D ) . However , as in B . subtilis [15] , [16] assembly of the coat begins with \u03c3E , as suggested by the forespore localization of CotB-SNAP in cells of the sigK mutant , and supported by recent work on the analysis of coat morphogenetic proteins SpoIVA and SipL [42] . Most likely , \u03c3K controls the final stages in the assembly of the spore surface structures , including the coat and exosporium . However , \u03c3K is not a strict requirement for the formation of heat resistant spores ( Figure 2 and Table 1 ) , and we presume that \u03c3E and \u03c3G ( see above ) are largely responsible for synthesis of the spore cortex . Final assembly of the coat together with the role of C . difficile \u03c3K in mother cell autolysis , are functions shared with its B . subtilis counterpart . Transcription and activity of the C . difficile sigK gene was dependent on sigE , and was detected at low levels prior to engulfment completion . However , both transcription and activity increased , following engulfment completion , coincidently with the appearance of phase grey and phase bright spores . Transcription of the sigK and spoIVCA genes of B . subtilis , the latter coding for the recombinase that excises the skin element , is initiated under the control of \u03c3E with the assistance of the regulatory protein SpoIIID , and is delayed relative to a first wave of \u03c3E-directed genes [21] , [23] , [69] , [70] . SpoIIID is conserved in C . difficile [27] and it may only accumulate to levels sufficient to enhance sigK and spoIVCA transcription at late stages in morphogenesis . Two observations highlight the importance of the skin element in C . difficile . First , with the exception of an asporogenous strain of C . tetani , the skin element is not present in other Clostridial species [17] , [39] . Second , not only a skin-less allele of sigK fails to complement a sigK mutation but also acts as a dominant negative mutation [39] , blocking entry into sporulation ( Figure 3D and E ) ( while these results seem to imply that \u03c3K is auto-regulatory , we did not detect auto-regulation of sigK in our single cell analysis ) . Absence of the skin element may allow the recruitment of \u03c3K for other functions . In C . perfringens and in C . botulinum , \u03c3K is produced in pre-divisional cells , and is involved in enterotoxin production in the first , and in cold and osmotic stress tolerance in the second [29] , [82] . A key finding of the present study is that contrary to B . subtilis , sigG is not essential for the activity of \u03c3K . In B . subtilis a signaling protein , SpoIVB , secreted from the forespore activates the pro-\u03c3K processing protease SpoIVFB , which is kept inactive in a complex with BofA and SpoIVFA , embedded in the forespore outer membrane [21] , [22] . SpoIVFB , BofA and possibly also SpoIVFA are absent from C . difficile , suggesting that the \u03c3G to \u03c3K pathway is absent and consistent with the lack of a pro-sequence [24] , [27] , [36] . However , C . difficile codes for two orthologues of SpoIVB [24] , [25] , [27] . Mutations that bypass the need for sigG or spoIVB in B . subtilis result in coat deposition , but not cortex formation , phenocopying the sigG mutant of C . difficile [50] . In B . subtilis , SpoIVB is also required for the engulfment-regulated proteolysis of SpoIIQ [83] . The C . difficile SpoIVB orthologues may be involved in cortex formation and/or proteolysis of CD0125 ( above ) . While the activity of \u03c3K did not require \u03c3G , our data shows that mutation of sigG reduced the activity of \u03c3K at late stages of spore morphogenesis . Because the sigG mutant fails to form phase grey/bright spores , we do not presently know if a forespore-mother cell signaling operates at this stage , or whether the late stages in spore morphogenesis serve as a cue for enhanced activity of \u03c3K . We show that the main periods of activity of the four cell type-specific sigma factors of C . difficile are conserved , relative to the B . subtilis model , with \u03c3F and \u03c3E controlling early stages of development and \u03c3G and \u03c3K governing late developmental events ( Figure 8A and B ) . However , the fact that the activity of \u03c3E was partially independent of \u03c3F , and that \u03c3G or \u03c3K did not require \u03c3E or \u03c3G , respectively , seems to imply a weaker connection between the forespore and mother cell lines of gene expression . In spite of the important differences in the roles of the sporulation sigma factors and the regulatory circuits leading to their activation ( Figure 8A and B ) , overall , in what concerns the genetic control of sporulation , C . difficile seems closer to the model organism B . subtilis than the other Clostridial species that have been studied . Differences in the function/period of activity of the sporulation sigma factors in other Clostridial species , may be related to the coordination of solventogenesis , toxin production or other functions with sporulation [28]\u2013[35] . We note however that the relationship between toxinogenesis and spore formation in C . difficile is still unclear [13] , [60] . Together with the accompanying work of Saujet and co-authors [62] , our study provides the first comprehensive description of spore morphogenesis in relation to cell type-specific gene expression in a Clostridial species that is also an important human pathogen . The two studies establish a platform for analyzing the control of toxin production in relation to C . difficile sporulation , and for the functional characterization of genes predicted to be important for spore functions related to host colonization , spore germination , recurrent sporulation in the host , and spore dissemination . \n Bacterial strains and their relevant properties are listed in Table S2 . The Escherichia coli strain DH5\u03b1 ( Bethesda Research laboratories ) was used for molecular cloning . Luria-Bertani medium was routinely used for growth and maintenance of E . coli and B . subtilis . The B . subtilis strains are congenic derivatives of the Spo+ strain MB24 ( trpC2 metC3 ) . Sporulation of B . subtilis was induced by growth and exhaustion in Difco sporulation medium ( DSM ) [84] . When indicated , ampicillin ( 100 \u00b5g/ml ) or chloramphenicol ( 15 \u00b5g/ml ) was added to the culture medium . The C . difficile strains used in this study are congenic derivatives of the wild type strain 630\u0394erm [85] and were routinely grown anaerobically ( 5% H2 , 15% CO2 , 80% N2 ) at 37\u00b0C in brain heart infusion ( BHI ) medium ( Difco ) , BHIS [BHI medium supplemented with yeast extract ( 5 mg/ml ) and L-cysteine ( 0 . 1% ) , or SM medium ( for 1l: 90 g Bacto-tryptone , 5 g Bacto-peptone , 1 g ( NH4 ) 2SO4 and 1 . 5 g Tris base ) ] [41] . Sporulation assays were performed in SM medium [41] . When necessary , cefoxitin ( 25 \u00b5g/ml ) , thiamphenicol ( 15 \u00b5g/ml ) , or erythromycin ( 5 \u00b5g/ml ) was added to C . difficile cultures . Overnight cultures grown at 37\u00b0C in BHI were used to inoculate SM medium ( at a dilution of 1\u2236200 ) . At specific time points , 1 ml of culture was withdrawn , serially diluted in phosphate-buffered saline ( PBS; 137 mM NaCl , 10 mM Phosphate , 2 . 7 mM KCl , pH 7 . 4 ) , and plated before and after heat treatment ( 30 min at 60\u00b0C ) , to determine the total and heat-resistant colony forming units ( CFU ) . The samples were plated onto BHI plates supplemented with 0 . 1% taurocholate ( Sigma-Aldrich ) , to promote efficient spore germination [41] . The percentage of sporulation was determined as the ratio between the number of spores/ml and the total number of bacteria/ml times 100 . In a preliminary set of experiments , we defined the time for which the difference in expression of a selected \u03c3 target gene between the wild type and the corresponding mutant strain was highest . To study \u03c3E- or \u03c3F-dependent control , we harvested cells from 630\u0394erm , sigF and sigE mutants after 14 h of growth in SM medium . Strain 630\u0394erm and the sigG or the sigK mutants were harvested after 19 h ( 630\u0394erm , sigG mutant ) and 24 h ( 630\u0394erm , sigK mutant ) of growth in SM medium . Total RNA was extracted from at least two independent cultures . After centrifugation , the culture pellets were resuspended in RNApro solution ( MP Biomedicals ) and RNA extracted using the FastRNA Pro Blue Kit , according to the manufacturer's instructions . The RNA quality was determined using RNA 6000 Nano Reagents ( Agilent ) . For quantitative RT-PCR experiments , 1 \u00b5g of total RNA was heated at 70\u00b0C for 10 min along with 1 \u00b5g of hexamer oligonucleotide primers p ( dN ) 6 ( Roche ) . After slow cooling , cDNAs were synthesized as previously described [61] . The reverse transcriptase was inactivated by incubation at 85\u00b0C for 5 min . Real-time quantitative RT-PCR was performed twice in a 20 \u00b5l reaction volume containing 20 ng of cDNAs , 10 \u00b5l of FastStart SYBR Green Master mix ( ROX , Roche ) and 200 nM gene-specific primers in a AB7300 real-time PCR instrument ( Applied Biosystems ) . The primers used for each marker are listed in Table S3 . Amplification and detection were performed as previously described [61] . In each sample , the quantity of cDNAs of a gene was normalized to the quantity of cDNAs of the DNApolIII gene . The relative transcript changes were calculated using the 2\u2212\u0394\u0394Ct method as described [61] . The construction of transcriptional fusions of the promoters for the sigF , sigE , sigG and sigK genes , as well as the construction of translational fusions of cotB and cotE to the SNAP-tag [86] is described in detail in Text S1 . In these plasmids , listed in Table S4 , we used a synthetic SNAP cassette , codon usage optimized for C . difficile ( DNA 2 . 0 , Menlo Park , CA ) , which we termed SNAPCd ( the sequence is available for download at www . itqb . unl . pt/~aoh/SNAPCdDNAseq . docx ) . Whole cell extracts were obtained by withdrawing 10 ml samples from C . difficile cultures in brain heart infusion ( BHI ) for the Ptet-SNAP-bearing strains , or in SM medium for the sporulation experiments , at the desired times . The extracts were prepared immediately following labeling with 250 nM of the TMR-Star substrate ( New England Biolabs ) , for 30 min in the dark . Following labeling , the cells were collected by centrifugation ( 4000\u00d7g , for 5 min at 4\u00b0C ) , the cell sediment was washed with phosphate-buffered saline ( PBS ) and resuspended in 1 ml French press buffer ( 10 mM Tris pH 8 . 0 , 10 mM MgCl2 , 0 . 5 mM EDTA , 0 . 2 mM NaCl , 10% Glycerol , 1 mM PMSF ) . The cells were lysed using a French pressure cell ( 18000 lb/in2 ) . Proteins in the extracts were resolved on 15% SDS-PAGE gels . The gels were first scanned in a Fuji TLA-5100 fluorimager , and then subject to immunoblot analysis as described before [65] . The anti-SNAP antibody ( New England Biolabs ) was used at a 1\u22361000 dilution , and a rabbit secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase ( Sigma ) was used at dilution 1\u223610000 . The immunoblots were developed with enhanced chemiluminescence reagents ( Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ) . Samples of 1 ml were withdrawn from BHI or SM cultures at the desired times following inoculation , and the cells collected by centrifugation ( 4000\u00d7g for 5 min ) . The cells were washed with 1 ml of PBS , and ressuspended in 0 . 1 ml of PBS supplemented with the lipophilic styryl membrane dye N- ( 3-triethylammoniumprpyl ) -4- ( p-diethylaminophenyl-hexatrienyl ) pyridinium dibromide ( FM4-64; 10 \u00b5g . ml\u22121 ) [43] , [87] , and the DNA stain DAPI ( 4\u2032 , 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; 50 \u00b5g . ml\u22121 ) ( both from Molecular Probes , Invitrogen ) . For the live/dead assay , samples were collected as described above , ressuspended in 0 . 05 ml of PBS and mixed with an equal volume of 2\u00d7 LIVE/DEAD BacLight 2\u00d7 staining reagent mixture ( Molecular Probes , Invitrogen ) containing Propidium iodide ( 30 \u00b5M final concentration ) and syto9 ( 6 \u00b5M final concentration ) . For SNAP labeling experiments , cells in culture samples were labeled with TMR-Star ( as above ) , collected by centrifugation ( 4000\u00d7g , 3 min , at room temperature ) , washed four times with 1 ml of PBS , and finally ressuspended in 1 ml of PBS containing the membrane dye Mitotracker Green ( 0 . 5 \u00b5g . ml\u22121 ) ( Molecular Probes , Invitrogen ) . For phase contrast and fluorescence microscopy , cells were mounted on 1 . 7% agarose coated glass slides and observed on a Leica DM6000B microscope equipped with a phase contrast Uplan F1 100\u00d7 objective and a CCD Ixon camera ( Andor Technologies ) [65] . Images were acquired and analyzed using the Metamorph software suite version 5 . 8 ( Universal Imaging ) , and adjusted and cropped using ImageJ ( http://rsbweb . nih . gov/ij/ ) . Exposure times were adjusted and defined for each SNAP transcriptional or translational fusion analyzed . For quantification of the SNAPCd signal resulting from transcriptional fusions , 6\u00d76 pixel regions were defined in the desired cell and the average pixel intensity was calculated , and corrected by subtracting the average pixel intensity of the background . Small fluctuations of fluorescence among different fields were corrected by normalizing to the average pixel intensity obtained for the intrinsic autofluorescence of C . difficile cells [88] . Statistical analysis was carried out using GraphPad Prism ( Version 6 . 0; GraphPad Software Inc . ) . The non-parametric Kolmogorov-Smirnov test ( KS-test ) was applied to compare distributions obtained from quantifications of the SNAP-TMR signal . The P-value is indicated for all comparisons whose differences were found to be statistically significant . Although the results presented are from a single experiment , all experiments involving quantification of a fluorescence signal were performed independently three times and only results that were considered statistically significant by a KS-test in all three experiments were considered to be statistically relevant . For transmission electron microscopy electron ( TEM ) analysis , cells of the wild type 630\u0394erm strains and of the various sig mutants were collected at various times following inoculation onto Columbia Horse Blood Agar plates ( BioM\u00e9rieux ) . The high fraction of sporulating cells under these growth conditions , facilitates the TEM analysis [89] . Samples were processed for TEM as described previously [90] .", "headings": ["Abstract", "Introduction", "Results", "Discussion", "Materials and Methods"], "keywords": [], "id": "journal.pgen.1003782"}
{"lay_summary": "A large number of proteins in the cell are modified post-translationally by phosphorylation at multiple specific locations . This can help bring about interesting dynamical behaviors such as bistability or all-or-none responses to stimuli . Such behaviors are in turn important for cellular decision-making , differentiation , or the regulation of cellular processes . In this paper we propose the use of a specific technique for modeling allosteric multisite proteins , which can be thought of as the reduced version of a more detailed set of reactions . After validating this technique computationally by comparison to more detailed systems , we apply it to a new model of a signal transduction pathway with several multisite proteins . The model is concerned with a mechanism in budding yeast that is thought to measure the extent of daughter bud growth and send a signal to initiate mitosis when sufficient growth has occurred . Using the given framework we derive an analytically tractable model that creates the desired all-or-none signal . Overall , we give quantitative support to a newly discovered biochemical pathway , and we show the utility of the new modeling framework in the context of a realistic biological problem .", "article": "We explore a framework to model the dose response of allosteric multisite phosphorylation proteins using a single auxiliary variable . This reduction can closely replicate the steady state behavior of detailed multisite systems such as the Monod-Wyman-Changeux allosteric model or rule-based models . Optimal ultrasensitivity is obtained when the activation of an allosteric protein by its individual sites is concerted and redundant . The reduction makes this framework useful for modeling and analyzing biochemical systems in practical applications , where several multisite proteins may interact simultaneously . As an application we analyze a newly discovered checkpoint signaling pathway in budding yeast , which has been proposed to measure cell growth by monitoring signals generated at sites of plasma membrane growth . We show that the known components of this pathway can form a robust hysteretic switch . In particular , this system incorporates a signal proportional to bud growth or size , a mechanism to read the signal , and an all-or-none response triggered only when the signal reaches a threshold indicating that sufficient growth has occurred . \n Protein phosphorylation is a common form of post-translational modification frequently used in nature to alter protein activity , for instance by changing the electrostatic properties of the protein or its spatial structure . The phosphorylation of the same protein at multiple different aminoacid residues is also very common , and it is found in proteins such as p53 [1] , Sic1 [2] , EGFR [3] , Wee1 [4] , Ste5 [5] and many others [6] . The differences in the function of single-site vs . multisite phosphorylation are not completely understood . Many multisite proteins are involved in regulatory processes that can benefit from the presence of bistability , hysteresis , or limit cycles , which require sufficiently nonlinear interactions in addition to the right type of feedback [7] , [8] . A reasonable hypothesis is that multisite phosphorylation can give rise to ultrasensitive dose responses , in a way that would not be possible in a comparable single-site system [9]\u2013[13] . Many detailed mechanisms have also been proposed to explain the role of multisite systems in the emergence of bistability ( for examples , see [14] , [15] ) . On the other hand , such detailed multisite mechanisms are normally not used as part of actual mathematical models of biochemical interactions . This is because explicitly modeling multiple sites usually involves the introduction of numerous variables , one or more for each phosphorylation state , and realistic models are often too complex already to justify this additional effort . Systems that attempt to model biochemical reactions explicitly often use the assumption that the protein has two states , one active and one inactive , with a simple reaction to transform one into the other , effectively assuming that the protein only has one site . Other models are more phenomenological in nature and include , for example , Hill function terms in the equation that are less clearly tied to the actual biochemical reactions [16] , [17] . In this paper we describe a simple mechanistic approach for modeling multisite allosteric proteins . This approach , named modified fraction ( MF ) modeling , is capable of describing ultrasensitive dynamics without introducing a large number of additional variables . Under this framework one keeps track of the fraction of modified sites in the protein , and the concentration of active protein over time is estimated from this information . The protein is activated in a way that requires the phosphorylation of several but not all of the sites . The approximation becomes increasingly precise as the number of sites increases , with good estimates already for around four or more sites . In a sense , this mechanism can be considered a one-variable , quasi-steady state reduction of a model similar to the Monod-Wyman-Changeux allosteric system [18] , although uses of MF modeling outside of MWC are also possible . The MF framework can also be extended to other types of multisite modification such as ligand binding , multisite transcription factor regulation , multisite methylation or acetylation , ubiquitination , etc [19] , [20] . Perhaps the best way to test the versatility of a modeling tool such as the one proposed is to implement it in an actual biochemical system . In the current work we describe a detailed mechanistic model of a cell size checkpoint . Cell size checkpoints halt the cell cycle at specific points until sufficient cell growth has occurred [21] , [22] . The mechanisms by which cell size checkpoints operate are poorly understood , and it is unclear whether they monitor actual cell size or parameters more closely related to the extent or rate of growth . In budding yeast , growth of a new cell is initiated when a daughter bud is formed on the surface of the cell [23] . The daughter bud initially grows in a polar manner , with all growth directed to the bud tip . Growth of the bud eventually switches to isotropic growth , in which the bud grows over its entire surface ( see Figure 1A ) [24] . The timing of the switch determines the duration of polar growth , which influences cell size and shape . It has been proposed in recent work by one of the authors that a cell size checkpoint controls the timing of this switch [25] . This checkpoint is the subject of our model . The variables are illustrated in Figure 1B and described in more detail below . See Tyson and Novak [26] for an accessible introduction to the systems-wide modeling of cell cycle checkpoints . The MF approximation equation was first developed in [27] , in the context of multisite systems with independent modification sites , with an emphasis on the estimation of the Hill exponents of sequential and nonsequential systems and on the comparison of their qualitative behavior . A major advance of the current paper , beyond the application to the cell cycle checkpoint , is to extend this work to cooperative and allosteric systems . Such systems are by definition non-independent , since the modification of one site accelerates the rate of modification of its neighbors . Cooperative systems are also more common and much better characterized than independent ones . The validation of the approximation in cooperative systems is ultimately based on a computational comparison of the MF reduction with detailed cooperative models having or variables . In the first two Results sections we carry out a description of the modified fraction method to model multisite systems , and we compare simulations of the reduced model with those of a detailed mechanistic model . In the remaining two Results sections we carry out a mathematical analysis of the proposed checkpoint signaling pathway . We hypothesize that this interaction pathway has the capacity to produce a bistable signal responsible for a sudden switch from polar to isotropic growth , once the bud has undergone sufficient polar growth . The model presents several desirable qualities for a checkpoint , in particular a clear downstream signal when a sufficient polar bud growth has occurred . \n We start by describing the assumptions on our model in the context of multisite phosphorylation ( although it could also be applied to other irreversible covalent modifications as well as noncovalent ligand binding ) . Suppose that a protein substrate is phosphorylated by a kinase at possible sites and dephosphorylated by a phosphatase . The system is assumed to be nonsequential , so that there are different phosphoforms of , and the number of sites is thought to be relatively large e . g . . The system is cooperative in the sense that site phosphorylation accelerates the phosphorylation of neighboring sites . Since the number of sites is relatively large , the activation is thought to be cumulative and the effect of any individual site is assumed to be small . The sites are assumed to be equivalent to each other , in the sense that the rate of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation is similar across all sites and that no site has a stronger effect on substrate activation than other sites . The activation of the substrate may be due to binding to another molecule or body , such as the cell membrane . It could also be due to an internal structural change that allows the substrate to interact differently with other proteins . Thus the active protein concentration can be defined as the concentration of the protein bound to a particular molecule or in a particular molecular state . Suppose that the phosphorylations lead to the concerted , redundant activation of the protein . That is , multiple phosphorylations are necessary for activation ( concerted ) , and not all sites need to be phosphorylated for full activation ( redundant ) . We define the activity function such that the fraction of active protein with phosphorylated sites is given by . There are many systems that likely fall within this general framework . For instance , Ste5 is a scaffold protein in budding yeast with phosphorylation sites , which relays a pheromone response only when it is bound to the membrane [28] , [29] . When phosphorylated by Cdk1 , it tends to unbind from the membrane , shutting down its activity . The sites are predicted to lie on an unstructured region of the protein and appear to act by changing the protein's bulk electrostatic properties . In the paper [29] , it was shown through site-directed mutagenesis that around five or more phosphorylations are necessary and sufficient for deactivation . Another recent example is the multisite phosphorylation of Cdc25 by Cdk1 in fission yeast , which was similarly studied in detail by mutating individual sites [30] . According to the modified fraction framework , we estimate the concentration of a particular protein state from the overall fraction of modified sites . For instance , if the protein has sites and the fraction of phosphorylated sites is , then the fraction of protein with only the first and last sites phosphorylated is roughlyHere is the total protein concentration . This is not an equality since cooperative effects introduce correlations among the sites , i . e . the sites are not independent of each other , but it is an approximation assuming cooperative effects are sufficiently weak . Multiplying on both sides by and adding over all possible phosphoforms with phosphorylations , the concentration of proteins with exactly phosphorylated sites out of a total of sites isOne can estimate the overall concentration of active protein asA key aspect of this formula is that if we denote the right hand side by , it can be shown that converges to as increases [31] . This gives the approximation ( 1 ) which becomes increasingly precise for large . Notice that the different quantities in this formula can potentially be measured in the lab - the active protein concentration via an activity assay , the total protein concentration via Western blot , and the activity function through site-directed mutagenesis . A timescale decomposition argument can be made to use this approximation away from steady state . If is the fraction of active sites over time , and the timescale of protein activation is much faster than the rate at which changes , then one can approximate at any given time using the same formula . This produces a convenient method for modeling multisite systems under the given assumptions by keeping track of the variable , without creating , let alone variables . On the other hand , if , or any other process affecting protein activation , is at least as fast as protein activation itself , then nontrivial dynamics might take place such as limit cycle oscillations , and the approximation can introduce errors . It is necessary to calculate the fraction of phosphorylation itself . Assuming linear rates of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation for , one obtains the system That is , , where is the fraction of inactive sites . This is the default for the model , although any other rate equation for can be used , including Michaelis-Menten complex formation at the level of the individual sites . As for the activity function , any sigmoidal function can be used , including functions measured directly by experiments . By default we assume the following form , which we will derive in the next section: See also [5] , [9] , [27] for other uses and derivations of this formula in the literature . The function can actually be highly switch-like for large , which illustrates how small increases in the kinase can result in large activity changes in the protein , unlike linear rate models with only one site . Other forms for the activity function have effectively been considered by by Kapuy et al [32] , and also by Wang et al [10] . In Figure 2A we show the relationship between the fraction of phosphorylated sites and the active protein concentration for a particular choice of the MF parameters using the approximation formula ( and chosen to fit the detailed model described in the next section for ) . Notice that the activation is concerted and redundant , in that a minimal threshold of phosphorylation is required for activation , and activation is reached for less than full phosphorylation . A validation of the performance of this model for is now shown in Figure 2 in the context of a system similar to the classical and widely used Monod-Wyman-Changeux model of an allosteric multisite protein [18] . The original MWC model describes the binding of oxygen to the different sites of hemoglobin and the allosteric transitions of this protein between two different states . Rather than modeling oxygen binding , a protein with phosphorylations is assumed to change between an active conformation and an inactive conformation . Each of these forms can also be phosphorylated or dephosphorylated at the rates given in the diagram in Figure 2B . Although the model is interpreted in a different way from MWC , from a mathematical point of view it is almost identical . The coefficient accounts for an assumption that the protein is phosphorylated at a faster rate when it is active than when it is inactive . The coefficients etc represent the fact that this is still a nonsequential model: for instance , can be phosphorylated at different sites , so the phosphorylation rate is multiplied by . See the derivation of this model from more basic principles in Text S1 , and a recent review on multisite systems by one of the authors [28] . Using this multisite model , we now derive parameters for a corresponding MF model . For instance , one can define the \u2018average\u2019 phosphorylation rate at a given phosphorylation site , regardless of whether the protein is active or inactive , , and the dephosphorylation rate . By way of derivation of the activity function , suppose that a protein with phosphorylations is switching between active and inactive form , At steady state , we assume that this exchange is balanced and calculate . Then the fraction of active sites with phosphorylations at steady state isIn other words , where and . See Text S1 . 3 for more details . In particular , the ultrasensitive behavior of the function generally increases with the number of sites . At any given time , the active protein concentration of the full model is defined as . In Figure 2C we compare the full 12-variable MWC model for with the corresponding MF approximation . For every value of the input kinase concentration , the resulting concentration of active protein is plotted at steady state . Notice the close similarity between the two graphs , which is even more surprising since MF is essentially a one-variable model . For comparison , we also plot the behavior of an overly simplified but all too commonly used model , in which the substrate is assumed to have a single phosphorylation site instead of sites , and it is modeled according to the reactionusing linear reaction rates . Notice that the behavior of this single-site model in Figure 2C is very different from that of the MWC model , and that any switch-like behavior in the response is lost . This can have important consequences regarding the existence of multiple steady states , hysteresis , oscillations etc in the context of larger systems , which will be illustrated below . It is easy to show that , i . e . it corresponds to when . It should be noted that if the single site system is modeled using Michaelis-Menten reactions rather than linear rates , it could have strongly ultrasensitive behavior in the saturation regime via zero-order ultrasensitivity [33]; see the Discussion section for more details . We carried out a calculation of the distance between and for many different combinations of the number of sites and the allosteric parameter . For every such set of parameters , the two graphs were plotted at steady state as a function of , and the error was calculated in Figure 2D . Notice that the approximation is within 1% precision for arbitrary and . On the other hand , in order to obtain high ultrasensitivity it is required that be relatively large and/or be small ( Figure 2E ) . See also Figure S2 , where additional parameter variations are explored over four orders of magnitude using the same type of graphs , with similar results . It is worth comparing this methodology with the approach known in the literature as rule-based modeling , where a series of chemical reactions is defined using a streamlined algorithm , and high-powered computing is used to handle the resulting large number of variables; see e . g . BioNetGen [34] . The advantage of this method is that a large number of reactions can be defined and handled this way , including complex parameter optimizations . One disadvantage is that the combinatorial explosion resulting from combining reactions can sometimes exceed the computational power . Another is that the large number of equations makes any mathematical analysis difficult , if at all possible . It is interesting that the MWC model can actually be described in terms of rule-based modeling . In Figure S1A we describe a series of chemical reactions , over all possible phosphoform states , and we show in Text S1 that this system is in fact equivalent to the MWC model . Thus MF can also be seen as the 1-variable reduction of a system with variables and a much larger number of reactions . In this section , we will embed the MF system within increasingly complex systems of equations . We consistently use upper case for proteins and lower case for modified fractions of sites . However , we will first provide some technical experimental background regarding this specific pathway . In order to find the steady states of both subsystems together , recall that each one can be reduced to a single equation , so that the steady states correspond to the joint solution of the two equations . For fixed , the solutions of the full model form the intersection of the graphs for the equations ( 2 ) , ( 3 ) . This is illustrated in Figure 3F , where the graphs in Figure 3C and Figure 3E are superimposed on the same plane . From a control perspective , the upstream and downstream systems have each an input and an ouptut , and they feed back into each other ( see the two dotted boxes in Figure 1B ) . The active Zds1/PP2A dimer also acts as the overall output of the system , since it triggers the downstream response to cell cycle regulatory proteins . Although it is natural that an increase in the Rho1 flow can eventually trigger the activation of the pathway , the main focus here is not in the flow but in the overall Rho1 concentration at the bud tip . Given that Rho1 has a rate of growth proportional to and a linear rate of degradation , at steady state one can show that and are proportional , . This follows from adding the ODE rate equations at steady state , . In this way one can use the total Rho1 concentration as a bifurcation parameter at steady state even though it is simultaneously a variable in the system . Alternatively , since enzymatic reactions and dimer formation are fast processes compared with Rho1 flux and Rho1 degradation , one can let be the slow variable in the system and carry out a timescale decomposition analysis using as a constant [39] . Let's look at how the system has a hysteretic response for increasing values of the flow signal and the corresponding total Rho1 concentration at steady state . An increase in these values has the effect of raising the graph associated with the upstream system , as shown in Figure 4A . For smaller values of , the intersection of both graphs includes three positive steady states ( notice the two graphs don't quite intersect at the origin ) . But when increases over a certain threshold , the intersection of the two graphs contains a single positive steady state , with a large value of . This can cause an abrupt change in the qualitative behavior of the system , triggering a sudden increase in the Zds1/PP2A output . Once this change has taken place , the concentration of the output stays high even if the input decreases . Figure 4B shows a sample timecourse of the system for a time-variable vesicle flow ( dotted line ) . The total Rho1 concentration increases over time with the inflow of vesicles . At a certain timepoint the active Rho1 concentration abruptly increases , due to the switch at the Pkc1/Rho1 upstream level . An increase in Rho1/Pkc1 concentration some time before this can be seen in Figure 4C . At a later time the switch between Zds1 and PP2A is also triggered , leading to a sudden increase in PP2A/Zds1 concentration . Even under variable flow , the total Rho1 concentration roughly corresponds to the membrane accumulated at the bud , except for a certain amount of variability due to Rho1 degradation . Lowering the Rho1 degradation rate can decrease this difference . Notice that the vesicle flow oscillations do not correspond to cell division , but to oscillations in the rate of growth , for instance due to varying food availability . In Figure 4D we plot the output signal PP2A/Zds1 as a function of total Rho1 at steady state and overlay the solution of the timecourse simulation ( red stars ) . This graph also illustrates the hysteretic behavior of the system , in that once a critical threshold of Rho1 concentration is reached , the output signal is dramatically increased . This change would constitute a clear signal that the bud has reached a large enough size for crossing the polar/isotropic growth checkpoint . Since both the downstream ( PP2A , Zds1 ) switch and the upstream ( Rho1 , Pkc1 ) switch are driven by positive feedback loops , it is valid to ask which of the two loops is more relevant for the overall system behavior . We argue that it is the downstream loop that is more essential , using the bifurcation analysis in Figure 3 and Figure 4A . If the upstream system is not bistable but has a single steady state for every input , then the graph in Figure 3E is replaced by a single-valued decreasing function . Nevertheless this ( green ) line can still have one or three intersections with the ( blue ) downstream dose response in Figure 4A , indicating hysteresis for the overall system . On the other hand if the downstream system is not bistable , then the blue curve in Figure 4A is replaced by a single-valued , increasing function , which would be unlikely to have three intersection points with the ( green ) upstream dose response . Thus the downstream switch is essential , while the upstream switch is not . Notice that this system contains the standard elements of a signal transduction pathway , including an initiating signal ( vesicles ) , a sensor ( Rho1 ) , a series of transducers ( Pkc1 , PP2A , etc ) , and an effector ( active Zds1/PP2A ) . Total Rho1 is a proxy for the membrane concentration , even if bud growth slows for a period of time , and the cascade of reactions allows the signal to be transduced from the membrane to Zds1/PP2A and ultimately the cyclin dependent kinase . To ensure the high fidelity of the signal transmission [40] , the downstream signal is sent abruptly after total Rho1 concentration reaches a particular size . Notice that longer periods of inactivity can potentially reduce the Rho1 concentration significantly \u2013 one possible prediction is that after such a period the bud grows longer than expected . \n In this paper we have introduced a simple and compact framework to describe the dynamics of allosteric multisite phosphorylation systems , and we have applied this tool to a new molecular model of a size checkpoint in budding yeast . Multisite phosphorylation modeling can be problematic because ignoring the multiple sites can have significant effects in the dynamics , while introducing many auxiliary phosphoform variables can be cumbersome in more realistic models . The modified fraction approach is intuitive and flexible ( model the sites instead of the protein ) , and it only introduces one additional variable per protein . The components of the MF model , namely the function and the rates of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of individual sites , can potentially be subject to direct experimental measurement , unlike the use of more abstract Hill function terms . This can allow to carry out \u2018raw-data modeling\u2019 e . g . to use an experimentally measured activity function directly in the model rather than using it to derive parameters . This methodology is also useful out of equilibrium when the timescale of phosphorylation is sufficiently fast compared with other timescales in the system . There are several reasons why the MF method might be particularly suitable for modeling many multisite phosphorylation systems . Nonsequential phosphorylation is likely more common in nature than the more often modeled sequential systems , since enforcing sequential phosphorylations would require an additional mechanistic effort . Bioinformatic data suggests that most phosphorylation sites in multisite proteins are located in unstructured and unconserved protein regions [6] , suggesting that often it is the collective effect that matters rather than the individual sites . There is also experimental evidence in yeast signal transduction that certain proteins , such as Ste5 , are activated in a concerted and redundant manner , although this type of information is still unknown for most proteins . Notice that the approximation formula would still hold if the protein activation is not concerted or redundant . In that case the formula will just approximate a dose response that may not be ultrasensitive . One of the best known mechanisms for ultrasensitive dose responses is zero-order ultrasensitivity , as suggested by Goldbeter and Koshland [33] , [41] . Its main assumption is that substrate concentration needs to be in the saturation regime i . e . large compared to the value of the enzymes . The MF method does not pose any constraint on , in fact the linear regime we used can be found when substrate concentrations are small compared to values . Moreover , MF also applies when the enzymatic reactions involve complex formation , by writing a Michaelis-Menten equation for . Therefore zero-order ultrasensitivity can be used in synergy with MF in the saturation regime , and MF can be used regardless of value . A zero-order dose response could likely replicate the behavior of the MWC model as shown in Figure 2C , however it could not be considered a short hand notation for MWC since the two mechanisms are fundamentally different . In the case of the checkpoint pathway , the active proteins Pkc1 and PP2A have been found to have an approximate of 0 . 5 [42] and 1 . 2 [43] , respectively , for specific targets . The overall concentrations of their substrates in the cell are much lower - however these proteins tend to localize at the bud , so that the resulting local concentrations are unknown and it is unclear whether a zero-order approach would apply . A recent paper by Martins and Swain [44] points out that zero-order ultrasensitivity often results from low enzyme to substrate ratios , and localized proteins that act as enzymes and substrates for each other would likely not satisfy such ratios . That paper proposes instead a mechanism involving an allosteric model analogous to MWC , using enzyme sequestration to obtain ultrasensitivity . The paper by Kapuy et al [32] also proposes a mechanism for bistability through ultrasensitive effects , and this mechanism is applied to a detailed model of the budding yeast G1-S transition in Barik et al [45] . Other mechanisms for ultrasensitivity involve competition among substrates for the same enzyme [46] and protein localization [12] , among others [28] , [47] . More generally , in cell regulatory networks there is a need to implement nontrivial dynamics such as bistable switches and hysteresis , which requires some form of nonlinear response in addition to the right feedback interconnections . It has been observed that several regulatory proteins have multiple phosphorylation sites , and there are many open questions regarding their intended function . Together with the onerous nature of modeling several multisite proteins using sequential networks and multiple variables each , it can be seen why a one-variable reduction such as MF can allow for much-needed simplicity . The actual mechanisms regulating the interactions between cell size and cell division remain largely unanswered in many cases . This has left few alternative options apart from somewhat heuristic approaches in otherwise very detailed models , see e . g . [48] . The present model is an attempt , based on recent experiments , to construct a detailed mechanistic model in the context of the polar to isotropic bud transition in yeast . Notice that if the proteins PP2A , Pkc1 , Zds1 had only one site each , then according to the argument in the first Results section , and the downstream and upstream models could never be bistable ( see equations ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) ) . The multiple sites are providing the underlying nonlinearity so that the models can have interesting dynamical behaviors . This is consistent with the work by Yang et al [49] , which reached the same conclusion through randomized parameter searches in multisite cell cycle models . Also , the equations ( 2 ) , ( 3 ) , which represent the steady states of the downstream and upstream systems , have the same qualitative behavior for a wide range of parameters . In this sense one can say that the switch-like nature of the checkpoint is robust to many parameter changes , provided that a few key qualities are satisfied . The bistability in each subsystem is due in part to positive feedback loops in each subsystem , one between Pkc1 and the Rho1/Pkc1 dimer , and another between Zds1 and the PP2A/Zds1 dimer . Notice that while Rho1/Pkc1 activates PP2A , the downstream PP2A/Zds1 inactivates Pkc1 , forming a negative feedback loop . This feedback could serve to reduce the activity of the pathway before a sufficient Rho1 signal has accumulated . Notice that the switch-like activation of Cdk1 is a complex process that may well be regulated by other mechanisms in conjunction with the switch discussed , and that this overall regulation also depends on the organism studied . The MF framework eliminates several parameters such as the number of phosphorylation sites ( as long as it is sufficiently large ) , the transition rates and the cooperativity coefficient . The remaining parameters , such as the shape of the activity function , can potentially be measured in the lab using site-directed mutagenesis and activity assays . However this is still a formidable task and one that is yet to be done for most proteins involved in cell cycle regulation . Since it is assumed in the derivation of the formula ( 1 ) that the sites are roughly independent from each other , one might think that the MF framework doesn't work for allosteric or cooperative systems . However the detailed model in Figure 2 is allosteric , and yet the model closely describes its dynamics . In simulations we find that the accuracy of the representation is increased when is large ( e . g . ) and/or the cooperativity is weak . The use of a MWC-type model for multisite phosphorylation has been pointed out in the past , see for instance [5] and the more recent [44] . Questions for future work include the following: if phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of the multisite protein is not faster than other processes in the system , can one still approximate away from equilibrium ? This might be possible by defining a simple differential equation for instead of the algebraic equation ( 1 ) . Also , the linear dynamics used to calculate the fraction can be replaced by more complex models such as a Michaelis-Menten reaction , which may be explored in detail , including the interaction with zero-order mechanisms . This might lead to bistable behavior in the full multisite model , which raises the question of how the corresponding model reduction might be , possibly involving multivalued functions . \n Since most quantitative information about the pathway is unknown , we make educated estimates on the order of magnitude of the parameters . Since parameters are clustered in equations ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) , dependence on the parameters is more limited . Protein concentrations usually range from 0 . 001 to 10 in the cell . The concentrations of total PP2A ( ) , Zds1 ( ) and Pkc1 ( ) are set between 0 . 01 and 0 . 1 as indicated in Table 1 . Define for all . The dissociation rate has been observed to be quite low in experiments since most Zds1 has been found bound to PP2A . We set it as 0 . 001 , which is in the range of drugs binding to their target proteins . is set higher at 0 . 1 . The unit-less parameters are set to 0 . 1 and 1 respectively , indicating the steady state ratio of inactive to active substrate when the two antagonistic enzymes are in similar concentration . The rates are set to 0 . 01 , indicating that when e . g . there are equal amounts of active and inactive substrate at steady state . is set at 0 . 0002 . Very little is known about the values of the individual rates . Fortunately as it is shown in the analysis in Text S1 , most of the dynamic rate constants appear only in the form , instead of individually . These steady state ratios are generally easier to estimate experimentally than the individual parameters [50] . However the actual rates determine the transient behavior of the system and to some extent determine also its steady state values . Since a majority of the reverse rates share the same units of , we set the values of these parameters and then find the corresponding to fit the given ratio . For simplicity we set [14] , [51] . We set for maximal protein concentration , that is , . The Rho1 degradation rate is set to 0 . 0001 ; it can be further decreased in order to stabilize the Rho1 protein . Regarding the activity functions , we assume that the ultrasensitive behavior of these graphs increases with the number of phosphorylation sites; see the derivation of in the Results and also [5] . Since PP2A , Zds1 , and Pkc1 have been found to have around 3 , 5 , and 8 sites respectively , we implement this with parameters that produce the graph observed in Figure 3A . See Table 1 for a list of parameter values . The initial conditions used in the model correspond to the system in the off state . They are equal to zero for all variables , except and .", "headings": ["Abstract", "Introduction", "Results", "Discussion", "Methods"], "keywords": ["nonlinear dynamics", "systems biology", "biochemical simulations", "signal transduction", "mathematics", "mechanisms of signal transduction", "regulatory networks", "signaling networks", "biology", "molecular cell biology", "computational biology"], "id": "journal.pcbi.1003443"}

Recent studies indicate that certain patterns of local connectivity such as negative and positive feedback motifs are more frequently found in natural systems [1] , [2] . Despite their individual abilities to influence the flow of information , negative and positive feedback loops are often coupled together in natural systems . One example is the Xenopus embryonic cell cycle where a negative feedback loop and a pair of positive feedback loops control the operation of a robust tunable cell cycle oscillator [3] . Several synthetic oscillators have also been built to demonstrate the robust behavior that results from the interaction of various feedback motifs [4]\u2013[6] . In this paper , we examined network connectivity in a natural network which also employs a combination of negative and positive regulation and , at the same time , provides cell-cell communication among bacterial cells . Here , an auto-regulatory network is coupled with a double negative motif to provide a population based response known as bacterial quorum sensing ( QS ) . We examined the network connectivity and followed the propagation of the native signal molecule , autoinducer-2 ( AI-2 ) , in this system . Different regulatory motifs of the network were first studied in isolation by constructing mutant strains and were then combined to represent the system as a complete network . Using a combination of experimental work and mathematical modeling , we isolated the mechanisms of AI-2 transport into the cells and investigated how the interplay of the different feedback mechanisms orchestrates the overall cell-cell communication and population based regulation . Our experimental work predicted the existence of a new regulatory element that was not previously suggested . We tested our hypothesis by building a model based on the experimental results that also incorporated the new regulatory element . Our predication was captured well by the model and we were able to simulate both the intact network and all the sub-systems using our new proposed network architecture . Importantly , we revealed the mechanistic basis for the LsrR-mediated genetic \u201cswitch\u201d of E . coli QS circuitry . In the native system , the switch is buried but still effective . Our modeling results demonstrated the basis for and biological importance of a well-regulated network wherein a balance between the strengths of different feedback motifs is required for the proper functioning of the overall system . \n In general , QS can be described as a density-dependent cell-cell communication process among bacteria that is mediated by the transmission and propagation of chemical signals known as \u201cautoinducers\u201d [7]\u2013[9] . Autoinducers are synthesized within the cell cytoplasm , secreted to the outside and accumulate in the cells\u2019 immediate surroundings [10] . At a point associated with a \u201cquorum\u201d of cells , where the cell density and hence the concentration of the exported autoinducer reaches a threshold , the signaling molecules are transported back into the cells or are bound to cognate cell surface receptors , where they initiate coordinated changes in gene expression [11] . Several classes of signaling molecules and QS mechanisms have been identified [12] . The focus of this work was to investigate the transduction of autoinducer-2 ( AI-2 ) which is the dominate form of cell-cell communication in E . coli and S . Typhimurium . AI-2 is also suggested to be a \u201cuniversal\u201d signal molecule due to the presence of its terminal synthase in over 80 genera [8] . Figure 1 summarizes the AI-2 processing mechanism in E . coli ( for more detailed description , see [13] ) . During cell growth , AI-2 is synthesized through a multi-step enzymatic pathway and transported out of the cell membrane of individual bacterial cells [14] , [15] , Figure 1A . The increasing bacterial population results in the accumulation of AI-2 within the extracellular milieu . Once the concentration of AI-2 reaches a critical \u201cthreshold\u201d it is transported back into the cell [16] , [17] , triggering a coordinated genetic response , Figure 1B . Like many biological phenomena , the complexity of the interactions within the QS process , makes the detailed study of this system challenging . We used a \u201cbottom-up\u201d approach to reduce the complexity of the network by separating it into smaller sub-systems ( modules ) and examining each sub-system in isolation . A more comprehensive picture of the overall network behavior and their interactions could then be elucidated by combining the findings of these modules . We began by separating the AI-2 synthesis/export module from the AI-2 uptake/regulation module shown in Figure 1 . Since AI-2 synthesis has been modeled in previous work [13] , we focused on understanding the mechanisms of AI-2 transport back into the cell and its transduction/actuation potential . Experimentally , the two modules could be separated by removing one of the AI-2 synthase genes , luxS , from the genome and halting the in vivo AI-2 synthesis . AI-2 was then synthesized in vitro and its concentration estimated by measuring free thiol groups [18] . The synthesized AI-2 was then added to the system at different concentrations and dose response curves were determined . There are two significant advantages to using this in vitro approach . First , the separation of these two modules simplifies our analysis by eliminating cross-interaction between in vivo synthesized AI-2 and AI-2 that is transported in from the outside . The synthesized AI-2 was treated as an external input added into the system in defined concentrations and hence the exact amount of AI-2 present in the initial system was known . Second , this is a more quantitative approach to study QS mechanisms when compared to studies that rely on measurements of in vivo synthesized AI-2 . In vivo AI-2 studies typically performed using an indirect cell-based assay employing Vibrio harveyi bioluminescence [19] which has a high level of day-to-day variability and its irregularities have been noted [20] , [21] . As a result , we suggest that our approach is a more quantitative method for the purposes of characterizing network interactions within the QS system . The regulatory elements pertinent to the AI-2 uptake mechanism have been identified in a number of previous studies [15]\u2013[17] , [22] and are summarized in Figure 2A . External AI-2 is transported back into the cell through at least one known transporter , Lsr , encoded by the lsr-operon . The lsr-operon in E . coli encodes 6 genes that are responsible for the AI-2 uptake and modification mechanisms . The first four genes ( lsrA , lsrC , lsrD , and lsrB ) encode the import apparatus and the last two genes ( lsF , lsrG ) are putative AI-2 processing genes [17] , [22] that eliminate the activated form of AI-2 ( phospho-AI-2 or AI-2-P ) from the cytoplasm in a similar manner to that of S . Typhimurium with a highly homologous system [15] . Experimental evidence also indicates that in the absence of the Lsr transporter , AI-2 is can be transported into the cell via an as yet uncharacterized pathway [15] . To account for this unidentified transport mechanism , we included an alternative pathway ( denoted \u201cAlter\u201d ) in our scheme ( Figure 2A ) . Upon entering the cell , AI-2 is phosphorylated by a cytoplasmic kinase , LsrK , and the phosphorylated AI-2 interacts with a transcriptional regulator , LsrR [23] . LsrR inhibits transcription of the lsr-operon by binding to the lsr-operon promoter site . LsrR also acts an auto-regulator by binding the lsrR promoter site and inhibiting its own transcription [17] . Phospho-AI-2 reportedly binds the LsrR protein and prevents inhibition of the lsr-operon , hence alleviating repression and increasing Lsr transporter production . An increase in the levels of the Lsr transporter expedites AI-2 uptake and creates a positive feedback loop where higher concentrations of AI-2 within the cell result in an increase in AI-2 uptake . Figure 2B depicts the dose response curves for 7 different experiments in which various concentrations of AI-2 were added to growing cultures of E . coli cells that lacked the luxS gene . Expression levels from lsr-operon promoter , which indicate LsrR activity , were measured using a \u03b2-galactosidase ( \u03b2-gal ) assay , as described in the Materials and Methods . As expected , higher AI-2 levels resulted in higher expression rates from the operon . As cells reached the stationary phase , the expression levels of all cultures decreased as the in vitro AI-2 levels and the cells\u2019 metabolic activity also decreased . To better understand the role of each of the regulatory elements presented in Figure 2A and explain the experimental results of Figure 2B , our next step was to systematically remove each of the three key regulatory elements within the AI-2 uptake module and reduced the network into three sub-modules . Each sub-system was constructed by removing either lsrR , lsrK or lsr-operon genes from the genome of strains that already lacked the luxS gene . In each of these mutant strains we observed the expression level of the lsr-operon promoter as the output . In accordance with previous experimental work [17] ) and our experimental observations ( data not shown ) , the deletion of any of these genes has no affect on the cell growth . Once these sub-systems were analyzed in isolation , the individual sub-system responses were compared with the overall network response that was seen in Figure 2B . Our analysis , which is summarized in the following sections , predicted the existence of an additional lsr-regulatory mechanism and a new AI-2/protein interaction that had not been hypothesized ( or identified ) until now . The construction of the first sub-system involved the removal of the entire lsr-operon from a bacterial strain that already lacked the luxS gene , as shown in Figure 3A ( experimental details of gene deletion are provided in Materials and Methods ) . In this sub-network , AI-2 is not transported into the cell via the Lsr-operon transporter but it can still enter the cell using the alternative pathway [19] . The AI-2 which enters the cell via the Alter pathway , is phosphorylated by LsrK ( AI-2-P ) , binds the LsrR protein and prevents the repression of the lsr-operon promoter by LsrR . We experimentally monitored the flow of AI-2 by measuring the lsr-operon activity over time . Figure 3A shows the temporal responses of lsr-operon expression levels from 7 different cultures where various concentrations of in vitro AI-2 were added to the growing E . coli cultures . As the concentration of AI-2 increases , more AI-2-P is available to bind LsrR resulting in higher transcription from the lsr-operon promoter . This accounts for the higher expression levels observed for cultures that are induced with higher AI-2 concentrations . By 5 hr , most of AI-2 is taken up by the cell and the lsr-operon expression reaches its highest level . By 6 hr , external AI-2 is depleted and expression levels decline as cells enter the stationary phase . We observed one surprising result within this sub-system - that the levels of expression were higher without the lsr-operon ( Figure 3A ) compared to what was observed for the intact network ( Figure 2B ) , at the same concentrations of AI-2 . The highest level of sub-network 1 was \u223c200 Miller units compared to the overall system behavior ( \u223c70 Miller units ) . The second sub-system was built by removing the lsrR gene from a bacterial strain that already lacked the luxS gene ( shown in Figure 3B ) . Without the presence of the repressor protein , LsrR , the lsr-operon is not repressed and AI-2 can enter the cell via both the lsr-operon and the alternative pathway . According to this model depiction , the expression level of the lsr-operon is independent of the AI-2 levels and we expected to see high levels of expression from the lsr-operon irrespective of the concentration of AI-2 . Figure 3B represents the time response of three cultures grown with different levels of AI-2 . Contrary to our prediction , the expression levels were not as high as , nor higher than , those seen in Figure 3A . Further , the system appeared to have a slight dependency on AI-2 concentration as higher levels of expression were found for higher AI-2 concentrations . The last sub-system was built by removing the lsrK gene from the isogenic parent strain . Without the LsrK protein and the corresponding AI-2-P in the system , LsrR is free to fully repress the lsr-operon . Therefore , we expected that the lsr-operon expression levels should be low regardless of input AI-2 concentrations . Figure 3C represents the experimental data for 2 samples at both low and high concentrations of AI-2 . In agreement with our expectations , the expression levels were both low . The result shown in Figure 3A and 3B indicated that the lsr-operon mutant ( Figure 3A ) had higher expression levels than the parent strain ( Figure 2B ) and that lsrR mutant response ( Figure 3B ) had a slight dependency on AI-2 concentration ( Figure 3B ) . These observations suggested that the perceived network architecture as presented in Figure 2A might not be an accurate depiction of the overall system behavior . Other regulatory elements and possible feedback mechanisms , not identified in previous studies , may be involved in the AI-2 uptake/transduction process . In order to account for such regulations , we constructed a mathematical model of our network and its sub-systems . We started by modeling the AI-2 uptake by the cell and its downstream regulation that were depicted in Figure 2A . Table 1 and 2 summarize the details of this first model . The synthesis of LsrR and Lsr-operon were each modeled by a single equation ( Eq . 1 & 2 , Table 1 ) where protein synthesis , decay , cooperative binding and repression were all encompassed in a single equation . AI-2 delivery to the cell was modeled by an active transport of AI-2 by the Lsr-operon and also an alternative pathway that was represented by a simple flux ( Eq . 3 , & 4 , Table 1 ) . Our experiments have indicated that the presence of LsrK is essential to the operation of this network and that in the absence of this kinase the system is shut down . Moreover a kinetic analysis of LsrK activity in a recent paper [24] has shown that the phosphoralytion of AI-2 is rapid and is completed within a few minutes . As a result , to simplify the network description we made the assumption that all the imported AI-2 was phosphorylated ( denoted as Ap in the model ) . AI-2 interaction and binding to LsrR was modeled as a formation of a complex and its eventual decay ( Eq . 5 , Table 1 ) . Initial concentration of all variables , except AI-2 , was set to zero ( Table 2 ) . AI-2 was modeled as an input to the system and its concentration varied over a range of 1 to 40 uM to match the in vitro AI-2 concentration used in our experiments . A deterministic solution to the system of ordinary differential equations presented in Table 1 was evaluated using the freely available software COPASI [25] . In the deterministic framework , COPASI calculates time course by using a LSODA integrator [26] that will numerically evaluate a solution to the system . Since few empirical data on the kinetic parameters of this system was available , a parameter estimation routine was used to fit and match the model to the experimental data shown in Figure 2B . A global parameter estimation routine based on a least-squares method and a direct search algorithm [25] , [27] was used to minimize the distance between experimental data and this first model . The parameterization routine ( the range of parameters are listed in Table S3 ) was performed on all the kinetic parameters that are listed in Table 2 with the exception of protein decay which was set to cell division time . This assumption is valid as the proteins in this network are generally stable and have half-lives that are much larger than the cell division time [17] . The cell division time was set to 30 minutes based on previous experiments performed in our laboratory and the understanding that mutations do not affect cell growth [17] , [22] . Table 2 lists the kinetic parameters that provided the best correlation to the experimental result of Figure 2B . Figure S1 represents the dynamic response of this corresponding first model for 10 AI-2 concentrations as described in Text S1 . As it is evidence from these graphs this model is a good representation of the experimental data . We then used the same model parameters to simulate the response of the sub-systems that are presented in Figure 3 . The result of these simulations ( time responses are shown in Figure S2 ) was not a good representation of the experimental data . In the model , in the absence of Lsr-operon , the AI-2 uptake is significantly impaired and LsrR is able to repress the operon expression level to very low levels . Since our experimental results of Figure 3A were unexpected , it was not a surprise that the model also did not reproduce the experimental data and that we were unable to simultaneously reproduce the experimental results observed in Figure 2B and Figure 3 . A global parameter estimation routine revealed that , using the same model description , several parameters such as k1 , k2 and nR needed to be significantly changed in order to reproduce Figure 3A or 3B alone . In order to rectify these discrepancies , several different network topologies were considered as possible alternative configurations for this system . For example the Lsr-operon transport and the alternative pathway might work as mutually exclusive switches where in the presence of Lsr-operon the alternative pathway is shut down . There is also the possibility that LsrR has other regulatory roles in the network that are not well understood . One interaction that was hypothesized and showed promise in our preliminary evaluations was the existence of a second regulatory mechanism ( in addition to LsrR ) that controls the transcription of the lsr-operon . In theory , an lsr-regulator protein may act as a negative regulatory mechanism to repress the activity of the lsr-operon promoter site . The original model ( denoted first model ) was modified to include this interaction . The modification involved introducing a protein named \u201cREG\u201d as a second repressor in the system and adding a repression term within the Lsr-operon synthesis equation . A new parameter estimation routine was performed to correlate the model with both the experimental result shown in Figure 2B and Figure 3 simultaneously . The new model allowed us to replicate the experimental results in Figure 2B and 3A quite well ( time courses shown in Figure S3 and explained in Text S1 ) but it did not support the weak dependency of lsr-operon expression on AI-2 that was demonstrated in Figure 3B . We looked for other possible scenarios that could account for this apparent weak dependency on AI-2 in the absence of LsrR . One possible explanation , as shown in Figure 4A , is that the lsr-regulator [28] , similar to LsrR , could bind AI-2-P and reduce the repression of the lsr-operon in the presence of high concentrations of AI-2 . This could result in higher expression levels from the promoter in the absence of lsr-operon ( seen in Figure 3A ) and an increase in expression levels with the addition of AI-2 ( seen in Figure 3B ) . This is conceptually feasible , as described later , as REG protein processing can both eliminate AI-2-P as a positive regulator over long periods of time and it can also sequester AI-2-P while it is bound . Using the described network architecture ( Figure 4A ) we were able to produce simulation results that matched all our experimental results closely ( see Figure S4 for time response simulations ) . Table 3 describes the new set of equations in this modified model and Table 4 lists all the kinetic parameters that were used . In order to show the comparison between the model and experiments more clearly we plotted the promoter activity as a function of the AI-2 concentrations at a single time point ( time of maxima in simulations shown in Figure S4 and experiments shown in Figure 2 and 3 ) as shown in Figure 4B and 4C respectively . This representation captures the effect of AI-2 on individual sub-networks and at the same time allows us to compare the different sub-networks within the network . Our simulation results matched our experiments closely and indicated the possible existence of the interaction between the lsr-operon , its own promoter and the AI-2-P . After a close examination and deciphering of the AI-2 uptake mechanism it was interesting to go back and compare our results with the responses of wild-type E . coli . We compared the lsr-operon expression level of luxS knock-out cells ( \u2212/+ in vitro AI-2 ) with the wild-type expression levels . Expression levels for the wild-type and the high in vitro AI-2 supplemented cases were similar ( Figure 5A , left y-axis ) . For reference , we depicted the measured AI-2 activity of V . harveyi within the extracellular milieu of the cultivated wild-type cells on the same graph ( Figure 5A , right y-axis ) . As expected , AI-2 is accumulated and upon reaching a threshold , it is transported back into the cell . The highest level of AI-2 activity for the wild-type cells , measured through the AI-2 assay ( see Materials and Methods ) , was around 200 units of luminescence . We then measured the activity levels of different in vitro AI-2 concentrations to find the level of in vitro AI-2 that yielded expression levels as that in the in vivo synthesized AI-2 case ( Figure 5B ) . To our surprise , we noticed that an in vitro concentration of only 4 \u00b5M gave similar AI-2 activity as the wild-type . For the higher in vitro AI-2 concentrations we observed greater luminescence ( around 1 , 000 units of luminescence ) . According to our results in Figure 2B , 4 \u00b5M of in vitro AI-2 can only marginally de-repress the lsr-operon and the expression levels of the promoter in this case are much lower than what is seen in the wild-type strain . This is a very important observation as it points out the possibility that AI-2 might not be completely exported out of the cell in the wild-type cells and that the internally made AI-2 might also contribute to the regulatory mechanisms of AI-2 uptake [17] , [29] . Furthermore , in addition to being a signaling molecule , AI-2 might have other regulatory and metabolic roles within the cell . Further investigation of the internal AI-2 is required to shed light on some of these observations . \n The AI-2 uptake mechanism , which is one of the two main modules in the AI-2-mediated QS system in E . coli , was taken apart in this work and the sub-systems were analyzed in isolation . We separated our original network architecture into simpler modules , examined each module separately and this led to the speculation of new regulatory interactions within the network . Several different interactions including the existence of other active transports , a mutually exclusive switch like behavior of the Lsr-operon transport and the alternative pathway and enzymatic activity of other proteins that might degrade AI-2 were all considered and examined in a preliminary test . One scenario that showed promise was the case in which an lsr-regulator protein would interact with the lsr-operon promoter site and act as a negative regulator ( based on the results obtained in Figure 2B and 3A ) . In addition the response of the lsrR knock-out strains ( Figure 3B ) suggested a possible interaction of the lsr-regulator protein with AI-2-P . These new interactions were incorporated into the construction of a comprehensive system of ordinary differential equations , details of which are summarized in Tables 3\u20134 . Four types of regulations played an important role in determining the outcome of this model i ) the LsrR repression of the lsr-operon ( represented by k1 ) , ii ) the auto-regulatory effect of LsrR on its own promoter sites ( represented by k2 ) , iii ) interaction of lsr-regulator ( REG protein ) with the lsr-operon promoter site ( represented by k4 ) , and iv ) AI-2-P binding to LsrR and REG ( represented by k3 and k5 ) . The regulation of LsrR and REG ( negative feedback motifs ) were coupled with the AI-2-P binding of the LsrR and REG ( where the binding acts as de-repressing mechanism and hence has an overall positive feedback effect ) to give this network a combination of both negative and positive feedback regulation . Our modeling results indicated that only with in a specific range of kinetic rates we were able to produce the desired response that correlated well with all the experimental results . The best correlation between the model and the experiments occurred when the relative affinity of the LsrR for the lsrR promoter was of the same order as the LsrR affinity for the lsr-operon promoter . This indicates that LsrR has similar binding affinity for its own promoter and the lsr-operon promoter site and that a competitive dynamics exists within this network architecture to bind LsrR repressor protein . The degree of regulation of the lsr-operon by REG protein was less than the LsrR auto-regulation strength and the binding affinity of AI-2 for the lsr-regulator was also lower than its affinity for the LsrR protein . This indicates that LsrR plays a more significant role in regulating the dynamics of the QS network suggesting that this protein might be involved in other metabolic pathways within the cell as speculated by others [29] . Our further analysis of the system revealed that the in vitro AI-2 levels required to produce similar effects on the system are very high compare to what is expected based on the secretion of in vivo AI-2 . This observation suggests that AI-2 might have other regulatory roles within the cells that are still unknown . The two most important revelations in this work are: the apparent negative feedback regulation on the lsr-regulator that is as strong as or stronger than that of the LsrR protein , and the uncovering of the strength of the Lsr \u201cswitch\u201d . Negative regulation is a recurring motif in biological networks and previous works have shown that this motif is able to reduce transcriptional noise in single genes and cascades [30]\u2013[32] and increase the fidelity of signal transmission in biological networks [33] , [34] . In our case , the mechanistic basis for the lsr-regulator\u2019s effect on repression is only partially explained . The regulator\u2019s processing of AI-2-P would understandably sequester and reduce AI-2-P , enabling higher transcription of the lsr-operon . However , our conjecture that an lsr-regulator is repressing the promoter site via direct binding or other mechanism is supported by several currently disjoint observations . First , we found LsrR binding to both the lsrR and lsr-operon promoters were predicted to be similar in strength . This suggests coordination between LsrR proteins , which would be feasible if LsrR operates as a dimer [35] and these sites are brought into proximity . Additionally , since the data from the lsr-operon mutant are significantly higher than the lsrR mutant , the net effect should be the recruitment of other factors , not currently considered . We hypothesize two such scenarios: first , we have shown here the effects of in vivo AI-2 are significantly different than imported and phosphorylated AI-2 . We have also demonstrated that unphosphorylated AI-2 plays a role in modulating LsrR regulated gene expression [29] . In the lsr-operon mutant , AI-2 is transported into the cell via alternative pathway , presumably phosphorylated by LsrK , but not degraded by LsrFG . This will alter the relative ratio of AI-2 and AI-2-P which might influence lsr expression in an as yet undetermined manner . Second , in ours [17] and Bassler\u2019s previous report [16] there is significant interplay between CRP and lsr expression , and binding sites in the intergenic region were revealed . Perhaps the lsr-operon and the AI-2-P state alter the effects of CRP in this regulatory switch . We note that the presence of glucose completely shuts off lsr expression and swamps the QS regulation mediated by LsrR [17] . The second most important revelation was that the LsrR \u201cswitch\u201d , in fact , is significantly stronger when turned on in sub-networks than in the wild-type cells . In effect , we have found the levels of AI-2 needed to toggle this switch and hypothesize that it might be of use in guiding phenotype . Switch-like behavior is a common phenotype of network topologies that have some degree of positive regulation or feedback [36] , [37] and in our case the binding of the repressor protein to AI-2-P effectively plays this role and is the further evidence of the existence of a switch . Our work is the first study of QS wherein a combination of double knock-outs and in vitro synthesized AI-2 have been used to quantify gene regulation in the E . coli AI-2 system . We showed that using a bottom-up approach and isolating the important regulatory elements is an effective way to analyze a natural biological network especially when positive and negative regulations exist within the network architecture . We also showed that the study of such isolated modules allows one to construct a hypothetical model of the system and use simulations to predict the existence of new regulatory mechanisms . Further analysis of this network architecture will shed light on other regulatory pathways within the metabolic networks of bacterial cells and may be used to guide phenotypes in new ways as the quorum sensing switches become incorporated into various biotechnological applications . \n The bacterial strains used in this study are listed in Table S1 . Luria-Bertani broth [38] contained 5 g of yeast extract ( Sigma ) liter\u22121 , 10 g of Bacto tryptone ( Difco ) liter\u22121 , and 10 g of NaCl liter\u22121 . Media were supplemented with antibiotics at the following concentrations: Ampicillin , 20 \u00b5g ml\u22121; Kanamycin , 10 \u00b5g ml\u22121 and Chloramphenicol 10 \u00b5g ml\u22121 . The one-step replacement method described by Datsenko and Wanner [39] was used to construct a luxS deletion in E . coli strains LW8 , LW9 and LW11 . The phage \u03bbRed recombination system was used to replace the luxS gene with a luxS::Crm PCR fragment . pKD3 plasmid was used as PCR template with primers luxSHP1 and luxSHP1 ( Table S2 ) . The PCR products were then treated with DpnI and introduced by electroporation into E . coli LW8 , LW9 or LW11 strains containing pKD46 plasmid . The strains were then grown in 37\u00b0C for an hour . Recombinants were selected on LB plates supplemented with Kanamycin and Chloramphenicol . The deletion of the genes was verified by PCR tests . Cultures of E . coli were grown overnight in LB , diluted 100-fold into fresh LB , grown to the OD600 below 0 . 05 . The cultures were incubated at 37\u00b0C with shaking at 250 rpm and grown for 1 hour . AI-2 was then added to the system and samples were places back in the incubator . Samples were removed at hour intervals for determination of the OD600 and \u03b2-galactosidase activity using the Miller method [40] . The Specific activity of \u03b2-galactosidase was expressed in Miller units [40] . Cell-free culture fluids were prepared by centrifugation of the E . coli samples culture at 10 , 000 rpm for 5 min in a microcentrifuge . Cleared supernatants were filtered ( 0 . 2 \u00b5m size HT Tuffryn filters; Pall Corp . , Ann Arbor , Mich . ) and stored at \u221220\u00b0C . These cell-free culture media were tested for the presence of AI-2 by inducing luminescence in Vibrio harveyi reporter strain BB170 . The assays were performed as outlined by [41] .", "headings": ["Abstract", "Introduction", "Results", "Discussion", "Materials and Methods"], "keywords": ["biotechnology", "bioengineering", "systems biology", "biological systems engineering", "biology", "computational biology", "genetics and genomics", "engineering"], "id": "journal.pcbi.1002172"}
{"lay_summary": "Despite the progress made in the last decade , malaria remains a serious public health issue in sub-Saharan region , where it overlaps with helminths infections . The interactions between both are manifold and complex , requiring further investigation . We report here that Trichuris trichiura or hookworm associated with schistosomiasis increase the risk of Plasmodium falciparum infection; whilst schistosomiasis is independently associated with a malaria increase in young children , but not in the older children . Our finding is an additional evidence that optimizing helminth control mainly in children contributes to overcoming malaria in areas endemic for both parasitic infections where children are those who bear the highest burden of these infections .", "article": "Malaria burden remains high in the sub-Saharan region where helminths are prevalent and where children are often infected with both types of parasites . Although the effect of helminths on malaria infection is evident , the impact of these co-infections is not clearly elucidated yet and the scarce findings are conflicting . In this study , we investigated the effect of schistosomiasis , considering soil-transmitted helminths ( STH ) , on prevalence and incidence of Plasmodium falciparum infection . This longitudinal survey was conducted in school-age children living in two rural communities in the vicinity of Lambar\u00e9n\u00e9 , Gabon . Thick blood smear light microscopy , urine filtration and the Kato-Katz technique were performed to detect malaria parasites , S . haematobium eggs and , STH eggs , respectively . P . falciparum carriage was assessed at inclusion , and incidence of malaria and time to the first malaria event were recorded in correlation with Schistosoma carriage status . Stratified multivariate analysis using generalized linear model was used to assess the risk of plasmodium infection considering interaction with STH , and survival analysis to assess time to malaria . The overall prevalence on subject enrolment was 30% , 23% and 9% for S . haematobium , P . falciparum infections and co-infection with both parasites , respectively . Our results showed that schistosomiasis in children tends to increase the risk of plasmodium infection but a combined effect with Trichuris trichiura or hookworm infection clearly increase the risk ( aOR = 3 . 9 [95%CI: 1 . 7\u20139 . 2] ) . The incidence of malaria over time was 0 . 51[95%CI: 0 . 45\u20130 . 57] per person-year and was higher in the Schistosoma-infected group compared to the non-infected group ( 0 . 61 vs 0 . 43 , p = 0 . 02 ) , with a significant delay of time-to first-malaria event only in children aged from 6 to 10-years-old infected with Schistosoma haematobium . Our results suggest that STH enhance the risk for P . falciparum infection in schistosomiasis-positive children , and when infected , that schistosomiasis enhances susceptibility to developing malaria in young children but not in older children . \n Over the past fifteen years , morbidity and mortality due to malaria have globally decreased . However , sub-Saharan Africa , where 90% cases of malaria and 92% of deaths related to malaria have occurred in 2015 , still bears the highest burden of the disease [1] . Most of these cases remain confined to rural and semi-urban areas [2\u20134] where helminths are co-prevalent [5\u20137] . In these areas where malaria significantly overlaps with helminth infections , several studies have reported interactions between the two parasitic infections at both immunological [8\u201312] and epidemiological [13\u201316] levels . Studies have reported an effect of helminths on the cellular and humoral immune responses to the malaria parasites mainly in children [8\u201312 , 17] . Some authors have reported that this effect leads to the aggravation of clinical manifestations of malaria . Indeed , it has been shown that Trichuris trichiura infection was associated with increased malaria prevalence , while an increased helminth burden was associated with increased Plasmodium falciparum or Plasmodium vivax parasitemia [18] , or enhanced anemia in co-infected children [19] . Another author has reported a positive effect of helminths on malaria outcomes . Indeed , Nacher et al found that helminths , particularly Ascaris , may have a role in the establishment of malaria tolerance in Thai patients [20] . However HIV co-infection complicated the picture further . Indeed , high prevalences of helminth infections and malaria have been reported in HIV positive people , particularly in pregnant women under anti-retroviral therapy ( ART ) in Rwanda [21\u201323] with 10% co-infections with both [23] . These high infection prevalences are found to be associated with a low CD4 counts and moreover , each of these infections is a risk factor for the other [22] . The situation is similarly unclear when it comes to Schistosoma spp . infections . It has been reported that the effect of schistosomiasis on malaria may depend on the Schistosoma species [24] , or may be conflicting even for the same species [15 , 25\u201327] . Indeed , some reports have indicated that infection with S . haematobium can confer protection against severe malaria in children [25] , reducing the risk of progression to symptomatic disease in long-term asymptomatic carriers of P . falciparum [15] , or can delay the occurrence of a malaria episode in children [26]; whereas others found that S . haematobium may increase the prevalence of P . falciparum parasites in co-infected children [27] . In contrast , Schistosoma mansoni was reported to significantly increase the malaria incidence rate in children [28] . These finding provide evidence of the effect of schistosomiasis on Plasmodium infection . Current results on schistosomiasis and plasmodial co-infection are conflicting as reviewed recently by Adegnika et al . [24] . Most studies conducted to address these co-infections are cross-sectional in nature and could be limited in their capacity to precisely examine interactions between schistosomiasis and malaria . In this study , we conducted a longitudinal survey in order to address this issue in an area where S . haematobium and P . falciparum are the main prevalent species of schistosomiasis and malaria [13 , 14] . We thus assessed the effect of S . haematobium on clinical and parasitological aspects of P . falciparum infection in school aged children living in this co-endemic area , including the effect of soil-transmitted helminths ( STH ) in this association . \n The study was approved by the institutional ethics committee of CERMEL , reference number: CEI-MRU 002/2012 . Parents or legal representatives of the participant gave a written informed consent . The study was conducted in line with the Good Clinical Practice ( GCP ) principles of the International Conference on Harmonisation ( ICH ) [29] and the Declaration of Helsinki [30] . The study took place at CERMEL ( Centre de Recherches M\u00e9dicales de Lambar\u00e9n\u00e9 ) . Data and samples were collected from May 2012 to December 2014 in Bindo-Makouk\u00e9 villages ( BM ) and Zil\u00e9-PK villages , two settlements in the vicinity of Lambar\u00e9n\u00e9 [14] situated approximately at 60 km and 120 km , respectively , to the South of the Equator . The rainfall is perennial except for the long dry season ( from June to September ) with a mean of 1 , 216 mm per year [31] . The region is irrigated by the Ogoou\u00e9 River and its tributaries , with many ponds , lakes and streams constituting favourable conditions for fresh-water snail habitation . Recent published data demonstrate that the prevalence in the area for S . haematobium range from 15% to 75% [9 , 13 , 14] . Water supply , fishing , household work , fetching water and playing are some activities which expose the local population to schistosomiasis . Malaria transmission is perennial and the dominant malaria parasite species is P . falciparum [32 , 33] . The study was designed as a prospective longitudinal study . School-age children living in two vicinities of Lambar\u00e9n\u00e9 ( Nzil\u00e9-PK villages and Bindo-Makouk\u00e9 villages ) were invited to participate in the study . Volunteers without any known chronic diseases other than possible helminth co-infections , and living in the study area for at least one year before inclusion were eligible to take part to the study . During the survey , participants found with a recurrent or severe disease other than malaria or helminth infection were excluded from the study . A previous study conducted in the vicinities of Lambar\u00e9n\u00e9 reported a 42% prevalence for plasmodium infection among school age children [9] . To be able to detect a minimum of 12 . 5% prevalence difference of plasmodium infection between children with schistosomiasis and those without , with a minimum of 80% power , we needed to include in the study at baseline at least 249 children for each study group , giving a total of 498 volunteers school age children . Field-workers went to each house and school of both villages to invite through their parents or legal representatives school-age children to participate in the study . Eligible and consenting volunteers were included . At baseline , demographics ( age , sex and location ) and anthropological ( weight , height ) data were collected . Axillary temperature was recorded . S . haematobium infection , P . falciparum infection and soil-transmitted helminths ( STH ) status were assessed . Participants were treated if they were found to harbour either of those parasitic infections . The follow-up consisted of two kinds of visit: active visits consisted of monthly home visits for any malaria-like symptoms assessment and recording of any medication intake; and passive visits were ad-hoc presentations of participating children at the research centre for any health issues , including flu-like symptoms . Malaria status was defined as positive thick blood smear ( TBS ) associated with fever , or history of fever in the past 48h from the time of visit . Fever was defined as an axillary temperature of 37 . 5\u00b0C or higher . In case malaria was diagnosed , urine filtration was performed to assess evidence of co-infection with urogenital schistosomiasis . Urine filtration was also performed during the follow-up every time the children had visible haematuria . Study groups were determined based on the schistosomiasis status . This was done differently for baseline analysis and for longitudinal analysis . At baseline and for baseline analysis , participants found infected with S . haematobium were assigned to the \u2018Schistosoma-positive\u2019 ( S+ ) group and the others to the \u2018Schistosoma-negative\u2019 ( S- ) group . For longitudinal analysis , study groups were formed at the end of the follow-up period , and we assigned any participants found with infection at baseline and at any time point of the study course to the \u2018Schistosoma-infected\u2019 ( SI ) group . Those found negative at baseline and who did not experienced schistosomiasis during the study course were assigned to the \u2018Schistosoma-uninfected\u2019 ( SU ) group . Time of exposure to malaria infection for incidence calculation did not include the first 28 days after each malaria treatment . In accordance with the national guidelines , treatment of schistosomiasis consisted of the administration of 40 mg of praziquantel per kilogram body weight once; asymptomatic P . falciparum parasitemia and malaria episodes were treated with tablets of 20/120mg of artemether-lumefantrine combination therapy given according to the body weight twice a day , in three consecutive days . Treatment of STH was a once-daily dose of 400 mg of albendazole for three consecutive days [34] . For any other cause of a disease episode , the participant was referred to the appropriate health centre . Detection of malaria parasites was done microscopically by TBS using the Lambar\u00e9n\u00e9 method as described elsewhere [35\u201337] . Detection of S . haematobium eggs was done by filtration of 10ml of fresh urine using a 12\u03bcm pore-size filter as previously described [38\u201340] . For the diagnosis of urogenital schistosomiasis , urine samples were collected over three consecutive days , unless the participant was found positive with at least one parasite egg in any sample before the second or the third day . The Kato-Katz technique was performed to assess the presence of A . lumbricoides , T . trichiura and hookworm in fresh stool samples [41] . For each time point of STH assessment , one stool sample was collected . For each stool sample , two slides were performed and each slide was independently read by two readers . Data were captured on the patient report form ( PRF ) , entered in Access 2013 software and transferred to R software version 3 . 2 . 4 for analysis . Univariate and multivariate analysis were performed applying the Generalized Linear Model ( GLM ) . For multivariate analysis , first we considered the interaction between asymptomatic P . falciparum infection as the main variable and each explanatory variable . In case of effect measure modification , the analysis was stratified on the variable , and the Breslow test was done to assess the homogeneity of the strata . Otherwise , the variable was evaluated as confounding factor to be include in the final model . Ten per cent ( 10% ) or more difference of estimated measure of association before and after adjustment was used to define confounding factors . The effect of STH infection was assessed separately with respect to the species . Incidence of malaria was estimated in person-year according to each variable . A Kaplan Meier curve was drawn to assess time-to-malaria occurrence . The Log-rank test was used to compare the curves and the Cox model was used for adjusted analysis . \n Among the participants who were invited to participate in the study , informed consent was granted for 754 children by their parents or their legal representatives . Of those , a total of 739 children with schistosomiasis and P . falciparum status available were included at baseline ( Fig 1 ) . Among participants enrolled , 68 ( 9% ) children were not able to provide sample stool at baseline and from the others , 31% [95%CI: 27%-35%] were infected with STH . The most prevalent infection was trichuris with 21% [95%CI: 18%-24%] followed by ascaris and hookworm with 19% [95%CI: 16%-22%] and 6% [95%CI: 5%-8%] , respectively . Mean age of these study population was 10 . 4 ( SD = 3 . 1 ) years , the boy-to-girl sex ratio was 1 . 1:1 ( Table 1 ) . Of participants included , 586 ( 79% ) agreed to be followed-up for malaria incidence . The prevalence of P . falciparum and S . haematobium at baseline was 23% [95%CI: 20%-26%] and 30% [95%CI: 27%-34%] , respectively; with 67 ( 9% , [95%CI: 07%-11%] ) participants co-infected with both parasites . Eight per cent of participants infected with P . falciparum had fever . As shown in Table 2 , both infections were more prevalent in Zil\u00e9-PK villages compared to Bindo and Makouk\u00e9 villages with 29% [95%CI: 24%-34%] vs 18% [95%CI: 14%-22%] , respectively , for P . falciparum and 45% [95%CI: 40%-51%] vs 19% [95%CI: 15%-23%] , respectively , for S . haematobium . The prevalence of both infections was similar for age and sex groups . Among the participants followed-up for malaria incidence assessment , 216 ( 37% ) were found positive for Schistosoma infection during the study period , including 176 cases on inclusion and additionally 40 new cases during follow-up and assigned to SI group . The 368 ( 63% ) others participants who remained negative during the whole study course were thus assigned to the SU group ( Fig 1 ) . As shown in Table 3 , the two study groups were comparable for all parameters except for location and P . falciparum parasite carrier status . Indeed , 168 ( 78% ) of SI children came from Zil\u00e9-PK villages while 253 ( 69% ) of SU children came from Bindo and Makouk\u00e9 villages ( p<0 . 001 ) . Additionally , prevalence of P . falciparum parasite carriage was significantly higher in the SI group compared to the SU group ( 31% vs 20% , p = 0 . 004 ) . At crude analysis as given in Table 4 , Schistosoma infection ( p = 0 . 002 ) and location ( p<0 . 001 ) were associated with P . falciparum infection . Children infected with S . haematobium had a 1 . 8 [95%CI: 1 . 2\u20132 . 5] times odds of being co-infected with P . falciparum parasites compared to their non-infected counterpart . After adjustment ( Table 4 ) , P . falciparum infection remains associated only with location ( p = 0 . 02 ) while a trend of association with schistosomiasis infection was found ( p = 0 . 06 ) . In the following analysis , we found effect modification of Trichuris or hookworm infections on P . falciparum and S . haematobium infections association . As presented in Table 5 , analysis stratified on those two infections showed that among study participants without T . trichiura and hookworm infections , there is no effect of S . haematobium on P . falciparum parasite carriage; while among those infected with either hookworm or T . trichiura or a combination , children co-infected with S . haematobium had a 3 . 1 ( [95%CI: 1 . 5\u20136 . 4] , p = 0 . 002 ) time odds of being infected with P . falciparum . This finding remained statistical significant when adjusted for age , sex , ascariasis and location ( aOR = 3 . 9 [95%CI: 1 . 75\u20139 . 19] , p < 0 . 001 ) . Age , sex and Ascaris infection were forced in the final model of the GLM analysis . During the 19 months follow-up phase for P . falciparum malaria incidence assessment , 210 ( 36% ) participants had developed a total of 318 new cases of malaria ( Table 6 ) . The overall incidence was 0 . 51 [95%CI: 0 . 47\u20130 . 55] per person-year . Taking into account the study groups , participants in the SI group had 1 . 4 [95%CI: 1 . 1\u20131 . 8] times the risk of developing malaria compared to their counterparts in the SU group . The time-to-first malaria episode was assessed for the first twelve months of follow-up of each participant and those who did not develop malaria before the end of that time were censored . Our results show that in the SI group , among the 101 ( 46% ) participants developed malaria , the median time to first malaria episode was 52 weeks . For their counterparts of SU group where 109 ( 30% ) participants developed malaria , the median time to first malaria episode was not reached at the end of 52 weeks of follow-up . As presented in Fig 2 , we found a significant delay to malaria in the SU group compared to SI group ( Log-Rank test: p = 0 . 00037 ) . Assessing the delay until development of malaria according to schistosomiasis status , we found that SI group participants had a 1 . 6 ( Cox model: p = 0 . 0004 ) times increased risk of early development of malaria as compared to their counterparts of the SU group . This association remains significant when adjusted for location , age and sex ( aRR = 1 . 9 , p = 0 . 000034 ) . Stratifying for age yielded a significant delay in time-to-first-malaria episode in the SU group ( median time not reach ) compared to the SI group , where the median time was 51 weeks ( p = 0 . 00003 ) for 6\u201310 year old children . Children with schistosomiasis had a 2 . 1 ( Mantel-Cox test: p = 0 . 00004 ) times increased risk of developing malaria compared to children without schistosomiasis . On the contrary , there was no difference in terms of delay in time-to-first malaria episode between the two study groups ( p = 0 . 41 ) in children aged 11\u201316 years . \n In area where schistosomiasis is endemic , the question of its effect on malaria outcome is a growing concern . Our study area is endemic for both infections [14] , and our study reveals that up to 11% of school-age children could be co-infected with P . falciparum and S . haematobium parasites , comparing to up to 15% of pregnant women co-infected in Cameroon [42] or 23% of children co-infected with S . mansoni in a co-endemic area of North-Western Tanzania [43] . In our study area , poly-parasitism is evident [8 , 9 , 13 , 14 , 24] . The prevalence of STH species ranged from 32% to 48% among children infected with S . haematobium . This finding is not surprising since STH is commonly reported to be prevalent in rural areas [43] . Therefore , the risk to be infected by multiple parasites including S . haematobium is high [44] . Since these intestinal parasites are known to be able to modulate the immune system of the host , it would be necessary to assess the effect of these infections on Schistosoma-P . falciparum association . Everything else equal , we found a trend of association between risk of P . falciparum carriage and Schistosoma infection . In univariate analysis , Adedoja et al . found that children infected with S . heamatobium have equal chances of being infected with P . falciparum as children with no worm infection [45] , while Ateba and collaborators found a significant increase of plasmodium asexual parasite prevalence among Schistosoma infected children in comparison to the uninfected [9] . Conflicting results found in the literature on schistosomiasis-malaria co-infection issue suggest that there are potential confounding factors not yet established which need to be taken into account . In this study , we found an effect-measure modification of Trichuris and Hookworm infections on the association between S . haematobium and P . falciparum . As well , location was identified as confounding factor . Some authors have previously shown that T . trichiura [18] and hookworm [45 , 46] individually can affect the association between schistosomiasis and malaria co-infection by increasing the risk of being infected with P . falciparum parasites . Our analysis was stratified for those two STH infections and adjusted for age and sex which could affect malaria infection [47] , and for location found in our analysis as confounding factor . The result shows that when considered only schistosomiasis infection , there is a trend on the risk of being infected with P . falciparum . But , in combination with trichuriasis or hookworm infection , schistosomiasis clearly increases the risk of being infected with P . falciparum . This result shows that S . haematobium alone does not predispose to P . falciparum infection in children instead of combined effect . We hypothesize that the cumulative effects of Schistosoma , Trichuris and Hookworm infections on P . falciparum parasite carriage acts at the immunological level . A potential immuno-modulation effect of a poly-parasitism not measured in our study could explain the combined effect of helminths we have observed . Indeed , there is evidence that Schistosoma infection can modulate the immune system in response to P . falciparum [9 , 11] . There is also evidence that T . trichiura can exert an influence on the immune response , and for instance negatively affect the antibody response to malaria vaccine candidate in children [17] . However , these potential cumulative effects of helminth infections on plasmodium infection need to be properly investigated at immunological level . The overall incidence of malaria was 0 . 51 per person-year . This incidence was higher among people infected with S . haematobium compared to the uninfected , suggesting that schistosomiasis infection increases the risk of developing malaria . Children infected with S . haematobium infection had 1 . 4 times the risk of developing malaria than uninfected . Regarding time-to-first malaria infection , we found that malaria occurred earlier in participants infected with Schistosoma than those uninfected even after adjustment for age , sex and location . The main symptom we have considered to define malaria was fever , which is one of the results of some endogenous pyrogen molecules activities , notably pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-\u03b1 during the infection . Some authors reported that during malaria infection , the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines as well as of anti-inflammatory cytokines can be affected by co-infection with schistosomiasis infection in an age-dependent manner [11 , 48] . In our study population , the assessment of the delay-to-malaria in relation to age group shows that there is no difference in terms of delay in time-to-first malaria in children aged from 11 to 16 years , while the difference was significant in children from 6 to 10 years . Children aged from 6 to 10 years infected with S . haematobium developed malaria earlier than those without S . haematobium infection . This finding could support the possible effect of age on the immune responses of malaria in co-infected subjects . However , since the finding is based on statistical significance , biological assessment is suitable for confirmation . We can retain that exposure to schistosomiasis enhances incidence of , and susceptibility to develop malaria in our study population . This finding corroborates with previous reports like the one by Sokhna and collaborators who reported an increased in susceptibility to developing malaria in co-infected children , even though it was only in children excreting high S . mansoni eggs loads [28]; supporting therefore the hypothesis that schistosomiasis negatively affects the outcome of malaria . This stands in opposition to the idea that schistosomiasis possibly improves the outcome of malaria . Indeed , it was reported , for instance , that protection from malaria is conferred by asymptomatic P . falciparum infection or co-infection with S . haematobium in a Malian study cohort [15] . In the study presented here , we assessed the effect of having been S . haematobium-infected on malaria instead of becoming infected at time of malaria , which could affect our conclusion compared to the studies mentioned above . On the other hand , it has been shown that STH can affect susceptibility to malaria infection by acting at the immunological level [49 , 50] . Not having considered the STH status of participants in our analysis could have affected our results; however , since all participants were assessed and infected ones were treated for STH at inclusion , we assume that the effect of STH was minimized . The prevalence of STH was similar between the both study groups at baseline , and the STH treatment effect was considered as equally distributed between groups . We have assessed the effect of schistosomiasis on clinical and parasitological aspects of P . falciparum infection based on prevalence of P . falciparum parasite carriage and malaria incidence . We therefore grouped our study population in relation to the schistosomiasis status . If it was easy at baseline to discriminate children infected or non-infected with S . haematobium , the problem we faced during the follow-up phase was to appropriately group our population in accordance with schistosomiasis status . Subjects infected at baseline or during the follow-up phase were treated systematically . However , they were considered as Schistosoma-infected for the whole follow-up phase and those who were not found positive throughout the survey were considered as non-infected . This approach was sustained by the fact that schistosomiasis is known as a chronic infection and , in areas where schistosomiasis is prevalent , the risk factors as playing habits , swimming , taking baths , washing clothes , distance from river are usually constant [51 , 52] and therefore the probability to be re-infected after treatment is high [53] . Thus , we have assessed the effect of schistosomiasis infection on P . falciparum parasite carriage at baseline and on malaria infection during the follow-up study phase . An earlier conducted study in the same population showed that PCR has a better sensitivity than microscopy for the detection of P . falciparum parasites [9] . We have used the light microscopy Lambar\u00e9n\u00e9 method for the detection of P . falciparum parasites as it is the clinical gold standard . However , this may lead to potential misclassification of the participants regarding P . falciparum status at baseline . We think that if prevalence of P . falciparum carriage could be underestimated , this potential misclassification of participants would have been equally distributed in both groups and would not therefore affect the trend of our results . This study confirms that the transmission of schistosomiasis is not evenly distributed in the vicinity of Lambar\u00e9n\u00e9 . Schistosomiasis infection is present in many villages but the prevalence varies significantly from one point to another . For example , we found a moderate prevalence for Bindo and Makouk\u00e9 villages where 19% of our study participants were found to be positive when compared to Zil\u00e9-PK villages , where 45% of our study participants were found to be positive . This corroborates with a previous pilot study conducted in the same population in 2012 . The earlier-indicated prevalences of 15% and 43% for Bindo and Zil\u00e9-PK villages , respectively [14] , suggest that prevalence of schistosomiasis infection is stable on each location . It was suggested that the difference observed could be explained by the fact that in Zil\u00e9-PK villages , streams represent the first source of water compared to Bindo village . The same observation could be applied to Makouk\u00e9 village where piped water is available for the majority of the population . Indeed , the lack of pipe water supply observed in the PK area promotes daily open freshwater contact by the population for household activities , bathing and playing , using the streams well known as schistosomiasis foci . In addition to humans , other ecological factors influence Schistosoma host snail density [54] , which affect schistosomiasis prevalence . Therefore , we can assume that such factors may also sustain the difference of prevalence for schistosomiasis observed between the both locations , which requires further research . On the other hand , we have observed that areas where S . haematobium prevalence is high , a high prevalence of P . falciparum carriage was also found . Indeed , the difference in prevalence observed in favour of the PK area for S . haematobium infection was also observed for P . falciparum . This observation suggest a correlation of factors affecting both infections as either a consequence of the presence of same environmental risk factors . Another explanation could be indeed the effect of S . haematobium infection on P . falciparum infection , as demonstrated above . However , this need to be more investigated . In summary , this study demonstrates that S . haematobium infection alone does not increase the risk of being infected with P . falciparum parasite but when associated with STH particularly with T . trichiura and hookworm , the risk does increase . On the other hand , in people exposed to schistosomiasis infection , risk and susceptibility of developing a malaria event increase in an age-dependent manner . Our results suggest that Schistosoma and probably STH co-infections in general cumulatively impact on malaria outcome in school-age children and therefore need to be accounted for when designing malaria control programs . Thus , in areas of co-endemicity and in support of higher efficiency , STH and schistosomiasis control should be considered as an additional tool of malaria control .", "headings": ["Abstract", "Introduction", "Methods", "Results", "Discussion"], "keywords": ["schistosoma", "invertebrates", "medicine and health sciences", "parasite groups", "plasmodium", "helminths", "tropical diseases", "hookworms", "parasitic diseases", "animals", "parasitic protozoans", "parasitology", "apicomplexa", "protozoans", "neglected tropical diseases", "malarial parasites", "schistosoma haematobium", "helminth infections", "schistosomiasis", "eukaryota", "biology and life sciences", "malaria", "organisms"], "id": "journal.pntd.0006663"}

However , immunosuppressive responses are sometimes generated in excess . This event often results in the strong inhibition of protective pro-inflammatory responses and leads to susceptibility to infectious pathogens , such as Plasmodium [1 , 2] , Leishmania [3 , 4] , lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus [5 , 6] , and Mycobacteria spp . [7] . Visceral leishmaniasis ( VL ) is a good example of dysregulated balance between inflammatory and anti-inflammatory responses . VL is a potentially lethal disease caused by Leishmania donovani and L . infantum/chagasi . Leishmania are protozoan parasites , existing as flagellated promastigotes within sandflies and as intracellular amastigotes in infected mammals . In the host , Leishmania preferentially infects macrophages; however , it can also be found in other cells , such as DCs , neutrophils , and fibroblasts [8\u201312] . VL is characterized by persistent infection of the spleen and by immunodeficiency during the chronic stage [13] . Experimental infection with L . donovani results in pathogen-induced disruption of the splenic microarchitecture , which involves both the disruption of the marginal zone and the B-cell follicles , and the progressive loss of stromal cells [14 , 15] . This disruption is mediated by TNF [16] , a cytokine that is overexpressed during VL [17 , 18] . Interestingly , TNF deficient mice infected with L . donovani have a lower IL-10 mRNA accumulation in the spleen than do their wild type counterparts [14] , suggesting that TNF may be involved as a positive regulator of IL-10 production . We have recently demonstrated that the inflammatory response following L . donovani infection is largely mediated by the transcription factor IRF-5 [19] . IRF-5 can be activated by TLR7 and TLR9 via the MyD88 signaling pathway and/or directly by viral infections and Type I interferon [20] . This transcription factor is responsible for the activation of genes encoding for various key inflammatory cytokines [21\u201324] . Interestingly , L . donovani infected Irf5-/- mice do not show the hallmark symptoms of VL , which are hepato-and splenomegaly , due to the lack of inflammatory cell infiltration . Furthermore , these mice generate profoundly defective Th1 responses during chronic disease [19] . The role of IRF-5-mediated inflammation on the development of CD8+ T cell responses during VL has not yet been explored . We have previously shown that L . donovani induces defective CD8+ T cell responses with limited clonal expansion [25] . Moreover , the majority of CD8+ T cells that survive clonal contraction are central memory-like cells , suggesting that perhaps effector responses are not sustained . Pro-inflammatory cytokines are known to tune CD8+ T cell responses and provide the critical third signal necessary for the development of effector CD8+ T cells [26\u201330] . For instance , IL-12 seems to regulate T-bet and eomesodermin ( Eomes ) expression [30 , 31] , the differentiation of short-lived effector cells ( SLEC ) [30] , and the cytolytic activity of CTLs [32] . Type I IFN , IFN\u03b3 , and IL-4 also appear to be required for efficient CD8+ T cells priming and memory differentiation [33\u201338] . The inflammatory milieu was also shown to control antigen sensitivity by enhancing T cell receptor signaling [39] . In contrast , Stelekati et al . recently reported that a bystander chronic inflammatory milieu impairs the development of CD8+ T cell memory following immunization [40] . This implies that inflammation does not always play a positive role in supporting the development of CD8+ T cell responses and that the role of inflammation might depend on the specific inflammatory milieu induced by each pathogen . In this study , we investigated the role of IRF-5 mediated inflammation in regulating CD8+ T cell expansion following L . donovani infection . Our data shows that IRF-5 participates in limiting antigen-specific CD8+ T cell expansion at the very early stages of infection by indirectly inducing HIF-1\u03b1 expression in DCs . Upregulation of HIF-1\u03b1 in DCs resulted in decreased IL-12 and increased IL-10 expression . Ablation of HIF-1\u03b1 in CD11c+ cells led to a higher frequency of short-lived effector CD8+ T cells ( SLEC ) , enhanced CD8+ T cell expansion , and significantly reduced parasite burden . \n We have previously demonstrated that IRF-5 is essential for initiating the inflammatory response following experimental L . donovani infection . Indeed , Irf5-/- mice fail to generate mature granulomas in the liver and exhibit a severely reduced inflammatory infiltration in the liver and spleen [19] . Hence , to investigate the role of inflammation in the development of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells , we monitored CD8+ T cell responses in L . donovani infected IRF-5-deficient mice . To this end , we adoptively transferred CD45 . 1-OT-I CD8+ T cells into Irf5flox/flox-CMV-Cre- and Irf5flox/flox-CMV-Cre+ mice . Mice were subsequently infected with ovalbumin-transgenic L . donovani amastigotes . We have previously reported that OT-I CD8+ T cells undergo clonal expansion between day 3 and 7 after parasite inoculation; by day 14 , about 80% of the cells display a central memory-like phenotype [25] . To our surprise , we observed a 3\u20134 fold increase in the number ( Fig 1A ) and frequency ( Fig 1B ) of OT-I CD8+ T cells present in the spleen of IRF-5-deficient mice at d7p . i . ; no difference was detected at d14p . i . We next analysed the phenotype of OT-I CD8+ T cells found in the spleen at d7 and 14p . i . Despite the fact that about 35% of OT-I CD8+ T cells had downregulated CD127 ( Fig 1C and S1 Fig ) , only 7% of the OT-I cells were CD127-KLRG1+ in the Cre- group ( Fig 1D and S1 Fig ) , suggesting that only a small percentage of the cells were short-lived effector cells ( SLEC ) . In contrast , a significant increase in frequency of CD127- ( Fig 1C and S1 Fig ) cells and SLEC ( Fig 1D and S1 Fig ) was noticed in IRF-5-deficient mice at d7 p . i . Because Leishmania is known to induce strong IL-6 and TNF responses [17 , 18] and IRF-5 is known to govern the expression of both cytokines [21\u201324] , we next assessed the mRNA levels for IL-6 and TNF in the spleen of L . donovani infected mice . As expected , IRF-5-deficient mice had a lower expression of IL-6 during the first week of infection ( Fig 1E ) . By d14 p . i . , however , both experimental groups expressed similar mRNA levels . In contrast , TNF mRNA levels were higher in Cre- mice compared to IRF-5 deficient mice during the first 2 weeks of infection ( Fig 1F ) . Taken together , our data suggest that IRF-5 participates in limiting CD8+ T cell expansion and hampering the development of SLEC . Because inflammation is known to induce HIF-1\u03b1 , we next proceeded to assess HIF-1\u03b1 expression in splenocytes from L . donovani infected mice . The hypoxia-inducible transcription factor ( HIF-1\u03b1 ) is the key regulator in the cellular response to hypoxia [41 , 42] . Under hypoxic conditions HIF-1\u03b1 accumulates and translocates into the nucleus , where it binds the constitutively expressed HIF-1\u03b2 [43] . The resultant heterodimer binds and triggers transcription of the hypoxia response element-containing genes in all cells [44] . Nevertheless , accumulation and transcriptional activity of HIF-1\u03b1 can also be induced at normoxic conditions by pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF and IL-1\u03b2 [45 , 46] , or by TLR ligation [47\u201349] . Furthermore , Leishmania promastigotes were reported to induce HIF-1\u03b1 in macrophages [50\u201352] . Hence , we first investigated whether HIF-1\u03b1 expression was at all upregulated in splenocytes following the inoculation of L . donovani amastigotes . As expected , HIF-1\u03b1 mRNA expression was upregulated in the spleen of L . donovani infected mice ( Fig 2A ) . HIF-1\u03b1 upregulation was confirmed on the protein level by western blot ( Fig 2B ) . We next determined if the upregulation of HIF-1\u03b1 in splenocytes had a negative effect on CD8+ T cell expansion and function . Thus , we generated hemizygous Hif1a+/- mice by crossing Hif1aflox/flox with CMV-Cre mice . We then monitored adoptively transferred CD45 . 1-OT-I CD8+ T cells at day 7 and 14 p . i . in L . donovani infected Hif1a+/- and Hif1aflox/flox mice . Interestingly , we observed a significant increase in the number ( Fig 2C ) as well as frequency ( Fig 2D ) of OT-I CD8+ T cells at day 7 p . i . in Hif1a+/- compared to the control group; at d14 p . i . , however , both groups had similar number and frequency of OT-I CD8+ T cells in the spleen . As previously seen in IRF-5-deficient mice , increased expansion was paralleled by a higher frequency of effector cells ( Fig 2E and S2 Fig ) . We also notice a significant decrease in the frequency of CD44hiCD62LhiCD127+ cells in Hif1a+/- mice compared to the control group ( Fig 2F and S2 Fig ) . Collectively , our results suggest that HIF-1\u03b1 might be involved in limiting CD8+ T cell expansion and effector cell differentiation . Enhanced CD8+ T cell responses were only observed at peak expansion in Hif1a+/- mice . Hence , it is possible that this transcription factor exerts different functions among various cell types . Since dendritic cells play a crucial role during T cell priming , we next assessed the effect of HIF-1\u03b1 expression in these cells . First , we wanted to determine if HIF-1\u03b1 was at all upregulated in dendritic cells during L . donovani infection . As shown in Fig 3A , HIF-1\u03b1 was progressively expressed in DCs during the first week of infection . Increased expression was also confirmed on the protein level by western blot ( Fig 3B ) . To determine whether IRF-5-mediated inflammation was at all involved in HIF-1\u03b1 upregulation in DCs , we next assessed HIF-1\u03b1 mRNA levels in DCs from IRF-5 deficient mice following L . donovani infection . Interestingly , HIF-1\u03b1 expression was only upregulated in DCs purified from infected IRF-5-sufficent mice , but not in those purified from IRF-5 deficient mice ( Fig 3C and 3D ) , suggesting that IRF-5 is involved in the induction of HIF-1\u03b1 in DCs . Similar results were obtained when HIF-1\u03b1 expression was assessed in CD11c- splenocytes ( Fig 3E ) . HIF-1\u03b1 was not directly induced by IRF-5 in DCs , since we could observe an increase in mRNA levels for HIF-1\u03b1 in IRF-5 deficient bone marrow derived DCs infected with L . donovani in vitro ( Fig 3F ) . This implies that IRF-5 is not required for the induction of HIF-1\u03b1 when DCs are directly infected by the parasite . Because only a very small percentage of splenic DCs bury parasites during acute infection ( S3 Fig ) , accumulation of HIF-1\u03b1 mRNA in DCs is most likely due to the inflammatory milieu induced by IRF5 . HIF-1\u03b1 upregulation in DCs was shown to reduce their stimulatory capacity for T cell functions in vitro [53] . To investigate the role of HIF-1 \u03b1 expression in DCs during experimental VL , we generated HIF-1\u03b1 conditional knock-out mice by crossing Hif1aflox/flox with Cd11c-Cre mice . Firstly , we assessed whether HIF-1\u03b1 expression was abolished in our conditional knock-outs . As shown in S4A Fig , HIF-1\u03b1 mRNA levels did not increase in L . donovani infected BMDC from Hif1aflox/flox\u2014Cd11c-Cre+ mice compared to the Cre- group as measured by real time PCR . Similar results were obtained with CD11c+ cells purified from the spleen following in vivo infection with L . donovani ( S4B Fig ) . It has been reported that Leishmania promastigotes require HIF-1\u03b1 for their survival inside macrophages and DCs [50 , 51] . Thus , we next evaluated whether this transcription factor was also needed for survival inside DCs by the intracellular and clinically relevant form of the parasite , namely the amastigote . In contrast to promastigotes , amastigotes seemed to survive equally well in BMDC from Hif1aflox/flox\u2014Cd11c-Cre+ mice compared to those derived from the Cre- group ( Fig 4A ) . We also assessed amastigote survival in purified splenic CD11chi DCs and found no differences at any time point between the two groups of mice ( Fig 4B ) . This suggests that amastigotes were able to survive inside DCs from Hif1aflox/flox\u2014Cd11c-Cre+ mice . We next proceeded to assess CD8+ T cell responses in our conditional knock-out mice . CD45 . 1-OT-I CD8+ T cells were adoptively transferred into Hif1aflox/flox\u2014Cd11c-Cre+ mice and their Cre- littermates a day prior to infection with L . donovani amastigotes . CD8+ T cell responses were then monitored at d7 ( peak expansion ) and 14 p . i . ( end of contraction ) . Remarkably , OT-I CD8+ T cells underwent a greater expansion in Hif1aflox/flox\u2014Cd11c-Cre+ mice compared to their Cre- littermates as indicated by a larger number and higher frequency of cells present in the spleen at d7 p . i . ( Fig 4C and 4D , left panels ) . Unlike in IRF-5 deficient and Hif+/- mice , this difference was still observed at d14 p . i . , when OT-I CD8+ T cell numbers were 3\u20134 fold higher in the conditional knock-out group ( Fig 4C and 4D , right panels ) . When we analyzed the phenotype of the adoptively transferred cells , we noticed a significant decrease in CD44hiCD62LhiCD127+ OT-I CD8+ T cells in Hif1aflox/flox\u2014Cd11c-Cre+ mice compared to littermate controls at both time points analyzed ( Fig 5A and S5 Fig ) , suggesting that less memory precursor effector cells ( MPEC ) were generated in those mice . These results were paralleled by an increase in effector cell frequency at d7 and 14 p . i . ( Fig 5B and S5 Fig ) , which was reflected in a higher percentage of CD127-KLRG1+ cells ( Fig 5C and S5 Fig ) in Hif1aflox/flox\u2014Cd11c-Cre+ . The T-box transcription factors Eomes and T-bet appear to regulate effector/memory differentiation program of CD8+ T cells . Because we observed an increase in frequency of SLEC , we were wondering whether Eomes and T-bet were expressed at different level in OT-I CD8+ T cells adoptively transferred into Hif1aflox/flox\u2014Cd11c-Cre+ mice compared to their Cre- counterpart . As expected , we noticed a significant decrease in Eomes in Hif1aflox/flox\u2014Cd11c-Cre+ mice at d7 p . i . compared to the HIF-1\u03b1 sufficient group ( Fig 5D and 5E ) . No differences , however , were observed at d14 . A light upregulation of T-bet was also observed in OT-I CD8+ T cells from the Cre+ group compared to the Cre- littermates , but this was not statistically significant ( Fig 5F and 5G ) . Interestingly , OT-I CD8+ T cells also showed a higher cytotoxic capacity in Hif1aflox/flox\u2014Cd11c-Cre+ mice compared to the control group ( Fig 5H and S5C Fig ) , while maintaining similar levels of IFN\u03b3 , TNF , and IL-2 production upon restimulation in vitro . Taken together , our data suggest that HIF-1\u03b1 expression in CD11c+ cells favours the development of MPEC and limits CD8+ T cell expansion following L . donovani infection . IL-12 plays an important role in promoting CD8+ T cell responses . Particularly , this cytokine has been shown to induce the development of SLEC by regulating T-bet expression [30 , 31] . In VL , IL-12 is mainly produced by DCs , however this production is not sustained after 24h [17] . Because more SLEC with a greater cytotoxic capacity were observed in Hif1aflox/flox\u2014Cd11c-Cre+ mice , we were wondering whether HIF-1\u03b1 deficient DCs were producing more IL-12 . Hence , we purified CD11chi splenic DCs from L . donovani infected mice at various time points after infection and assessed the expression of IL-12p35 by real time PCR . As shown in Fig 6A , IL-12p35 expression was sustained in Hif1aflox/flox\u2014Cd11c-Cre+ mice compared to the Cre- control group . Similar results were obtained when we measured IL-12p40 mRNA levels ( Fig 6B ) . We also assessed the expression of IL-10 , a cytokine that is known to be associated with susceptibility to experimental VL . IL-10 mRNA accumulation is readily detected in DCs few days after L . donovani inoculation and is continuously produced until the chronic phase of the disease [54] . In agreement with the literature , we noticed an increase in IL-10 mRNA levels in the Cre- group during the first 2 weeks of infection ( Fig 6C ) . In contrast , DCs from Hif1aflox/flox\u2014Cd11c-Cre+ mice failed to upregulate IL-10 expression during the first week of infection . At d14 p . i . , however , IL-10 mRNA levels in the Cre- group increased but were still significantly lower than the control group . No differences were observed between both groups in the IL-10 mRNA levels of the CD11c negative fraction . Interestingly , CD11chi splenic DCs lacking HIF-1\u03b1 also expressed lower TNF mRNA levels compared to their HIF-1\u03b1-sufficient counterparts ( Fig 6D ) ; similarly to IL-10 , TNF mRNA levels of the CD11c negative fraction were comparable in both groups between d5 and 14 p . i . ( S6 Fig ) . Finally , we wanted to determine whether HIF-1\u03b1 ablation in DCs had any biological effect on the course of L . donovani infection . Hence , we assessed the splenic parasite burden at various time points after infection ( Fig 7A ) . We noticed a significant reduction in the splenic parasite burden in Hif1aflox/flox\u2014Cd11c-Cre+ mice compared to the Cre- littermates already at d14p . i . Reduction in the parasite number in Hif1aflox/flox\u2014Cd11c-Cre+ mice at d14p . i was also confirmed by limiting dilutions ( Fig 7B ) . Interestingly , the hepatic parasite burden in Hif1aflox/flox\u2014Cd11c-Cre+ mice was not different than their Cre- counterpart ( Fig 7C ) . Finally , we proceeded to determine whether CD8+ T cells participate at all to the reduction in parasite numbers observed in the HIF-1\u03b1 conditional knock-out group . Hence , we depleted CD8+ T cells in L . donovani infected Hif1aflox/flox\u2014Cd11c-Cre+ and Cre- mice , and assessed the parasite burden at d14 p . i . As shown in Fig 7D , CD8+ T cell depletion only caused a mild and not significant increase in the parasite burden in Cre- mice; in contrast , CD8+ T cells seem to play an essential role in controlling parasite growth in HIF-1\u03b1 conditional knockout mice , suggesting that HIF-1\u03b1 induction in DCs is responsible for limiting protective CD8+ T cell responses . In conclusion , HIF-1\u03b1 induction in DCs represents an immune-evasive mechanism adopted by Leishmania to establish chronic infection . \n The natural reaction of an organism to a foreign pathogen is to initiate an inflammatory response . This response is essential for effective immunity against the pathogen . In the present study though , we show that the IRF-5-dependent inflammatory milieu induced by Leishmania during the first week of infection inhibits CD8+ T cell expansion and the development of SLECs by inducing HIF-1\u03b1 in dendritic cells and consequently altering DC functions . Ablation of HIF-1\u03b1 in CD11c+ cells resulted in a lower parasite burden . Following infection , antigen-specific CD8+ T cells expand and acquire effector function necessary for protective immunity . This process is initiated and sustained by inflammatory cytokines which play a major role during the development of CD8+ T cell responses by providing \u201csignal 3\u201d . Indeed , inflammatory cytokines were reported to tune effector/memory differentiation , expansion , and survival of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells [26\u201330 , 55] . IL-12 , for instance , is crucial for effector function acquisition following infection with Listeria monocytogenes [55] , vaccinia virus [56] , and Toxoplasma gondii [57] . IL-12 was also shown to participate in the induction of T-bet while repressing Eomes [30 , 31 , 58] . In contrast , IL-12 deficiency does not seem to interfere with CD8+ T cell development following LCMV infection , where type I IFN play the most critical role [36 , 37] . Hence , it appears that inflammatory cytokines promote and maintain CD8+ T cell differentiation to effectors while preventing the development of memory cells . It is important to note that most of the work on the role of inflammation in promoting CD8+ T cells was done in models of acute infection . A recent work showed that a chronic inflammatory environment negatively impacted the development of CD8+ T cell responses [40] , suggesting that perhaps the composition of the inflammatory milieu rather than inflammation itself determines the outcome of CD8+ T cell responses . It is thus crucial to identify the pathogen-specific signature of proinflammatory cytokines to determine the effect of inflammation on CD8+ T cell responses . Our data suggest that IRF-5-mediate inflammation induced by Leishmania at early stages of infection plays a detrimental role in the development of protective CD8+ T cell responses . IRF-5 is involved in the transcriptional activation of both Type I IFN genes and genes encoding for key pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-12 , TNF , IL-23 and IL-6 [21 , 22 , 24 , 59] . Our recent study using Irf5-/- mice indicates that IRF-5 is essential for the development of protective Th1 responses . In fact , L . donovani infected Irf5-/- mice generate profoundly defective Th1 cells during chronic disease . However , we observed stronger Th1 responses in Irf5-/- mice during the first two weeks of infection , suggesting that priming of Th1 cells was more effective in the absence of IRF-5 and that IRF-5 is mainly needed for sustaining Th1 responses [19] . These observations prompted us to think that the strong TNF-dominated inflammatory response induced by Leishmania at the onset of infection [18] [60] plays a dual role and may help the establishment of chronic infection by inhibiting T cell responses . To control the inflammatory response launched by foreign pathogens upon encounter with the immune system , the host has evolved several defense mechanisms aimed at tissue protection . One of these mechanisms is the hypoxia-driven , adenosine receptor-mediated immune suppressive pathway . The hypoxia-adenosinergic tissue-protecting pathway is a physiologic response to inflammatory damage , low oxygen tension , and hypoxia-driven accumulation of extracellular adenosine . HIF-1\u03b1 is the key regulator in the cellular response to hypoxia [41] . This pathway is designed to allow the cells to survive in an environment of low oxygen tension , but it also leads to suppression of pro-inflammatory responses [61\u201364] . Indeed , HIF-1\u03b1 suppresses cytokine production in T-cells [64\u201366] , induces the potency and the number of CD25+CD4+ regulatory T-cells [67] , induces IL-10 production [68 , 69] , and inhibits DC maturation [53] . Moreover , HIF-1\u03b1 expression in tumor-associated macrophages enhances the T cell suppressive capacity of these cells [70 , 71]; HIF-1\u03b1 also causes upregulation of PD-L1 on MDSC , exacerbating their suppressive capacity [72 , 73] . Under normoxic conditions , HIF-1\u03b1 can be upregulated by inflammatory cytokines such as TNF and IL-1\u03b2 , by TLR agonists , and by several viruses [74 , 75] , bacteria [75 , 76] , and parasites [51 , 75 , 77 , 78] . Leishmania promastigotes are known to stabilize HIF-1\u03b1 and induce HIF-1\u03b1 mRNA in host cells [51 , 52] . Our results indicate that L . donovani amastigotes are also able to induce HIF-1\u03b1 mRNA in BMDC; however , unlike for promastigotes [51] , HIF-1\u03b1 was not required for amastigote survival inside DCs . Interestingly , HIF-1\u03b1 mRNA was induced in dendritic cells following L . donovani infection in an IRF-5-dependent manner . Because HIF-1\u03b1 mRNA levels in IRF-5 deficient BMDC infected with L . donovani amastigotes were comparable to those observed in infected IRF-5 sufficient BMDC , we assume that HIF-1\u03b1 in DCs is mainly induced by the inflammatory milieu generated by IRF-5 rather than the parasite itself . This suggests that IRF-5 is not involved in the induction of HIF-1\u03b1 in DCs upon direct infection with L . donovani . The factor ( s ) responsible for the induction of HIF-1\u03b1 in DCs following infection with L . donovani amastigotes are yet unknown . We tried to block IL-6R and TNF , but this blockade did not affect HIF-1\u03b1 expression or CD8+ T cell expansion , suggesting that the upregulation of HIF-1\u03b1 in DCs does not rely on the effect of a single cytokine . Further investigations are warranted in order to identify the mechanism ( s ) of HIF-1\u03b1 induction in DCs during experimental VL . HIF-1\u03b1 appears to play a dual role in myeloid cells . An important body of literature has demonstrated that HIF-1\u03b1 is involved in myeloid cell-mediated inflammation and is critical in the defence against various pathogens [76 , 79 , 80] . For instance , macrophages phagocytose and kill bacteria better under hypoxic conditions rather than under normoxic conditions [76 , 80] . Thus it is not surprising that mice with a targeted deletion of HIF-1\u03b1 in myeloid cells are more susceptible to many bacterial and viral pathogens [76 , 79 , 81] . In contrast , some pathogens such as Toxoplasma gondii and Leishmania ( promastigotes ) require HIF-1\u03b1 for their survival inside the cell [50\u201352 , 78] . This transcription factor was also shown to enhance replication of some viruses [82\u201384] . In the tumor microenvironment , HIF-1\u03b1 expression in tumor-associated macrophages suppresses T cell responses [70] and induces expression of arginase 1 [71]; HIF-1\u03b1 also enhances the inhibitory effect of MDSC [72] . Divergent effects of HIF-1\u03b1 upregulation have also been observed in DCs . HIF-1\u03b1 appears to play an important role in DC differentiation and migration in a hypoxic environment [53 , 85] . Nevertheless , this transcription factor impairs the upregulation of CCR7 , a chemokine involved in homing of mature DCs to secondary lymphoid organs [53 , 85] . Moreover , HIF-1\u03b1 acts as a negative regulator of plasmacytoid dendritic cell development [86] . Our results reveal a detrimental role for HIF-1\u03b1 in DC function during experimental VL . Indeed , the absence of HIF-1\u03b1 in DCs resulted in increased CD8 T cell expansion and a higher frequency of SLECs . Increased expansion directly correlated with a lower splenic parasite burden in HIF-1\u03b1 conditional knock out mice . In contrast , the parasite load in the liver remained unchanged . This is possibly due to the differences in the cellular environment between liver and spleen , and also to the type of cell that hosts the parasite at the onset of infection . The two organs generate very diverse immune responses that lead to parasite clearance in the liver and chronic infection in the spleen [13] . Interestingly , OT-I CD8+ T cells were still detectable at a higher frequency at d14 p . i . in Hifflox/flox- Cd11c-cre+ mice; in contrast in Hif+/-mice , the frequency at d14 p . i . was similar to the control group . This difference could possibly be caused by the general reduction in the level of IL-10 expression in infected Hif+/- mice compared to Hifflox/flox- Cd11c-cre+ mice . We have previously reported that IL-10 blockade induces increased expansion of CD8+ T cells [87] . However , in the absence of IL-10 , CD8+ T cells display a more dramatic contraction , at the end of which CD8+ T cell numbers are similar to those observed in infected wild type mice . This suggests that HIF-1\u03b1 expression in some cells is necessary to counterbalance the strong inflammatory responses induced by L . donovani and slow down clonal contraction . L . donovani typically induces a swift IL-12 production by DCs at very early stages of infection; this production , however , ceases after 24h of infection [17] . We observed a sustained IL-12p35 and IL12p40 expression in HIF-1\u03b1 deficient DCs . This expression was paralleled by a decrease in IL-10 and TNF mRNA levels . This suggests that HIF-1\u03b1 directly or indirectly regulates the expression of IL-12 , TNF , and IL-10 in dendritic cells . Increased expression of IL-12p35 and p40 may explain the higher frequency of SLECs detected in mice with a targeted deletion of HIF-1\u03b1 in CD11c+ cells and therefore the enhanced expansion . Identifying the mechanism of HIF-1\u03b1 induction in DCs will help to understand the physiological role of this transcription factor . It is possible that the pathway of activation as well as the duration of the signal determine the target gene selection and the final effect on DC functions . In conclusion , we demonstrate that IRF-5-mediated inflammation induced by L . donovani at the onset of the infection participates in limiting CD8+ T cell expansion by upregulating HIF-1\u03b1 in DCs and subsequently impairing DC functions . Several pathogens that cause chronic infections induce upregulation of HIF-1\u03b1 , which is then directly required for their survival . Our data additionally shows that HIF-1\u03b1 induction in DCs that are not the main target of Leishmania results in disease susceptibility . It is thus tempting to speculate that targeting the HIF-1\u03b1 pathway may represent a major immune evasive mechanism adopted by some pathogens to establish chronic infection . \n C57BL/6-Tg ( OT-I ) -RAG1tm1Mom mice and B6-Ly5 . 1 congenic mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory .

Wild type and ovalbumin transgenic Leishmania donovani ( strain LV9 ) were maintained by serial passage in B6 . 129S7-Rag1tm1Mom mice , and amastigotes were isolated from the spleens of infected animals . Mice were infected by injecting 2\u00d7107 amastigotes intravenously via the lateral tail vein . Splenic parasite burdens were determined either by limiting dilutions or by examining methanol-fixed , Giemsa stained tissue impression smears [87] . Data are presented as number of parasites per spleen or as Leishman Donovan Units ( LDU ) . Experiments involving mice were carried out under protocols approved by the Comit\u00e9 Institutionel de Protection des Animaux of the INRS-Institut Armand-Frappier ( 1110\u201306 , 1110\u201307 ) . These protocols respect procedures on good animal practice provided by the Canadian Council on animal care . CD45 . 1-OT-I/RAG1 mice , transgenic for a T cell receptor specific for chicken ovalbumin 257\u2013264 presented by the MHC class I molecule H-2 Kb , were used as T cell donors . CD8+ T cells were enriched from splenocytes of na\u00efve CD45 . 1-OT-I/RAG1 animals as previously described [25] . 2x104 CD45 . 1- OT-I CD8+ T cells were injected into the lateral tail vein of Irf5flox/flox CMV-Cre+ , Hif1a+/- , Hif1\u03b1flox/flox CD11c-Cre+ mice and their respective Cre- littermate controls . Animals were infected the day after with ovalbumin-transgenic Leishmania donovani amastigotes . L . donovani parasites were stained with PKH67 ( Sigma ) following manufacturer\u2019s instructions , as previously described [87] . Mice received 5 x 107 PKH67 labeled parasites . Spleens from na\u00efve and infected mice were harvested 24h later and surface stained for flow cytometric analysis . Adoptively transferred OT-I CD8+ T cells were identified by staining splenocytes with FITC-conjugated anti-CD45 . 1 antibody and Pacific Blue-conjugated anti-CD8 ( BD Biosciences ) . The following antibodies were used to further characterize the OT-I response: APC-conjugated anti-CD44 and anti-KLRG1 , PE-Cy5-conjugated anti-CD62L , and PE-conjugated anti-CD127 ( all obtained from eBioscience ) . For all surface markers , cells were directly stained as previously described [25] . For intracellular staining , splenocytes were stimulated with the SIINFEKL peptide for 4 hours in the presence of Brefeldin A and recombinant IL-2 , and then stained with FITC-conjugated anti-CD45 . 1 and Pacific Blue-conjugated anti-CD8 . After fixation , cells were permeabilized and stained with PE-conjugated anti-granzyme B ( Invitrogen ) , PE-conjugated anti-Eomes and anti-IL-2 ( BD Biosciences ) . APC-conjugated anti-INF\u03b3 and PE-Cy7-conjugated anti-TNF were also used . Flow cytometric analysis was performed with a BD LSRFortessa cell analyzer ( Becton Dickinson ) . One to two millions cells per sample were acquired and analyzed with the FACSDiva or with the Flowjo software . For DCs analysis after injection of PKH67-labelled parasites , spleens were removed 24h after parasite injection and digested with collagenase . Splenocytes were then stained with anti-CD11c-APC , anti-MHCII-PE , anti-CD8-PB , and anti-CD4-PE-Cy7 . Flow cytometric analysis was performed with a BD LSRFortessa cell analyzer ( Becton Dickinson ) . Real-time PCR ( Stratagene mx3005p Real time PCR System ) was used to analyze transcripts levels of HPRT , HIF-1\u03b1 , IL-10 , IL-12p35 , IL-12p40 , IL-6 , and TNF [19 , 54 , 88 , 89] . Total RNA was insolated using RNeasy ( Qiagen ) to perform real-time RT-PCR . cDNA was prepared using 500 ng of total RNA using High capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription kit ( Bio Rad ) . Real time PCR was performed using standard cycle of amplification . Total cell protein extracts of CD11c+ cells purified by MACS and cell sorting from infected and naive mice were pooled and lysed in RIPA buffer ( sigma Aldrich , Germany ) . Equal amounts of protein ( 15 \u03bcg ) were fractionated by 10% SDS-PAGE . Monoclonal anti-HIF-1\u03b1 antibody Hif-1\u03b167 ( Novus Biologicals , Littleton , CO , USA ) was used for immunoblot assays . Blots were stripped and reprobed with a polyclonal antibody against \u03b2-actin to confirm equal protein loading . [90] . Densitometric analysis was performed by spot densitometry using AlphaImager 3400 imaging software ( Alpha Innotech Corporation ) and normalized to \u00df-actin control . Values are presented as fold induction compared to the level in naive mice . CD11c+ dendritic cells ( DCs ) were isolated using anti-CD11c beads ( Miltenyi Biotec ) [19] . BMDC were generated as previously described [91] and seeded at 106 cells/ml onto 24-well plates . Cells were subsequently infected with PKH26-stained L . donovani amastigotes ( Sigma , staining done according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions ) at a MOI of 5:1 . Infected cells were then harvested 24 , 48 , and 72 h later , fixed with 2% PFA , stained with Hoechst ( Invitrogen , staining done according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions ) and cytospined on PBS/ 1% BSA-prepared slides . Mounted slides were than analyzed using a fluorescent microscope , to evaluate parasite survival and target infection rate . Hifflox/flox- Cd11c cre+ and cre- mice were treated bi-weekly with 0 . 2 mg of anti-CD8 antibody ( clone 2 . 43 ) , starting one day before infection . At day 14 p . i . , mice were sacrificed and parasite burdens were determined by limiting dilutions . Statistical analysis was performed using a Student\u2019s t-test , with p<0 . 05 considered significant . All experiments were conducted independently at least three times .", "headings": ["Abstract", "Introduction", "Results", "Discussion", "Materials and Methods"], "keywords": [], "id": "journal.ppat.1004938"}
{"lay_summary": "In contrast to other clinical presentations of leishmaniasis in Latin America , American visceral leishmaniasis ( VL ) can lead to death in 5-10% of patients under treatment . The fatality rates associated with this disease have remained stable at a high level over the years in Brazil and are neither recorded in under-treatment patients from endemic countries of the Old World nor from non-endemic countries where such cases are imported . Since VL-induced lethality can occur even after the implementation of recommended therapy , the understanding of individual , clinical and laboratory factors that predispose to an unfavorable outcome might represent an important feature for informing better practice in the clinical management of cases . The present systematic review with meta-analysis brings together information on various prognostic variables associated with the severity of VL . Potential predictors identified in the studies surveyed were grouped according to the strength of evidence available , and 13 were considered to be of significant relevance . The gaps in the existing knowledge and the need for the development of externally validated prognostic models were also discussed . The results presented herein could be useful in identifying patients at higher risk of unfavorable evolution or death from VL , and might provide an aid in decision-making regarding the clinical management of VL cases .", "article": "In the current context of high fatality rates associated with American visceral leishmaniasis ( VL ) , the appropriate use of prognostic factors to identify patients at higher risk of unfavorable outcomes represents a potential tool for clinical practice . This systematic review brings together information reported in studies conducted in Latin America , on the potential predictors of adverse prognosis ( continued evolution of the initial clinical conditions of the patient despite the implementation of treatment , independent of the occurrence of death ) and death from VL . The limitations of the existing knowledge , the advances achieved and the approaches to be used in future research are presented . The full texts of 14 studies conforming to the inclusion criteria were analyzed and their methodological quality examined by means of a tool developed in the light of current research tools . Information regarding prognostic variables was synthesized using meta-analysis . Variables were grouped according to the strength of evidence considering summary measures , patterns and heterogeneity of effect-sizes , and the results of multivariate analyses . The strongest predictors identified in this review were jaundice , thrombocytopenia , hemorrhage , HIV coinfection , diarrhea , age <5 and age >40\u201350 years , severe neutropenia , dyspnoea and bacterial infections . Edema and low hemoglobin concentration were also associated with unfavorable outcomes . The main limitation identified was the absence of validation procedures for the few prognostic models developed so far . Integration of the results from different investigations conducted over the last 10 years enabled the identification of consistent prognostic variables that could be useful in recognizing and handling VL patients at higher risk of unfavorable outcomes . The development of externally validated prognostic models must be prioritized in future investigations . \n Visceral leishmaniasis ( VL ) constitutes a serious public health problem in endemic regions , especially in the Indian sub-continent , in North and East Africa , and in South America . However , VL is one of the most neglected diseases in the world [1] , closely associated with poverty , for which effective and affordable chemotherapies remain scarce [2] , [3] . In Brazil , American VL was originally confined almost entirely to rural areas in the northeast of the country , but since the 1980s the disease has spread to large cities in the northeast , southeast and center-west regions of the country [4] . During the first decade of the 21st century , some 40 , 000 cases of VL and 2 , 500 VL-related deaths were reported in the country with no signs of a significant reduction in the fatality rates [5] , [6] . In the Americas , the transmission of VL to humans occurs through the bite of female phlebotomine sandflies of the genus Lutzomyia , which hosts the promastigote form of Leishmania infantum [7] . After a relatively long incubation period of 3 to 8 months , the disease manifests itself through signs and symptoms that include irregular or remittent fever , cough , tiredness , weakness , loss of appetite and weight , together with those caused by invasion of the parasite into the phagocytic system such as enlargement of lymph nodes , liver and spleen [8] . The evolution of VL varies from case to case , and some infected individuals may never exhibit any signs of the disease [9] , [10] . In cases of VL-related mortality , the outcome results predominantly from hemorrhage or co-infection [11] . Treatment options for VL in Brazil are pentavalent antimonial compounds and formulations of amphotericin B [12] . Although amphotericin B exhibits stronger antileishmanial activity than pentavalent antimonials , the treatment practice employed in Latin America is based on weak scientific evidence [4] and may induce parasite resistance [13] or be subject to host-related limitations associated with unresponsiveness , drug toxicity or prolonged parenteral administration [14] . The lack of reduction in the fatality rates of VL in Brazil can be explained not only by the limitations in therapy applied and the delay in diagnosis [12] , but also by the lack of adequate management provided to individuals at higher risk of an unfavorable evolution of the disease . In this context , the identification of prognostic factors associated with VL might be a valuable tool for clinical practice . Prognostic factors are defined as variables that predict the course of a disease , possible outcomes and the frequency with which they can be expected to occur . Knowledge about such factors is essential in medicine , prompting the selection of the most appropriate diagnostic tests and treatments to be applied , assisting in the development of new medical interventions , aiding in the monitoring of disease progression , and facilitating the counseling of patients regarding their future health condition [15]\u2013[17] . In the case of VL , prognostic indicators of disease severity could also be used to establish if treatment should be carried out in primary health care units or in specialized care centers , and would be of considerable value in prescribing specific interventions for patients at most risk of a lethal outcome [12] , [18] . Generally , prognostic factors have received less research attention than etiological factors and therapeutics [15] , [19] , although in some medical fields , particularly those related to oncology , several prognostic models have been published [20] , [21] . In Brazil , a number of studies have been performed with the purpose of identifying individual , clinical and laboratory factors associated with poor evolution of VL and/or lethal outcome [12] . However , to the best of our knowledge , no systematic review articles have been published summarizing the current state of understanding of VL prognostic factors and indicating the most consistent predictors . Considering the relevance of predictors of clinical evolution in reducing the number of VL-induced deaths , and the need for reliable prognostic models ( developed and validated according to appropriate methodologies ) , the present systematic review with meta-analysis seeks to bring together information reported in studies of the potential predictors of death and other adverse outcomes of American VL . In addition , based on the analysis of the limitations of the published studies and of existing knowledge we propose possible improvements that might be incorporated into future research . \n Independent literature searches were conducted between March and September 2011 by two of the authors ( VSB and DSB ) using the databanks and keywords listed in Fig . 1 . Additional studies were identified by contacting experts in the field and by searching reference lists within selected publications . The titles and abstracts of all articles identified in the searches were subjected to an initial evaluation , and the full texts of those considered potentially relevant by at least one of the authors were analyzed . The systematic review encompassed epidemiological studies containing data that allowed us to estimate measures of association relating to predictors of death or of adverse prognosis independent of the occurrence of death ( sets of signs and/or symptoms characterizing the continued evolution of the initial clinical conditions of the patient following the implementation of treatment ) in individuals diagnosed with VL . No restrictions were made regarding the age or gender of the patients or of the language of the publication . The exclusion criteria proposed were ( i ) studies performed outside Latin America; ( ii ) reports published as proceedings of symposiums or conferences; ( iii ) studies restricted to the description of signs and symptoms observed in VL-infected individuals without comparisons regarding the evolution of the disease; ( iv ) studies that simply described the existence of statistically significant ( or not ) associations without reporting at least the calculated P values or crude data that made possible the calculation of effect sizes ( provided such information had not been obtained directly from the authors ) ; ( v ) studies containing confusing text or incomprehensible analyses; ( vi ) studies exhibiting bias or inconsistencies that invalidated the results; and ( vii ) studies of prognostic factors related to genetic features or to quantification of cytokines . The extraction of data from the publications was performed by one of the authors ( VSB ) and verified by the co-authors . Attempts were made to contact the authors of original reports when further information was required in order to calculate measures of association for possible inclusion in the meta-analysis . Data pertaining to individual patients were not requested . The selected studies were separated into two main groups according to the outcomes , namely: ( i ) adverse evolution of the disease independent of death ( as defined in the last section ) , ( ii ) evolution of the disease resulting in death . The first group of studies encompassed various possible outcomes and the information concerning each of the clinical or laboratory predictors identified was , if considered plausible ( i . e . if the issue examined , the cut-off points and methods of analysis were not divergent ) , combined through meta-analysis of one sized P-values using the Stouffer method , weighted proportionally to the inverse of the study squared standard error [22] . In the second group , meta-analysis of measures of association were performed when cut-off points for defining variable categories employed in primary studies had close values . In this case , the effect-sizes adjusted by the greatest number of variables in each study were pooled regarding the odds ratio ( OR ) . However , when there was divergence regarding the cut-off points , or when the predictors were defined differently but were relatively similar , meta-analysis of P-values was carried out as for the first group . For both groups of studies , we conducted theoretical discussions about variables that could not be submitted to meta-analysis , either because of the small number of studies involved or because of the non-uniform manner in which the data were presented or analyzed among the primary studies . Measures of association were combined using the random effects model , except when the number of studies was less than four in which case the fixed effects model was employed [3] . The occurrence of heterogeneity in measures of effect between studies was analyzed using the I2 test , which describes the percentage of total variation across studies associated with real dispersion in effect-sizes ( inter-study variation ) rather than random error ( intra-study variation ) . For each prognostic factor , the studies were separated according to the ages of the participants ( adults and children ) and evaluations were performed separately for each group . When the measures of association were similar in the two groups the data were combined , otherwise the combination of data was performed only within the specific group . Meta-P software was employed for the meta-analysis of P-values , while CMA software version 2 . 0 . 057 was used for all other meta-analyses . The relative strength of each of the clinical and laboratory variables as a predictor of the severity of VL was evaluated according to defined criteria which were , in decreasing order of weight: ( i ) force of summary measure obtained through meta-analysis; ( ii ) pattern of data ( direction of association and heterogeneity in studies where the outcome was death ) ; ( iii ) number of statistically significant studies in which the control for confounding variables had been performed; and ( iv ) pattern of associations in studies where the outcome was unfavorable clinical evolution independent of death . There is no universally accepted or standardized tool for the identification of limitations or potential risks of bias in the analysis and/or presentation of data in studies relating to prognostic factors . Thus , in order to analyze the quality of studies reviewed we opted to use five publications [15] , [16] , [23]\u2013[25] describing principles and methods for the development of prognostic models . Additionally , the STROBE statement , the aim of which is to strengthen the reporting of observational studies in epidemiology , was used to complement these resources [26] . Based on these publications , a set of 17 conditions was established in order to evaluate the adequacy of the methodology employed and the clarity of presentation of the results described in the included studies ( Fig . 2 ) . \n Of the 2945 studies identified and screened as part of the comprehensive survey , only 14 prognostic studies [11] , [18] , [27]\u2013[38] complied fully with the inclusion criteria ( Fig . 3 ) . Although the survey covered studies conducted in all Latin America , the 14 selected publications originated from Brazil . Ten publications described death as the outcome of interest , while three referred to the clinical evolution of the patients independent of death , and one targeted both outcomes . The sources of information used in these studies were medical records ( 11/14 ) , direct interviews with the patients during hospitalization ( 2/14 ) and the Brazilian Information System on Disease Notification ( Sistema de Informa\u00e7\u00e3o de Agravos de Notifica\u00e7\u00e3o; SINAN; 1/14 ) as shown in Table S1 . Each of the 14 studies reviewed employed appropriate criteria for selecting the study populations and defining the cases , and all except one [36] observed fully the premises for the statistical analysis of the data . Only two studies [27] , [29] failed to employ any control for confounding factors and to describe the treatment adopted ( which was always based on the recommendations of Brazilian Ministry of Health [12] ) , although a number of studies presented limitations regarding the definitions of variables [27] , [31] , [33] , [36] , [37] , extraction of data from medical records [11] , [27] , [33] , [34] , [36] , [37] , selection of variables for the regression models [27] , [29] , [32] , [36] , [37] , and description of the results [11] , [27] , [33] , [36] , [37] . Eight articles failed to provide information regarding missing data in the medical records/SINAN or sample losses [11] , [27] , [29] , [30] , [34] , [36]\u2013[38] and three [18] , [32] , [35] of the six studies that described these aspects did not treat the matter in the correct manner . Only one study [32] employed adequate criteria for the stratification of continuous variables . The statistical power was generally low and the treatment of data and the description of the methods employed for the construction of models were poorly described in most articles . For example , testing of interaction effects was described in only one study [18] , while multicollinearity testing was fully described in just two studies [28] , [38] . Additionally , more than half of the studies ( 9/14 ) ignored completely calibration and discrimination procedures [27] , [29] , [31] , [33]\u2013[38] . None of the studies addressed the issue of validation of the predictive regression models in populations other than that of the original study ( Fig . 4 ) . All predictors of adverse evolution of VL and/or related mortality for which it was possible to perform meta-analysis ( Text S1 ) are presented and classified according to strength in Table S2 . Nine potentially strong predictors ( Groups I and II in Table S2 ) were identified , namely , jaundice , thrombocytopenia , hemorrhage , HIV coinfection , diarrhea , severe neutropenia , age <5 years , age >40\u201350 years , dyspnoea and bacterial infection . All but the last three factors mentioned above presented summary measures significantly associated with mortality , consistency of effects in the direction of adverse evolution and mortality , and statistical significance in the majority of the multivariate analyses . While age >40\u201350 years , dyspnoea and bacterial infection were also strong predictors of death , their strength with respect to adverse evolution could not be assessed owing to the lack of studies exploring this outcome independent of death . Apart from hepatomegaly , splenomegaly and weight loss , which were considered weak predictors , there was a predominance of statistically significant summary measures that showed , however , no significance in the majority of multivariate analyses ( Groups III\u2013V in Table S2 ) . Additionally , separate analyses of the variables in adults and children showed that there were no differences between the two groups except for the gender of participants and the interval between onset of symptoms and hospital admission , indicating that , in general , the predictors pointed in the same manner and direction independent of age group . Prognostic factors that could not be submitted to meta-analysis did not form part of the classification of evidence adopted in this review . For example , Costa [32] reported that inappetence , kidney failure and high levels of alkaline phosphatase were highly associated with the risk of death , while other studies [29] , [31] showed that VL-infected individuals with proteinuria had increased risk of unfavorable evolution and death . Moreover , Madalosso [33] demonstrated an association between mortality and positive myelogram , tuberculosis , dehydration , cardiovascular anomalies , asthenia , diabetes , splenectomy , myocardiopathy and abdominal pain . In addition , Costa et al . [31] demonstrated that VL-infected individuals with creatinine levels above 1 . 2 mg/100 mL exhibited high mortality risk , while Alvarenga et al . [27] showed that VL-infected individuals with comorbidities ( HIV infection , liver and kidney diseases , cardiopathy , and other non-defined problems ) had less chance of survival , similar to the findings of Araujo [28] for patients with other comorbidities ( weakness and tuberculosis ) . Finally , Cavalcante [30] reported that individuals who recovered from VL within 20 days of treatment presented a higher mean eosinophil count as compared with those that did not recover , while individuals whose outcome was death exhibited higher mean values of prothrombin time and erythrocyte sedimentation rate compared with those that recovered . On the other hand , Braga [29] and Souza [38] showed that there was no significant difference between individuals that recovered and those that did not recover within 20 days of treatment regarding the mean lymphocyte count as well as when some cut-off point was used for this parameter . \n The present systematic review identified , combined and analyzed information reported in studies addressing the factors associated with adverse prognosis of American VL and associated mortality . It was possible to identify a set of variables that ought to be considered in the clinical practice in order to improve disease management of patients and deserve further evaluation in future etiological and interventional studies in order to increase the empirical evidence on which to base their causal role . The occurrence of jaundice was the strongest risk factor for severity of VL , demonstrating the relevance of hepatic impairment in disease progression . The association between jaundice and blood clotting disorders suggests the existence of a common hepatic mechanism [32] , while liver dysfunctions in association with thrombocytopenia may lead to severe hemorrhage that could be responsible for the increased risk of death [39] . Considering that pentavalent antimonials , which represent the first-line of treatment of VL , are known to cause hepatotoxic side effects [40] , VL-diagnosed individuals with jaundice or altered liver disease markers should be treated with amphotericin B-based pharmaceuticals rather than with antimonials . Inexplicably , this approach is not always followed , as exemplified by the patients investigated by Alvarenga et al . [27] . Hemorrhage was also a strong prognostic factor for adverse evolution of VL , and complications arising from this condition were major causes of death . Thus , the detection of bleeding at the first diagnosis or during the course of treatment is crucial in the identification of severity . According to Costa [32] , hemorrhage is a consequence of the VL-induced inflammatory process , since pathogenesis of the disease is based on a cascade of events comprising activation of the inflammatory response , development of systemic endothelial lesions , activation of intravascular clotting , hypoperfusion , hypoxemia and , ultimately , cell death . Although the present review did not take into account the number of bleeding sites , it has been demonstrated that the greater the number of hemorrhagic points the higher is the risk of death [11] , [32] , suggesting that such relationship must be further investigated . Thrombocytopenia was the second most important predictor of VL-induced death , although it is not possible to state with certainty if this variable is a cause or a consequence of hemorrhage . Splenic sequestration of platelets is possibly the main cause of a low platelet count [41] , but this hypothesis only partially explains the disruption of homeostasis [32] , and it has been suggested that thrombocytopenia is directly associated with the systemic inflammation induced by disseminated intravascular clotting [42] . From the reviewed data , it would appear that counts lower than 100 , 000 platelets/mm3 are indicative of high risk of adverse evolution , although a cut-off point of 50 , 000 platelets/mm3 is associated with an even higher risk . Thus , rather than attempting to define a standard limit of thrombocytopenia , it is of greater importance to assess each case separately in order to decide which is the most appropriate hemotherapeutic approach . In this context , the manual issued by the Ministry of Health of Brazil [12] recommends platelet transfusion only for VL patients presenting counts lower than 10 , 000 platelets/mm3 . Leishmania-HIV coinfection was a relevant prognostic factor for the adverse evolution of VL , since all studies analyzed and all multivariate analyses performed showed that coinfected individuals had a higher risk of poor prognosis . Considering that HIV induces the replication of Leishmania , that Th1-type immune response changes into Th2-type in both VL and HIV infection , and that HIV as well as Leishmania infect and multiply within cells of myeloid or lymphoid origin , the damaging effects of HIV and VL on the cellular immune system are not only synergistic but also reciprocally modulate pathogenesis [43]\u2013[46] . According to Jarvis and Lockwood [47] , the use of pentavalent antimonials is no longer recommended for HIV/VL-coinfected individuals owing to the high rates of failure and the level of toxicity associated with the treatment . These researchers emphasized the need for clinical tests to accelerate the development of more effective combined therapies and the planning of secondary prophylactic strategies . The Ministry of Health of Brazil [12] recommends HIV testing and the treatment with liposomal amphotericin B for all VL patients . Together with hemorrhagic complications , the presence of bacterial infections is known to be an important cause of death among VL-infected individuals [11] . Even though this review included only studies that analyzed the occurrence of infections at the time of admission , the presence of coinfections represented a strong predictor of adverse evolution . This finding indicates the importance of preventing general infections and of treating VL patients isolated from individuals with bacterial infections , furthermore it calls attention to the damaging impact of late diagnosis on increased lethality of VL . Unfortunately , a large proportion of patients seeking medical assistance at hospitals or health units already presented opportunist infections and , possibly , VL at an advanced stage . Severe neutropenia , characterized by the cut-off point of 500 neutrophils/mm3 [48] , also constituted a strong predictor of VL severity . Patients with this condition had a higher risk of VL-related death , possibly because they were more susceptible to bacterial infections . In such cases , the use of antibiotics and the constant monitoring of this parameter are mandatory throughout the course of treatment . Interestingly , diarrhea was a strong predictor of mortality . However , according to Werneck et al . [11] , the occurrence of melena may be incorrectly interpreted as diarrhea or enteric microorganisms may be responsible for the sepsis associated with clotting abnormalities . Dyspnoea was also a good indicator of increased risk of unfavorable evolution of VL , and assessment of this condition , together with that of diarrhea , should be a routine priority in clinical practice since evaluation of these two parameters is rapid and straightforward , and their presence is possibly the result of more severe complications [35] . Although age of the subject was a strong indicator of poor clinical course of VL , most studies included in the review used dissimilar cut-off points , and few analyzed age as a continuous variable . Nevertheless , the data revealed that children of less than five years ( especially those less than one year ) and adults above 40 years ( especially those older than 50 years ) are more likely to have an adverse evolution . The distribution of lethality with peaks among children and older adults suggests that different factors may be involved in the acquisition of infections and complications at different ages [32] . In particular , the elderly are more frequently affected by comorbidities , such as cardiovascular diseases and weaker immunological resistance , which may increase the risk of death [49] , [50] . On the other hand , children exhibit increased interleukin-10 levels and L-arginine secretion , which are factors associated with parasite persistence and greater VL severity . These parameters , coupled with the immaturity of the immune system , could explain the poor prognosis for this age group [42] , [51]\u2013[54] . Together with the strong prognostic factors of groups I and II ( Table S2 ) , it is worth considering the importance of the other groups of variables in the clinical evaluation of patients and for the purposes of improved disease management . For example , group III variables ( Table S2 ) were statistically significant according to meta-analysis and some ( but not the majority ) of the multivariate analysis . In particular , the presence of edema emerged as a relevant indicator of VL severity since , although not significant in half of the multivariate analyses , it was strongly associated with death , similarly to the presence of vomiting . The reduced strength of some relationships may be attributed to the specific therapeutic measures employed in some cases . For instance , individuals presenting hemoglobin levels below 7 g/dL would have received transfusions of packed red cells , as recommended by the Ministry of Health of Brazil [12] , and this strategy may have diminished not only the degree of anemia but also the strength of the association between hemoglobin and VL severity . Nevertheless , low hemoglobin concentration was strongly associated with death and , therefore , it represented a relevant prognosis factor . Regarding undernutrition , there is evidence suggesting that this condition is more a consequence of the wasting syndrome in VL rather than a risk factor for severity . Furthermore , the control of Leishmania replication by the adaptive immunosystem , particularly by Th1 cells , of undernourished patients could explain the lack of association between undernutrition and mortality risk [32] . Some other laboratory variables , such as leukocyte count and levels of albumin , alanine transaminase ( ALT ) and aspartate transaminase ( AST ) , constituted prognosis factors of intermediary evidence in the prediction of poor prognosis . Several potentially relevant variables could not be included in the categories of evidence proposed herein because of the scarcity of studies . Among these are factors that can be readily assessed in clinical practice with minimal cost and must be better evaluated in future research , for example , mean cell volume , eosinophil count , serum creatinine , inappetence , weakness or asthenia , dehydration , lymphadenopathy and occurrence of comorbidities such as diabetes , tuberculosis , heart or renal diseases and dengue fever . In this context , it is noteworthy that the influence of helminthiasis on the clinical evolution of VL was not investigated in any of the reviewed studies even though infection by intestinal parasitic worms is highly prevalent in urban and rural areas of Brazil [55] , [56] . It is well known that helminths can modulate and even suppress the immune response and , consequently , modify the clinical manifestations of diseases associated with the immune system [57] , [58] , hence this topic also should be included in future research . Other variables that require more specific and expensive tests , including myelogram , cardiovascular abnormalities , bilirubin levels , prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time , have also received little research attention . The present review provides a reliable source of information for the identification of risk factors of adverse prognosis and mortality in VL and should be used as an aid in decision-making in clinical practice . It is important to emphasize , however , that the results presented herein do not directly allow the creation and validation of prognostic scores based on the signs and symptoms presented by patients . Thus , studies should be carried out with the specific purpose of developing such scores and performing external validation of prognostic models already proposed , along with the incorporation of prognostic factors or additional biomarkers as recommended by Pencina et al . [59] . Assessment of the quality of the studies reviewed herein revealed that only five developed scores based on data obtained from the study populations , and no external validation of any kind was performed in these investigations . Prognostic models may present poor reproducibility and predictive performance when applied to other populations owing to the possibility of overfitting , the exclusion of some significant predictor , or differences between the characteristics of patients , health services or diagnostic methods [23] . According to Steyerberg et al . [60] , a prognostic model is only useful if it is able to predict with accuracy the outcome of a patient who was not a member of the source population , i . e . the cohort employed in the development of the model , and studies that do not include at least some form of internal validation procedure ( such as cross validation or bootstrapping ) are rarely acceptable for publication . The manual issued by the Ministry of Health of Brazil [12] describes the implementation of a validation of the prognostic model developed by Costa [32] , but does not include details regarding the procedures employed . For this reason , it is not possible to evaluate the score structure proposed in the model or to evaluate its potential applicability . However , this constitutes the first step in the formulation of a consistent prognostic model , with an impact that could be properly assessed , for application in different contexts in Brazil . Concerning other limitations in the analyzed studies , the procedures adopted to deal with the problem of missing information from medical records were generally unclear . According to Little and Rubin [61] , restricting an analysis to participants presenting complete records not only reduces the statistical power of the study but may also introduce bias . The pitfalls caused by missing data can be circumvented by the use of sophisticated statistical approaches especially designed for the imputation of missing information [62]\u2013[65] . Such procedures should be employed as an alternative in all future studies whenever a set of values of variables are absent from a cohort . The majority of studies considered in the present review failed to define the criteria adopted for the stratification of continuous variables . The quality of studies could be improved by adoption of credible and unequivocal clinical and analytical stratification criteria [66] , or by analyzing continuous variables according to their original scale [67] , [68] and by the implementation of appropriate procedures for the analysis of the functional form of their relationship with the outcome [69] , [70] . Although the majority of the reviewed studies can be considered acceptable with respect to the adequacy of case definitions , statistical methods and multivariate analyses adopted , there were limitations in the models in cases where no interaction or multi-colinearity tests between the predictor variables were performed . In most of the studies , various prognostic factors were analyzed and many of them could be correlated , thereby producing the same explanation of variability in outcome [71] . In such cases , it is not correct to maintain all of the correlated variables in modeling procedures and , in view of the low statistical power of these studies , the exclusion of redundant explanatory variables would be helpful in increasing the accuracy of the multivariate model . Considering the limitations of the present review , none of the studies conducted in other parts of the world were analyzed since those studies would reflect specific clinical , social and epidemiological characteristics distinct from those of VL in the Americas . Other relevant issues included the problem of combining data acquired from distinct populations ( in terms of areas and characteristics ) as well as the inability to explore the causes of heterogeneity of effect sizes between studies , and the impracticality of determining the existence of publication bias . Most studies described the results for all of the variables analyzed , but four articles did not provide data regarding some associations , particularly for non-significant variables , and this may have modified the true effect of some of the calculated summary measures . The force of these measures may also have been overestimated because of the use of odds ratio as a proxy for the relative risk [72] , [73] . Additionally , there is the limitation regarding the sources of information , since most of the primary studies used retrospective data collected from medical records . The consistency and accuracy of such data is often a topic of discussion among researchers [74] because of the differences that exist in standards and in methods of registering data from one hospital to another . This does not mean that the use of medical records for research purposes should be abandoned , but that information derived from them should be examined with caution , and that those responsible for managing and for completing the records should be encouraged to improve the quality of information provided . This is the first systematic review with meta-analysis on the prognosis factors relating to VL severity . The integration of information from different investigations conducted in Brazil in the last 10 years led to the identification of consistent predictor variables that might be useful in clinical practice for designing distinct therapies for patients at risk of an unfavorable outcome of the disease . The analysis of the quality of the published studies may be of assistance in future research , since positive features have been highlighted while logical criticism of the flaws , mainly relating to the external validation of multivariate prognostic models , has been offered . Similar assessments in different regions of the globe would be highly relevant since lethality of VL and the impact of this disease on our society can only be diminished by using consistent evidence-based medical approaches .", "headings": ["Abstract", "Introduction", "Methods", "Results", "Discussion"], "keywords": ["medicine and health sciences", "clinical research design", "infectious disease epidemiology", "tropical diseases", "epidemiological methods and statistics", "simulation and modeling", "research design", "mathematics", "clinical epidemiology", "statistics (mathematics)", "neglected tropical diseases", "veterinary science", "research and analysis methods", "infectious diseases", "veterinary diseases", "zoonoses", "epidemiology", "research assessment", "meta-analysis", "leishmaniasis", "systematic reviews", "biology and life sciences", "physical sciences", "statistical methods"], "id": "journal.pntd.0002982"}

It is suspected that high drug selective pressure might favor the emergence of chemoresistant parasites . Although treatment failure is frequently reported during antimonial therapy of both CL and VL , antimonial resistance has never been thoroughly investigated in Algeria . Determining the level of antimonial susceptibility , amongst Leishmania transmitted in Algeria , is of great importance for the development of public health policies . Within the framework of the knowledge about the epidemiology of VL and CL amassed during the last 30 years , we sampled Leishmania isolates to determine their susceptibility to antimony . We analyzed a total of 106 isolates including 88 isolates collected between 1976 and 2013 in Algeria from humans , dogs , rodents , and phlebotomines and 18 collected from dogs in France . All the Algerian isolates were collected in 14 localities where leishmaniasis is endemic . The 50% inhibitory concentrations ( IC50 ) of potassium antimony tartrate ( the trivalent form of antimony , Sb ( III ) ) and sodium stibogluconate ( the pentavalent form of antimony , Sb ( V ) ) were determined in promastigotes and intramacrophage amastigotes , respectively . The epidemiological cutoff ( ECOFF ) that allowed us to differentiate between Leishmania species causing cutaneous or visceral leishmaniases that were susceptible ( S+ ) or insusceptible ( S- ) to the trivalent form of antimony was determined . The computed IC50 cutoff values were 23 . 83 \u03bcg/mL and 15 . 91 \u03bcg/mL for VL and CL , respectively . We report a trend of increasing antimony susceptibility in VL isolates during the 30-year period . In contrast , an increase in the frequency of S- phenotypes in isolates causing CL was observed during the same period . In our study , the emergence of S- phenotypes correlates with the inclusion of L . killicki ( syn: L . tropica ) isolates that cause cutaneous leishmaniasis and that have emerged in Algeria during the last decade . Our results provide insight into the spatiotemporal dynamics of Leishmania antimony susceptibility in Algeria . We highlight the need for the future implementation of an effective methodology to determine the antimony susceptibility status of Leishmania isolates to detect the emergence of and prevent the dissemination of drug-resistant strains . \n Leishmaniasis are vector-borne diseases caused by obligate parasites from the genus Leishmania ( Trypanosomatida: Trypanosomatidae ) . This genus is subdivided into two major phylogenetic lineages: Euleishmania and Paraleishmania [1] . There are fifty-four named species of Leishmania ( without considering synonyms ) and approximately twenty species that are pathogenic to humans [2 , 3] ( www . leishmania . ird . fr ) . These diseases are endemic in large areas of the tropics and subtropics and in the Mediterranean basin , globally spanning more than 98 countries and territories . There are approximately 350 million people at risk for leishmanioses and approximately 12 million cases worldwide , with an estimated annual incidence of 0 . 7\u20131 . 2 million cases of CL and 0 . 2\u20130 . 4 million cases of VL [4] . Antimony ( Sb ) -containing compounds currently represent the first-line drugs for the treatment of all forms of leishmaniosis in most parts of the world , mainly for economic reasons . The antileishmanial and antitrypanosomal activity of Sb was investigated in the 1910s [5 , 6] , and Sb continues to be used in antiprotozoal drugs [7] . In 1997 , the first indications of therapeutic failure linked to Leishmania drug resistance were reported in the northern Bihar province of India [8\u201310] . In Algeria , cutaneous and visceral leishmanioses constitute a public health concern . Algeria ranks second , after Afghanistan , for the incidence of cutaneous leishmanioses [11] . The visceral form , recorded in humid and sub-humid regions located in the north of the country , is caused by Leishmania infantum , with dogs as the main reservoir and Phlebotomus perniciosus or P . longicuspis acting as vectors [12\u201316] . This disease affects mainly children under 5 years of age [17\u201320] . L . major , L . infantum and L . killicki ( syn L . tropica ) are the identified causative agents of the cutaneous forms of the disease in Algeria [21\u201323] . Cases of cutaneous leishmaniosis caused by L . major are widely distributed across the arid zones of the southern part of Algeria [24] . The identified mammalian reservoir hosts of L . major are wild rodents , including Psammomys obesus and Meriones shawi [25 , 26] . Its proven vector is Phlebotomus papatasi [27] . In the northern humid and sub-humid parts of the country , L . infantum is responsible for the sporadic form of CL . The main vector is P . perfilewi , and the reservoir hosts are dogs [28 , 29] . In addition , an outbreak of cutaneous leishmaniosis caused by L . killicki ( syn L . tropica ) and transmitted by Phlebotomus sergenti was detected in 2005 in the province of Ghardaia [21 , 30 , 31] . Canine leishmaniosis ( CanL ) caused by L . infantum is a zoonotic disease that affects millions of dogs [32] . The clinical features of the disease vary from subclinical , self-limiting infections to fatal disease [33] . In Algeria six zymodemes have been found to infect dogs , but the most frequently recorded is L . infantum , belonging to the MON-1 zymodeme [34 , 35] . In Algeria , pentavalent antimonials are the standard treatments for all forms of leishmaniosis . Treatment failures are frequently reported during antimonial therapy of both CL and VL [19 , 20 , 36 , 37] . The causes underlying treatment failures are multifactorial and interplay with certain host factors ( e . g . , host genetics and immunological responses ) , treatment features ( e . g . , drug quality , compliance with therapy ) , and the intrinsic drug susceptibility/resistance of Leishmania strains or species [8 , 38\u201341] . These multiple factors make the analysis of antimony treatment failures and antimony resistance challenging . In Algeria , as in most of the 98 countries where leishmanioses represent a major threat , no epidemiological information related to the antimony resistance status of Leishmania parasites is currently available . In the present study , we determined the antimony susceptibility profile of various Leishmania isolates belonging to species endemic in Algeria . We discuss the essential information obtained and its interpretation in the framework of public health interventions against leishmanioses in Algeria . \n We sought to determine the antimony susceptibility of Leishmania isolates for the most prevalent species transmitted in Algeria . The isolates used in the study are responsible for the visceral form of the disease ( L . infantum ) or for cutaneous forms ( L . infantum , L . major , and L . killicki syn L . tropica ) . They were collected from patients ( Homo sapiens ) , mammalian reservoirs ( Canis familiaris and Meriones shawi ) and phlebotomine sandflies ( Phlebotomus perniciosus and Phlebotomus papatasi ) ( Table 1 ) . Samples were collected during clinical and community-based studies conducted at the Pasteur Institute of Algiers since 1980 . They now constitute a documented collection of Leishmania clinical isolates that were previously typed at the zymodeme level [29 , 35 , 42] . These resources , in addition to demographic and other data ( clinical patterns , disease incidence , geographical locations of cases , etc . ) of the endemic foci studied , were exploited to examine the epidemiological associations . The geographical distribution of samples is given ( Fig 1A & 1B ) . Four ecological zones of unequal sizes compose Algeria . The northern Tell region has a Mediterranean climate characterized by warm , dry summers and cool , wet winters ( total annual rainfall is from 400 to 1000 mm ) . Natural forests are concentrated in a 100- to 200-km-wide belt in the northern part of the country that is more humid ( rainfall = 200\u2013400 mm ) . The Sahara Desert is an arid ( total annual rainfall >130 mm ) , windy area with large daily temperature differences . The Hoggar massif ( 7% of the country ) lies south of the Sahara . It is a succession of high-altitude desertic areas rising in terraces to an altitude of 2900 m . Administratively , Algeria is divided into 48 departments . In Algeria , leishmanioses have been reportable diseases since 1980 . The National Public Health Institute ( INSP ) gathers and centralizes information about cases of cutaneous and visceral leishmanioses from the 48 departments throughout the country . Data from the official case notifications were compiled from the epidemiological surveillance database of the INSP for a 30-year period from 1984 to 2013 . They result from passive monitoring based on the notifications registered by the epidemiological services of health sectors in the territories ( local public health facilities , public hospitals , and university hospitals ) . Private physicians are required to notify the INSP about VL cases . L . major , L . killicki and L . infantum parasites were isolated from patients and rodents by the medical staff of the national reference centers for leishmanioses ( Pasteur Institute of Algiers ) . They were then cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen until they were thawed for antimony susceptibility testing . The 24 Leishmania isolates from naturally infected dogs were collected by veterinary practitioners in various regions of Algiers between November 2006 and June 2008 ( Fig 1 , see insert ) . The popliteal lymph nodes were aspirated from symptomatic dogs , and a skin biopsy was taken from dogs with inoculation chancres on the nose . In addition , French Leishmania isolates were selected from the cryobank of the National Reference Centre for Leishmanioses in Montpellier , according to their sampling date and location . We choose to restrict our study to two canine leishmaniosis endemic foci , B\u00e9ziers and Montpellier . The origins and descriptions of the isolates used in this study are compiled in Table 1 . Prior to conducting the drug susceptibility assays , the species identity was re-confirmed by isoenzyme electrophoresis characterization and PCR-RFLP , as described elsewhere [43\u201345] . The susceptibility of the Leishmania strains to antimony was determined in vitro within four passages from their thawing . A total of 106 isolates were studied , 88 collected in Algeria and 18 in France ( S1 Table and S1 Fig ) . Among them , 37 were responsible for human cutaneous leishmanioses , and 21 were responsible for the visceral form . In addition , the susceptibility to antimony was determined in isolates collected from reservoirs or vectors , including 24 from dogs , 3 from sandflies and 3 from rodents . Isolates that originated in France were collected from dogs and sandflies . A cloned Sb ( III ) -resistant L . infantum strain ( ITMAP263-R/Sb3-120R ) and its sensitive counterpart ( ITMAP263 ) were used as controls [46] . Synthetic graphs showing the distributions of L . major , L . infantum , L . tropica ( L . killicki ) in the various selected localities and according to the clinic and the period of sampling are presented in S1 Fig . Isoenzymatic characterization was performed with starch gel electrophoresis according to Rioux ( 43 ) using the following 15 enzyme systems: malate dehydrogenase ( MDH ) , EC 1 . 1 . 1 . 37; malic enzyme ( ME ) , EC 1 . 1 . 1 . 40; isocitrate dehydrogenase ( ICD ) , EC 1 . 1 . 1 . 42; 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase ( PGD ) , EC 1 . 1 . 1 . 44; glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase ( G6PD ) , EC 1 . 1 . 1 . 49; glutamate dehydrogenase ( GLUD ) , EC 1 . 4 . 1 . 3; NADH diaphorase ( DIA ) , EC 1 . 6 . 2 . 2; purine nucleoside phosphorylases 1 ( NP1 ) , EC 2 . 4 . 2 . 1; purine nucleoside phosphorylases 2 ( NP2 ) EC 2 . 4 . 2; glutamate-oxaloacetate transaminases ( GOT1 and GOT2 ) , EC 2 . 6 . 1 . 1; phosphoglucomutase ( PGM ) , EC 5 . 4 . 2 . 2; fumarate hydratase ( FH ) , EC 4 . 2 . 1 . 2; mannose-phosphate isomerase ( MPI ) , EC 5 . 3 . 1 . 8; and glucose phosphate isomerase ( GPI ) , EC 5 . 3 . 1 . 9 . In the PCR-RFLP analysis , the entire internal transcribed spacer ( ITS ) in the ribosomal operon was amplified using LITSR ( 5\u2032-CTGGATCATTTTCCGATG-3\u2032 ) and LITSV ( 5\u2032-ACACTCAGGTCTGTAAAC-3\u2032 ) primers [45] . A 10-\u03bcL aliquot from the amplification product of the entire ITS region was then digested with HaeIII for 2 h at 37\u00b0C . The restriction fragments were then separated by electrophoresis on a 2% agarose gel for 2\u20134 h in 1x Tris-borate/EDTA ( 90 mM Tris-borate/0 . 2 mM EDTA ) buffer . The restriction fragments were visualized under UV light after ethidium bromide staining . A maximum of 5 passages in liquid culture media were performed before promastigote susceptibility assays . Promastigotes were maintained at 26\u00b0C in SDM-79 medium [47\u201348] supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum ( FCS ) , 50 \u03bcg/mL porcine hemin , 2 mM glutamine , 100 IU/mL penicillin , and 100 \u03bcsg/mL streptomycin . Promastigote susceptibility assay: growth inhibition of Leishmania treated with the trivalent form of antimony , Sb ( III ) , was determined by flow cytometry . Parasites were inoculated into 96-well plates at 106 parasites/mL in 100 \u03bcl of SDM-79 with fetal calf serum . Sb ( III ) antimony was added at final concentrations of 0 . 3 , 0 . 6 , 1 . 2 , 2 . 4 , 4 . 8 , 9 . 6 , 19 . 2 , 38 . 4 , and 76 . 8 \u03bcg/ml . After 3 days of culturing , 5 \u03bcL of the cell culture were taken and diluted into 500 \u03bcL of PBS ( pH 7 . 2 ) . Propidium iodide was added at a final concentration of 1 \u03bcg/mL , and the cells were counted by flow cytometry ( FACScalibur; Becton Dickinson ) for 52 sec . Fluorescence gated according to forward and side light scatter was collected and displayed using a logarithmic amplification ( FL2\u2013FL3 ) . The statistic quadrant allowed us to estimate the number of viable parasites . The parasite density was determined using standard curves , where parasite concentrations were plotted as a function of the mean number of cells counted after 52 sec . The fifty percent inhibitory concentration ( IC50 ) value was determined with GraphPad Prism 6 . 0 software ( GraphPad Software , La Jolla , CA , USA ) using a sigmoidal dose-response ( variable slope ) curve fitting equation that allowed the calculation of the concentration that inhibited the growth by 50% ( IC50 ) . The results are expressed as the means of three independent experiments performed in duplicate . Intramacrophagic amastigote susceptibility assay: the effect of Glucantime on Leishmania growth in a human leukemia monocyte cell line ( THP-1 cells ) was evaluated according to the method previously described [49] . THP-1 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FCS , 2 mM glutamine , 100 IU/mL penicillin , and 100 \u03bcg/mL streptomycin . THP-1 monocytes in the log phase of growth were differentiated into macrophages by incubation for 2 days in medium containing 20 ng/mL phorbol-myristate acetate . Macrophages were then infected with stationary-phase L . infantum promastigotes at a parasite:macrophage ratio of 5:1 for 4 h , at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2 . After removing non internalized parasites by washings , cultures were incubated in the presence of Glucantime for 5 days at 37\u00b0C in an atmosphere enriched with 5% CO2 . Medium added with Glucantime was renewed after 72 h incubation . Infected cells were then washed , fixed with methanol and stained with Giemsa . The parasitic index PI was then calculated as follows: PI ( % ) = ( percentage of infected macrophages \u00d7 number of intracellular parasites/macrophage in treated wells ) / ( percentage of infected macrophages \u00d7 number of intracellular parasites/macrophage in untreated wells ) \u00d7 100 . Then IC50 value was determined . Statistical analysis: Data were compiled in Microsoft Excel and analyzed using Prism 5 ( GraphPad , Inc ) . We computed standardised incidence ratios ( SIR ) that represent the ratio of the reported rate for CL and VL to the age-adjusted expected rate in the general population . This allow comparison between provinces taking the national average incidence rate as a reference , during the three decades studied . Leishmania isolates from each region were selected using a simple random sampling technique . Human leishmanioses ( VL & CL ) incidence were plotted on a map with an Open Source Geographic Information System QGIS 2 . 14 . We used the website http://download . geofabrik . de/africa/algeria-latest-free . shp . zip to download the administrative regions of Algeria and we obtained the georeferenced data on the cities of Algeria from http://dateandtime . info . For leishmania antimony susceptibility comparison , a one-factor ANOVA was performed to determine a significant difference between groups with differences in susceptibility to Sb ( III ) and Sb ( V ) between Algerian isolates according to clinical forms , Leishmania species , zymodems and spatial geographic distributions . ANOVA analysis was followed by Kruskal-Wallis ( KW ) tests and Dunn\u2019s post-test for multiple comparisons . Differences in the susceptibility to Sb ( III ) and Sb ( V ) among VL and CL isolates during two 10-years-time periods were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney non-parametric test . Correlation of susceptibility to Sb ( III ) and Sb ( V ) was estimated with the Spearman test . P values <0 . 05 were considered significant . Cutoff determination: The cutoff defining sensitive ( S+ ) and non sensitive ( S- ) promastigotes populations for Sb ( III ) was determined with the help of a web application: cutoff finder analysis using R version 2 . 15 . 0 ( 2012-03-30 ) ( http://molpath . charite . de/cutoff/ ) [50] . The cutoff for Sb ( V ) susceptibility was directly obtained by interpolation of the Sb ( III ) cutoff values . Clearance for the study was obtained from the Ministry of Health ( Direction of Prevention ) of Algeria . Informed consent was not obtained for our study because the data were analyzed anonymously . Leishmania isolates from human ( Homo sapiens ) were obtained from routine clinical works . Leishmania isolates from dogs ( Canis familiaris ) rodents ( Meriones shawi ) or sandflies ( Phlebotomus papatasi and Phlebotomus perniciosus ) were obtained from routine epidemiological studies in endemic areas . This study was exempted of an ethical approval . \n A schematic representation of the three geographic areas of Algeria and the total number of leishmanioses cases ( CL and VL ) recorded in those areas over the three consecutive decades studied are given ( S2 Fig ) . Between 1984 and 2013 , the greatest number of case notifications of VL occurred in 1998 , when 310 cases were reported . During this period , the highest incidence of VL was recorded in the Tell area ( Fig 2A and S2 Fig ) . An overall increase in the notification of VL cases was recorded between 1994 and 2003 , followed by a decrease during the subsequent decade ( Fig 2B ) . The calculated average annual incidence rate was 0 . 68 cases per 100 , 000 inhabitants in 1969 , 0 . 88 cases in 1985 and 1 . 02 cases in 1998 . In 2010 , a rebound was recorded , with 121 case notifications . Nevertheless , the incidence could be considered low , with 0 . 34 cases per 100 , 000 inhabitants ( Fig 2A and 2B ) . When the geographical distribution of VL cases was assessed , we observed a decrease in disease incidence in the historical foci of Bouira and Tizi Ouzou , that decrease from 1 . 55 and 0 . 79 cases per 100 , 000 inhabitants during the 1994 to 2003 period in Tizi Ouzou and Bouira respectiveley to 1 . 43 and 0 . 28 cases during the 2004 to 2013 period . In other regions , the situation has changed even more radically , with a total absence of notifications in recent years . This situation was found mainly in the northwest and the south . However , in Tamanrasset , located in Southeast Algeria , a resurgence in case notifications was observed . Overall , CL have a 30-fold higher incidence rate than the visceral form . The most affected areas are located on the steppes in the sub-Saharan areas of Algeria . Data collected from the monthly epidemiologic report published by the INSP showed that between 2004 and 2013 , the disease extended over the southern and northern portions of the country ( Fig 3A ) . Most of the CL notified cases came from the departments of Batna , Biskra and M'sila [24] . Several peaks of CL have occurred over the last 30 years , namely , in 1983 , 1986 , 1997 , 2005 and 2010 ( Fig 3B ) . The greatest number of cases was recorded in 2005 , when there were more than 25 , 000 . In 1991 , an incidence rate of 15 cases per 100 , 000 inhabitants was recorded , and this incidence rate remained almost unchanged five years later ( 14 . 44 cases per 100 , 000 inhabitants ) , but it reached 34 . 18 cases per 100 , 000 inhabitants in 1997 , 76 . 68 cases in 2005 and 58 . 41 cases in 2010 ( Fig 3B ) . Thus , the analyzed 30-year period demonstrates an overall decrease in the total number of VL cases in all endemic regions of Algeria and the opposite trend for CL cases . The correlation between the susceptibility of promastigotes and amastigotes to Sb ( III ) and Sb ( V ) was investigated with a panel of 73 of the 88 isolates that were representative of the diversity of all the Leishmania species with public health impacts in Algeria . The susceptibility of the promastigote forms to Sb ( III ) reflected the susceptibility of intracellular amastigotes to Sb ( V ) ( Spearman\u2019s correlation , P<0 . 0001 , r = 0 . 486 ) . This finding highlights the predictive value of the Sb ( III ) susceptibility of promastigotes for the Sb ( V ) susceptibility status of intracellular amastigotes ( Fig 4A ) . We then determined the IC50 ECOFF value for Sb ( III ) ( Sb ( III ) -ECOFF ) . The cutoff values for VL and CL isolates were determined with a method based on the data distribution . The output of the analysis was visualized as a histogram in which the cutoff value was defined at the peak ( Fig 4B ) . The ECOFF values were determined according to the clinical forms described as CL ( caused by some L . infantum variants , L . major , and L . killicki ( syn L . tropica ) ) or VL ( caused by L . infantum ) . The computed Sb ( III ) -ECOFF against promastigotes was 15 . 91 \u03bcg/mL among the species responsible for the VL forms and 23 . 83 \u03bcg/mL among the species responsible for the CL forms ( Fig 4B ) . The Sb ( V ) -ECOFF was then deduced via a direct projection of the Sb ( III ) -ECOFF values on the ordinate axis via the regression line ( Fig 4A ) . Using this approach , the Sb ( V ) -ECOFF values of 50 \u03bcg/mL ( blue dashed line ) and 30 \u03bcg/mL ( red dashed line ) were deduced for the Leishmania species responsible for CL and VL , respectively . Isolates responsible for VL in humans showed significantly lower susceptibility to Sb ( III ) than those responsible for CL ( Fig 5A ) . Leishmania isolates collected from their reservoirs ( dogs or rodents ) or vectors were mostly highly susceptible to trivalent antimony ( Fig 5A , see CanL , Rodent L , Phleb L ) . Tukey's multiple comparison test revealed highly significant differences in antimony susceptibility between Leishmania species ( p value <0 . 0001 ) . We then categorized the isolates as susceptible ( S+ , IC50 below the ECOFF value ) or insusceptible ( S- , IC50 above the ECOFF value ) according to the previously determined Sb ( III ) - and Sb ( V ) -ECOFF values . The analysis revealed that approximately 52% ( 13/25 ) and 48% ( 10/21 ) of the isolates collected from patients suffering from VL were not susceptible to Sb ( III ) and Sb ( V ) , respectively ( Fig 5A , 5B and 5C ) . For the L . infantum strains collected from dogs , less than 10% ( 2/32 ) were of the S- phenotype for Sb ( III ) , and that proportion reached 26% for Sb ( V ) ( Fig 5A , 5B and 5C ) . Among the isolates responsible for CL , only 10 of the 43 tested isolates ( 30% ) were S- with regard to Sb ( III ) , exhibiting an IC50 above the determined Sb ( III ) -ECOFF threshold , while 50% of the isolates ( 14/28 ) were S- with regard to Sb ( V ) . Interestingly , all the parasites isolated from an arthropod vector or a rodent host ( Fig 6A see LPhleb , LRodent ) were S+ . We observed that with an IC50 of 8 . 19\u00b10 . 91 \u03bcg/mL , L . major isolates were generally significantly more susceptible ( P<0 . 001 ) to Sb ( III ) than were the isolates of L . infantum ( IC50 of 19 . 33\u00b12 . 47 \u03bcg/mL ) or L . killicki ( IC50 of 37 . 25\u00b19 . 30 \u03bcg/mL ) ( P<0 . 001 ) ( Fig 5D ) . A similar trend was observed in intramacrophagic amastigotes ( Fig 5E ) . Overall , approximately 30% of the isolates fell within the S- category ( 27/88 ) with regard to Sb ( III ) ( Fig 5F ) . This proportion was higher when the classification was performed with the Sb ( V ) -ECOFF threshold: 53% ( 39/73 ) . Among the species causing CL , all L . killicki strains were classified as S- ( 8/8 ) with regard to Sb ( III ) ( Fig 5D ) , while 5/8 ( 62 . 5% ) fell within the S- category when using the Sb ( V ) -ECOFF value ( Fig 5E ) . For L . major , only 6% were S- with regard to Sb ( III ) , but 67% were S- with regard to Sb ( V ) , depicting a fairly poor congruence between the two methods . The reasons underlying these results are unknown and need to be investigated further . All the isolates collected in the southern departments were less susceptible to Sb ( III ) ( IC50 of 31 . 71\u00b18 . 22 \u03bcg/mL ) than those isolated from patients residing in the Tell area ( 19 . 32 \u00b1 2 . 57 \u03bcg/mL ) or in the high plains ( 10 . 36 \u00b1 2 . 11 \u03bcg/mL ) ( p<0 . 01 ) ( Fig 6A ) . Most of the isolates from the high plains , where the main foci of transmission are located , are clustered below the Sb ( III ) -ECOFF value for VL and CL . Only two isolates are S- . In the region of the Tell , a wide variation in Sb ( III ) susceptibility was recorded , with a mean IC50 of 19 . 32 \u00b1 2 . 57 \u03bcg/mL ( Fig 6A ) . In Leishmania species causing VL , a general trend of increased susceptibility to Sb ( III ) has been recorded , with mean IC50 values for Sb ( III ) of 35 . 18 \u00b1 6 . 61 \u03bcg/mL for samples collected before 1994 , 30 . 01 \u00b1 5 . 97 \u03bcg/mL for the decade 1994\u20132003 , and 22 . 13\u00b1 2 . 71 \u03bcg/mL for the following decade from 2004 to 2013 ( Fig 6B ) . In contrast , for the isolates causing CL , a decrease in susceptibility to Sb ( III ) has been recorded with an increasing mean IC50 over the same period of time: 4 . 76 \u00b1 0 . 75 \u03bcg/mL for isolates sampled before 1994 and 16 . 63 \u03bcg/mL for the decade 2004\u20132013 ( Fig 6C ) . In this latter decade , isolates displaying a lower susceptibility to Sb ( III ) emerged: 8 isolates ( L . killicki ( syn L . tropica ) ) out of 29 ( 28% ) had IC50 values above the Sb ( III ) -ECOFF threshold . To summarize , while 50% of the isolates from VL cases collected before 1994 displayed an IC50 value above the Sb ( III ) -ECOFF value , this proportion decreased to less than 20% in the decade 2004\u20132013 . For CL , before 2004 , no isolate displayed an IC50 for Sb ( III ) above the Sb ( III ) -ECOFF threshold , but this proportion increased to 30% during the last decade of the study ( Fig 6D ) . An overview of Sb ( V ) susceptibility of leishmania isolates collected during the 3 decades is given ( S3 Fig ) . The analysis of the isoenzymatic polymorphisms of the Leishmania populations revealed six zymodemes in Algeria ( Table 1 ) . Among the L . infantum isolates selected in the biobank , 28 ones belonged to the MON-1 zymodeme , 4 to MON-24 , 4 to MON-80 , and 6 to MON-281 ( Fig 7A & 7B ) . L . major and L . killicki ( syn L . tropica ) strains belonged to MON-25 and MON-301 , respectively . All the isolates characterized as L . killicki ( syn L . tropica ) belonged to MON-301 . In addition , 5 isolates could not be identified either at the species or at the zymodeme level , because they did not display a characteristic PCR-RFLP profile or canonical isoenzyme profiles , they were therefore labeled \u201cnot determined\u201d ( ND ) . Analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) revealed a significant association between zymodemes and Sb ( III ) susceptibility ( p<0 . 01 ) . None of the L . infantum isolates belonging to the MON-24 zymodeme exhibited IC50 values above the Sb ( III ) -ECOFF threshold ( Fig 7A ) . However , 25% of the isolates characterized as L . infantum MON-80 ( 1/4 ) exhibited an IC50 value above the computed cutoff value; the corresponding proportions were 33% for L . infantum MON-1 ( 10/32 ) and 40% for L . infantum MON-281 ( 2/5 ) . More than 90% ( 25/26 ) of the L . major isolates of the MON-25 zymodeme were classified as S+ . Interestingly all the L . killicki ( MON-301 ) isolates exhibited an IC50 value above the Sb ( III ) -ECOFF value . Tukey's multiple comparison test revealed a significant difference ( P<0 . 05 ) in Sb ( III ) susceptibilities for the L . killicki MON-301 isolates compared with the other isolates responsible for CL: L . major ( MON-25 ) and L . infantum ( MON-24 ) ( Fig 7A & 7B ) . In the Mediterranean area , L . infantum is the causative agent of the visceral form of leishmaniosis , affecting both humans and dogs . While in France , canine leishmaniosis was caused only by L . infantum strains of the MON 1 zymodeme , in Algeria , two zymodemes infected dogs , MON-1 and MON-281 . Taking advantage of the large number of Leishmania strains and isolates in the collection of the National Reference Centre for Leishmania in Montpellier ( France ) , we selected a set of 17 previously characterized isolates from the Languedoc-Roussillon foci and evaluated their susceptibility to Sb ( III ) . As illustrated in Fig 7C , all French isolates exhibited quite uniform susceptibility to Sb ( III ) and were S+ . They were significantly more susceptible to Sb ( III ) than those from Algeria ( Student\u2019s t-test p<0 . 001 ) . We noticed that 35% of the tested L . infantum MON-1 isolates from Algeria were S- . \n Leishmaniosis is a globally re-emerging disease in several regions of the world [51 , 52] . In Algeria , several outbreaks have occurred over the last 30 years , the most significant of which occurred in 2005 , when more than 25 , 000 cases of CL were reported . The population at risk of contracting leishmanioses is large and has increased with the changing demography of the Algerian population during the last 30 years . The incidence of CL in the province of Biskra is significant , with up to 488 cases per 100 , 000 inhabitants reported between 2004 and 2013 . A survey performed in the region of Batna from 2009 to 2014 showed that over 25% of the military personnel present in this area were clinically diagnosed as positive for CL . In Tunisia , VL is also endemic in the northern part of the country , and its incidence shows a general decreasing trend , with 100 cases/year reported between 1996 and 2006 [53] . CL caused by L . major is a major public health problem in Tunisia . CL occurs mainly in the central and southwestern regions ( semi-arid and arid areas ) , with up to 60% of the population infected in some villages [4 , 22] . CL caused by L . killicki ( syn . L . tropica ) is also present and is distributed in independent foci [54] . In Morocco , VL is endemic in the Rift and pre-Rift mountains , with over 150 cases per year reported from 2006 to 2008 [4 , 55] . CL caused by L . major , which was previously sporadic , has been epidemic since 1976 . It occurs in unpredictable outbreaks in the south and the southeast regions of the Atlas Mountains and has recently migrated from the west to the east of the country . In 2001 , the Moroccan Health Office reported 2 , 028 CL cases caused by L . major and L . tropica , and 3 , 414 cases in 2008 , indicating a sharp increase in the incidence of leishmanioses in Morocco [4 , 55] . Among the 3 clinically important Leishmania species ( L . infantum , L . major , L . tropica ) , L . tropica exhibits the widest geographic distribution and is considered a major public health threat . Currently , the first line of defense against leishmanioses relies on the use of chemotherapy . In Algeria , once they are diagnosed , CL and VL cases are systematically treated . This treatment is delivered free of charge , as recommended by the WHO . Nevertheless , it is estimated that only two-thirds of CL cases are currently treated . The guidelines for the therapeutic protocols for treating patients with CL have been implemented according to the WHO recommendations and published by the Health Office . For all CL , the protocol consists of the administration of 20 mg/kg/day Glucantime for 15 days , via intramuscular injection when multiple lesions are observed or if the lesion is located on the face . For single lesions , the Health Office recommends intradermic ( intralesional ) administration of 1 . 5 to 2 mL of Glucantime twice per week for 4 weeks . Nevertheless , alternative treatment strategies are also employed , including the use of oxygenated water either alone or in combination with Glucantime . To treat VL , the Health Office follows the WHO recommendations of intramuscular injections of Glucantime at 20 mg/kg/day for 30 days . Unresponsiveness to treatment and/or relapses are well-documented features in Algeria as well as in the surrounding Mediterranean countries [36 , 56\u201360] . The finding that strains with low susceptibility to antimonials are transmitted as well as other strains should drive researchers to conduct studies on the circulation of antimony-resistant strains in Mediterranean countries [39] . The first limitation of such studies lies in the antimony susceptibility test of Leishmania parasites . Intracellular amastigotes clearly represent the ideal form of the parasites to be assayed . Unfortunately , methods that involve intracellular amastigotes are labor intensive , difficult to standardize , and dependent upon the nature of the host cell [49 , 61\u201364] . The development of reporter gene technologies has enabled the quantification of Leishmania parasites in host cells and whole mammalian hosts [65\u201368] , and the capacity of these technologies to determine the drug susceptibility of Leishmania field isolates has been tested [56 , 69] . However , these methods require transfection of the parasites with a reporter gene and the selection of recombinant parasites , which may affect the composition of the isolates [70] . Therefore , their utility for the assessment of Leishmania field isolates is limited . Various Leishmania species can be grown in vitro as amastigotes under axenic conditions [65 , 71\u201373] . The determination of drug activity is simple , typically inexpensive and does not require host cells , which makes standardization easier . However , not all Leishmania species or strains can be grown in axenic culture conditions . Concerning promastigotes , their usefulness in ascertaining the antimony susceptibility status of Leishmania field isolates is a matter of debate . Because these forms are not susceptible to pentavalent antimony , Sb ( III ) must be used in these tests . Unfortunately , the susceptibility of Leishmania promastigotes to Sb ( III ) does not appear to always reflect the sensitivity of the intramacrophagic forms to pentavalent antimonial formulations [8 , 74\u201376] . Interestingly , various experimental studies involving L . tropica [56] and L . donovani [77] support the notion that the Sb ( III ) susceptibility of promastigotes is predictive of the Sb ( V ) susceptibility of intramacrophagic amastigotes . The present study supports the notion that the Sb ( III ) susceptibility of promastigotes can be considered predictive of the Sb ( V ) susceptibility of intramacrophagic amastigotes . Nevertheless , for L . major , we noticed a bias in the predictive value of the antimony susceptibility of promastigotes . This discrepancy might reflect differences between Leishmania strains or species in the activities of reductases involved in the activation of Sb ( V ) . This role is assumed to belong to two reductases , namely , TDR1 , a thiol-dependent reductase that belongs to the glutathione S-transferases family and shares homology with the T . cruzi Tc52 protein [78] , and LmACR2 , which exhibits homology with the arsenate reductases [79] . However , some variations in the reductase capacity of field Leishmania isolates have yet to be investigated . This discrepancy can also reflect the role of some host-derived microbicidal factors involved in Sb ( V ) -induced intracellular killing of L . major parasites . Finally , the observed discrepancy may also be related to the greater difficulty of standardizing the intracellular amastigote susceptibility testing system for L . major . Antibiotic resistance is currently considered a major threat to human health [80] . In recent years , a global effort to provide a framework aimed at harmonizing the methodologies used to diagnose and monitor antimicrobial susceptibility has been initiated . In Europe , such efforts were first implemented in 1997 by the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Disease ( ESCMID ) , which formed the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing ( EUCAST ) ( http://www . eucast . org/ ) . However , no such efforts have been made for leishmanioses . Because CL and VL constitute a threatening public health concern in Algeria , an effort to survey parasite resistance was launched . In this analysis , we did not categorize isolates as resistant versus susceptible ones because we did not have documented information about the clinical features in humans and dogs or the Sb-resistant genotypes of isolates . Therefore , the lack of well-defined antimony-resistant Leishmania field isolates and the limited number of samples available only allowed us to determine the ECOFF value that defined the threshold between susceptible ( S+ ) and insusceptible ( S- ) parasite populations , without predicting the presence of truly resistant parasites in the latter . This epidemiological cutoff value could help to clarify the classification of Leishmania isolates according to their antimony-susceptibility status . The determination of ECOFF values allows the identification of isolates with low susceptibility that represent a basis for further genetic studies . The epidemiological cutoff for bacteria is defined by an MIC value that identifies the upper limit for the susceptibility of the wild-type population . Consequently , a microorganism is defined as wild-type if it does not display mutational mechanisms of resistance acquired against a given compound . The IC50 cutoff values that we have determined for Leishmania transmitted in Algeria are 23 . 83 \u03bcg/mL and 15 . 91 \u03bcg/mL for isolates responsible for VL and CL , respectively . We therefore propose a first definition for the susceptible phenotype ( S+ ) and insusceptible phenotype ( S- ) of Leishmania isolates . This attempt to define the susceptible population of Leishmania will be the first step towards the definition of clinical breakpoints , which will be of interest in investigating more precisely the link between the isolate susceptibility to antimony and the clinical outcomes . Additional studies taking other clinical data into account , particularly the clinical response to treatment , would allow more precise definitions of the clinical breakpoints for the Leishmania species responsible for VL and CL . Based on the ECOFF values defined for Leishmania species causing VL and CL , we found that L . killicki ( syn L . tropica ) , which was collected in the endemic CL area of Ghardaia [80] , appears to not be susceptible to Sb ( III ) antimony , and the majority of the isolates ( 5/8 ) were also not susceptible to Sb ( V ) . The expansion of these peculiar taxa in Algeria explains the increase in the frequency of the ( S- ) phenotype detected during the last decade ( 2004\u20132013 ) in our study . Another striking observation was the global decrease in the frequency of the ( S- ) phenotype in Leishmania strains causing the human VL over the last three decades . This feature must be confirmed with a larger number of isolates available in the biobank of the Pasteur Institute of Algiers . Interestingly , isoenzyme genotyping presents some predictive value for the identification of the susceptible phenotype . Indeed all L . infantum strains of the MON-24 zymodeme were ( S+ ) , while all L . killicki ( L . tropica ) strains belonging to the MON-301 zymodeme exhibited an ( S- ) phenotype . It would be interesting to further analyze the antimony susceptibility status of additional L . killicki MON-301 and L . infantum MON 24 isolates to strengthen the observations of the current study . We compared the antimony susceptibility phenotypes of isolates from two geographically distinct regions that differ in terms of the history of antimony consumption: ( i ) Algiers ( Algeria ) , where there is low antimony pressure in the canine reservoir , and ( ii ) C\u00e9vennes ( France ) , where antimony has been widely used to treat canine leishmaniosis since the 1980s . All isolates belonged to the L . infantum MON-1 zymodeme . The French isolates appeared to be sensitive to Sb ( III ) ( S+ ) , while 35% of the Algerian isolates were not ( S- ) . These results revealed a significant difference in antimony susceptibility between the two regions . This observation might indicate that drug pressure is not the only underlying factor that triggers the selection of antimony resistant strains in the field [81] . This study is the first one to address the occurrence of the transmission of Leishmania isolates with low susceptibility to antimony in Algeria . Leishmanioses are classified by the WHO as neglected tropical diseases , and there are limited resources for chemotherapy . It is therefore of interest to preserve the therapeutic efficiency of antimonials to cure leishmanioses by preventing the emergence of drug-resistant organisms .", "headings": ["Abstract", "Introduction", "Materials and methods", "Results", "Discussion"], "keywords": ["medicine and health sciences", "tropical diseases", "geographical locations", "vertebrates", "microbiology", "parasitic diseases", "parasitic protozoans", "animals", "mammals", "dogs", "protozoan life cycles", "organisms", "developmental biology", "protozoans", "leishmania", "antimony", "neglected tropical diseases", "algeria", "promastigotes", "africa", "infectious diseases", "zoonoses", "life cycles", "chemistry", "protozoan infections", "amastigotes", "people and places", "leishmania infantum", "eukaryota", "leishmaniasis", "biology and life sciences", "protozoology", "physical sciences", "amniotes", "chemical elements"], "id": "journal.pntd.0006310"}
{"lay_summary": "Western societies have a disproportionately high rate of inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) , with growing incidence especially in the adolescent population . A large body of evidence supports the view that bacteria in the gut participate in the pathophysiology of human bowel diseases . The unifying concept is chronic inflammation that is driven by microbial stimulation of the mucosal immune system . However , the mechanisms by which pathogenic or commensal microbes work in concert with each other and with host responses to perpetuate this inflammation is not well known . Adherent-invasive E . coli ( AIEC ) are Crohn\u2019s disease ( CD ) -associated bacteria that are implicated in disease pathology . AIEC are pro-inflammatory and may play a central role in maintaining chronic inflammation in response to other CD risk factors , such as acute infectious gastroenteritis . Here , we show that indeed , acute infectious gastroenteritis creates an inflammatory environment in the gut that drives AIEC expansion and worsens disease severity . The increase in disease severity strictly correlates with this AIEC bloom because blocking this bloom by sensitizing AIEC to host defenses also improves the health status of the host . The long time period between recovery from acute gastroenteritis and new onset CD may allow for targeted interventions to mitigate the risk of CD in AIEC-positive individuals .", "article": "Crohn\u2019s disease ( CD ) is a chronic inflammatory condition of diverse etiology . Exposure to foodborne pathogens causing acute gastroenteritis produces a long-term risk of CD well into the post-infectious period but the mechanistic basis for this ongoing relationship to disease onset is unknown . We developed two novel models to study the comorbidity of acute gastroenteritis caused by Salmonella Typhimurium or Citrobacter rodentium in mice colonized with adherent-invasive Escherichia coli ( AIEC ) , a bacterial pathobiont linked to CD . Here , we show that disease activity in the post-infectious period after gastroenteritis is driven by the tissue-associated expansion of the resident AIEC pathobiont , with an attendant increase in immunopathology , barrier defects , and delays in mucosal restitution following pathogen clearance . These features required AIEC resistance to host defense peptides and a fulminant inflammatory response to the enteric pathogen . Our results suggest that individuals colonized by AIEC at the time of acute infectious gastroenteritis may be at greater risk for CD onset . Importantly , our data identify AIEC as a tractable disease modifier , a finding that could be exploited in the development of therapeutic interventions following infectious gastroenteritis in at-risk individuals . \n Inflammation in Crohn\u2019s disease ( CD ) can involve the small and large bowel and is accompanied by changes in the microbial composition and distribution at these sites [1\u20133] . Clinical observations have been consistent in finding increased numbers of bacteria associated with the epithelial mucosa in Crohn\u2019s patients , including members of the Enterobacteriaceae that are enriched in virulence and secretion pathways as determined by culture and molecular methods [4\u20136] . Although a detailed microbiologic analysis of this population has not been done and their role in disease has not been described , these data imply that the environment favoring bacterial expansion at the mucosal surface is inflammatory in nature and that this particular bacterial bloom is of pathogenic significance in the disease . Among bacteria linked to CD , adherent-invasive E . coli ( AIEC ) have emerged as having likely pathogenic significance . Since its discovery in 1998 [7] , several laboratories have reported a higher prevalence of AIEC in CD patients compared to healthy subjects and confirmed their pro-inflammatory potential [5 , 8 , 9] . Although AIEC share evolutionary ancestry with extraintestinal pathogenic E . coli [10] , their infection biology suggests a pathobiont lifestyle that is distinct from frank enteric pathogens . A growing body of work indicates that different host environments can select for AIEC . For example , AIEC isolated from adults [5 , 10\u201312] , children [13 , 14] , and companion animals [15] exhibit a degree of genetic diversity that has made it difficult to discriminate this E . coli pathotype at a molecular level . AIEC can also be isolated from seemingly healthy individuals ( albeit much less frequently than in CD ) , implying that interactions between AIEC and other microbes or host genes might be needed to elicit their pathogenic character . CD is more common in individuals exposed to acute infectious gastroenteritis caused by Salmonella and other enteric pathogens , sometimes with onset times on the order of years after the infectious episode [16\u201318] . The mechanistic basis for this long-term risk association following an acute event lasting ~2 weeks is unresolved , however one possibility is that resident gut microbes could perpetuate inflammatory reactions in the post-infectious period . This relates to several clinical observations [19 , 20] . First , acute infectious gastroenteritis increases the risk of CD onset , often through an intermediate state of post-infectious-irritable bowel syndrome ( IBS ) [16\u201318]; second , gastroenteritis causes inflammation that selectively disrupts the resident intestinal microbiota in favor of some members of the Enterobacteriaceae [21 , 22]; and third , intestinal infections with frank enteric pathogens have been implicated as a probable cause of relapse in inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) patients [23 , 24] . We developed two new models to study comorbidity following acute infectious gastroenteritis in hosts colonized by an AIEC pathobiont from a Crohn\u2019s disease patient . We show that AIEC-colonized mice that develop infectious gastroenteritis in response to either Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium ( S . Typhimurium ) , or the attaching and effacing mouse pathogen Citrobacter rodentium , have a worsened outcome compared to AIEC-na\u00efve animals exposed to the same infection stimuli . Bacterial gastroenteritis induced an AIEC bloom in the ileum and colon accompanied by an increase in disease severity . The increase in disease severity strictly correlated with this AIEC bloom because blocking AIEC expansion by sensitizing the bacteria to host defenses ameliorated disease status , providing a direct correlation between AIEC and host damage . These data are the first to show that acute gastroenteritis modulates AIEC levels in the colonized gut , and establish AIEC as an active yet tractable disease modifier in response to acute infectious gastroenteritis . \n To study the link between acute infectious gastroenteritis and susceptibility to CD we developed a co-infection model that leveraged a model of chronic colonization of wild type mice with AIEC strain NRG857c [25] . This isolate from a patient with Crohn\u2019s disease colonizes both 129e and C57BL/6 mouse strains , allowing for non-lethal secondary infections with S . Typhimurium and C . rodentium , respectively . First , groups of 129e mice were colonized with AIEC for 14 days or remained AIEC-na\u00efve , and then exposed to S . Typhimurium to invoke acute infectious gastroenteritis ( Fig 1A ) . Polymicrobial infection with AIEC and S . Typhimurium lead to significantly worsened clinical outcome in 129e mice compared to mono-infected mice . All mice infected with either AIEC or S . Typhimurium alone survived for the duration of the experiment ( 35 days ) , whereas ~ 50% of the co-infected mice died over a 6-week period after the secondary Salmonella infection ( Fig 1B ) . More severe disease was evident in the co-infected cohort , which had diarrhoea , dehydration , hunched posture , and significant body weight loss at ~ day 5 after infectious gastroenteritis was initiated ( Fig 1C ) . Overall these results indicated that prior colonization by AIEC worsened the clinical outcome of infectious gastroenteritis . Infection of AIEC-colonized mice with S . Typhimurium was accompanied by non-segmented watery stool , a reduction in cecal and colon size and a hardened rubbery texture of the gut with occasional ulcerations ( Fig 2A ) . Histochemical analysis performed on H&E-stained cecal sections from S . Typhimurium infected mice showed only focal submucosal edema and mild to moderate epithelial hyperplasia , whereas co-infected mice had dramatic epithelial destruction along with extensive transmural inflammation , edema , and loss of crypt architecture ( Fig 2B ) . When quantified , the histopathology in co-infected mice was significantly greater than in mice monocolonized with either AIEC or S . Typhimurium ( Fig 2C ) . Nitric oxide is a biomarker for active bowel inflammation and is directly correlated with disease activity in IBD patients [26] . We measured nitrite levels in the cecum from animals either monocolonized with AIEC or S . Typhimurium , or co-infected with both . Cecal nitrite levels were significantly higher in mice co-infected with AIEC and S . Typhimurium , consistent with the immunopathology observed previously ( Fig 2D ) . Ulceration and damage to the mucosal epithelium in co-infected mice suggested permeability defects in the epithelial barrier . To test this we gavaged mice with fluorescein isothicyanate ( FITC ) -dextran ( FD4 ) and measured translocation of FD4 from the gut lumen to the serum . These results showed a significant increase in serum FD4 in all infected mouse groups compared to uninfected control mice , with the largest increase seen in S . Typhimurium-infected mice pre-colonized with AIEC ( Fig 2E ) . The higher rates of mortality seen in S . Typhimurium-infected 129e mice harbouring resident AIEC was reminiscent of mortality profiles in susceptible mouse lines such as C57BL/6 that do not constrain S . Typhimurium and develop lethal levels of bacteremia . Therefore , we hypothesized that prior AIEC colonization was driving a Salmonella-induced disease process , however this was inconsistent with the S . Typhimurium colonization data . By measuring S . Typhimurium loads in the feces over time we found that 129e controlled S . Typhimurium similarly in both AIEC-colonized and AIEC-na\u00efve animals , with colonization rates similar to that found in other studies [27] . Indeed , Salmonella colonization levels decreased over time in line with the ability of 129e mice to restrict the growth of S . Typhimurium [28] ( Fig 3A ) . Consistent with these data , the tissue-associated levels of S . Typhimurium in the cecum , ileum and spleen were similar in monocolonized and co-infected animals ( Fig 3B ) , indicating that AIEC did not alter the ability of the host to control S . Typhimurium . After AIEC colonization , 129e mice maintain stable AIEC levels [25] . In contrast to Salmonella loads in our model , we found dramatic and reproducible increases in the levels of AIEC following acute infectious gastroenteritis that was reflected only in the tissue-associated bacterial population . This bacterial bloom was not evident in the bulk luminal population isolated from the feces , however we found a 2-log and 3-log increase in tissue-associated AIEC levels in the cecum and ileum , respectively ( Fig 3C ) . Culture-independent methods have found that ileal CD lesions are enriched in Enterobacteriacae containing pathobiont-associated properties such as adhesion and invasion [5] , a finding that has been confirmed in functional metagenomic studies [4] . To test whether this AIEC bloom was specific to this pathobiont or reflected a more generalized permissive niche for E . coli , we repeated these experiments with mice colonized with a rifampicin-resistant derivative of the human commensal E . coli K12 . Despite showing stable colonization levels before infectious gastroenteritis , Salmonella infection caused a dramatic decrease in E . coli K12 levels in both the feces and tissue-associated samples ( Fig 3D ) , which was in contrast to the bloom seen by AIEC . These results are consistent with the susceptibility of commensal E . coli to Salmonella-induced inflammation , leading to E . coli killing in the inflamed gut [29] . Together these results support the hypothesis that acute infectious gastroenteritis creates a specialized niche permissive for the AIEC pathobiont with enhanced fitness under inflamed conditions , and are consistent with the selective increase in invasive tissue-associated E . coli in CD biopsies [4 , 5] . CD is characterized by a heightened inflammatory state in the gut [30] . We next characterized the inflammatory environment in the gut that selected for AIEC outgrowth five days after infectious gastroenteritis was initiated . Immunohistochemical analysis showed a significant increase in the number of infiltrated F4/80+ , GR1+ , and CD3+ cells in the cecum of AIEC-colonized mice at day 5 after S . Typhimurium infection , compared to the monocolonized or uninfected control groups ( Fig 4A and 4B ) . These immune cell populations were heavily concentrated in the lamina propria compared to the singly infected groups as well as the PBS control group . The lamina propria of CD lesions contains elevated levels of tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 ( TNF-\u03b1 ) and IL-17 , which might be involved in the maintenance of transmural intestinal inflammation [27 , 31] . There was a significant increase in TNF-\u03b1 and IL-17 in cecal supernatants from AIEC-colonized mice exposed to Salmonella gastroenteritis compared to either monocolonized mice or uninfected controls ( Fig 4C and 4D ) . TNF-\u03b1 is a proinflammatory cytokine involved in the secondary induction of chemokines and is the target of biologic therapy used in CD [32] . Consistent with the TNF-\u03b1 and cellular responses seen in the cecum there was increased levels of released MIG , IP-10 and MIP-1\u03b2 chemokines in AIEC colonized mice exposed to S . Typhimurium ( Fig 4E ) . Together these data indicated that prior AIEC status of the host had a dramatic impact on disease outcome following acute infectious gastroenteritis . Whereas AIEC-na\u00efve hosts developed a self-limiting infectious gastroenteritis , hosts with indwelling AIEC had heightened immunopathology , immune cell infiltration , and a marked expansion of tissue-associated AIEC loads in the gut . We previously discovered a genomic island ( PI-6 ) on an extrachromosomal plasmid in AIEC strain NRG857c that confers resistance to human host defense peptides through the action of antimicrobial peptide resistance locus , arlABC . ArlA is a Mig-14 family member protein implicated in defensin resistance in Salmonella , ArlB is a predicted NAD-dependent epimerase , and ArlC is an OmpT family outer membrane protease that cleaves cationic antimicrobial peptides [33 , 34] . In order to test whether the worsened disease outcome following infectious gastroenteritis was directly linked to expansion of AIEC in the gut , we colonized mice with an AIEC \u0394PI-6 mutant that is sensitive to killing by defensins , cathelicidins , and by the antimicrobial activity of the monokine MIG/CXCL9 [34] , and tested whether this peptide-sensitive mutant could expand in the post-infectious period following gastroenteritis . Consistent with previous experiments , wild type AIEC expanded 2\u20133 logs in the cecum and ileum following S . Typhimurium gastroenteritis and lead to ~50% host mortality . In contrast , the \u0394PI-6 mutant showed no expansion following infectious gastroenteritis in either the cecum or the ileum and none of these co-infected mice succumbed to infection ( Fig 5A and 5B ) , providing a direct link between AIEC expansion and disease outcome . To confirm that fulminant gastroenteritis elicited by S . Typhimurium was required for maximal AIEC expansion and for AIEC-dependent pathology , we used an avirulent Salmonella mutant that invokes less host inflammation due to loss of the type 3 secretion system-1 ( T3SS-1 ) and T3SS-2 [29] ( \u0394invA \u0394ssaR; labeled S . tmAvir ) . Co-infection with this Salmonella mutant blunted the AIEC expansion compared to that seen following wild type Salmonella infection in both the cecum ( Fig 5C ) and ileum ( Fig 5D ) . Histochemical analysis of H&E-stained cecal sections showed that preventing AIEC expansion mitigated the tissue pathology compared to mice in which wild type AIEC blooms were present ( Fig 5E and 5F ) . In mice colonized with AIEC \u0394PI-6 , crypt architecture and goblet cells were largely intact and there were fewer necrotic cells in the lumen . Also , when S . tmAvir was used for the secondary infection in AIEC-colonized mice there was a significant reduction in immunopathology ( Fig 5F ) , a blunted TNF\u03b1 release from explanted cecal tissue ( Fig 5G ) , and a significant reduction in fecal lipocalin-2 output ( Fig 5H ) . In addition to Salmonella gastroenteritis being a risk factor for new onset CD [18] , enteropathogenic E . coli ( EPEC ) has been associated with both first onset IBD [16 , 17 , 35] and relapsing disease requiring surgical intervention [23 , 24] . The Citrobacter rodentium murine model of infectious colitis , resembling the disease course of EPEC in humans , is well established [36] . The disease course in C57BL/6 mice is acute and self-limiting , providing an opportunity to validate our findings on AIEC potentiation in a secondary co-infection model . To test this we colonized groups of C57BL/6 mice with AIEC , which , in contrast to 129e mice that are colonized for the lifetime of the animal , are colonized transiently with AIEC over a 3\u20134 week timeframe [25] . Infectious colitis was initiated 7 days after AIEC colonization by secondary exposure to C . rodentium ( Fig 6A ) , and bacterial loads in the feces , cecum and colon were tracked over the next 36 days . Both AIEC-na\u00efve and AIEC-colonized C57BL/6 mice cleared C . rodentium infection in a reproducible fashion by day 21 , indicating that resident AIEC did not alter host immunity towards C . rodentium ( Fig 6B ) . Similar to what we observed in previous studies , C57BL/6 mice monocolonized with AIEC cleared the bacteria around day 25 ( Fig 6C ) . In contrast , C . rodentium infection caused an outgrowth of AIEC , which was detectable in the feces beginning ~ 4 days after C . rodentium infection and reaching significance by day 10 and thereafter until day 36 when the experiment was stopped ( Fig 6C ) . Interestingly , this AIEC expansion persisted into the post-infectious period after C . rodentium was cleared , and lasted well after monocolonized mice typically clear AIEC , indicating that infectious colitis prevents normal convalescence from AIEC colonization in this host background . C . rodentium infection initiates in the cecum and progresses to the colon . These sites are the primary targets of host inflammation whereas the small intestine is generally neither colonized nor inflamed by C . rodentium [37] . We measured the tissue-associated AIEC loads at these sites and found a significant AIEC bloom in the cecum at day 21 , and in the colon at both day 14 and 21 after C . rodentium infection ( Fig 6D and 6E ) . C . rodentium levels in the colon peak 10 days after infection , followed by the onset of peak inflammation at day 14 when pathology is maximal . Histological analyses of H&E-stained colonic sections showed that by day 14 , C . rodentium had induced colon pathology in both AIEC-colonized and AIEC-na\u00efve hosts ( Fig 7A ) . This early pathology was primarily driven by C . rodentium because the degree of pathology was similar in both infection groups ( Fig 7B ) . By day 21 , the pathogenic features in C . rodentium monocolonized mice were largely normalized , however significant pathological features persisted on day 21 in AIEC-colonized mice exposed to C . rodentium despite the fact that C . rodentium had been cleared by this time point . The surface epithelium and mucosa were the main sites of persistent host damage , and to a lesser extent the sub-mucosa ( Fig 7C ) , indicating that AIEC potentiated tissue damage in the post-infectious period . C . rodentium induces transient crypt hyperplasia and goblet cell depletion in the colon that begins to normalize following the peak inflammatory period as the pathogen is cleared by ~ day 21 [36 , 38] . On day 14 , both infection groups exposed to C . rodentium had significant crypt hyperplasia ( Fig 7D ) and goblet cell depletion ( Fig 7E ) compared to mice singly colonized with AIEC . However on day 21 , a time point at which C . rodentium had been cleared and the crypt length and goblet cell phenotype had normalized in mice singly infected with C . rodentium ( Fig 7D and 7E ) , mice harbouring AIEC prior to infectious colitis had a significant defect in mucosal reconstitution , displaying persistent crypt hyperplasia and a sustained defect in goblet cell numbers ( Fig 7D and 7E ) . Given the high AIEC expansion in the colon at this time point , these findings indicated that AIEC drives intestinal pathology and delayed mucosal epithelial restitution in the post-infectious period following infectious colitis . \n Despite decades of research , a unifying etiologic pathway to CD has been elusive . Genome-wide association studies have now revealed close to 200 IBD susceptibility alleles . However , in aggregate these loci account for only ~30% of CD heritability with a dominant contribution of three common NOD2 variants [39] . The discordance rate of CD among monozygotic twins also highlights the importance of environmental factors in disease pathogenesis [30] . Thus , while genetic susceptibility remains a key consideration for risk assessment it must be considered among a constellation of other additive risk factors . Recent attention has turned towards a \u2018multi-hit\u2019 model of CD pathogenesis that reflects this conceptual framework [19] . In this model the cumulative effects of several factors presents a \u2018tipping point\u2019 between homeostasis and protracted intestinal inflammation , a concept that was recently validated in a mouse model involving a genetic TLR1 deficiency [40] . Another risk factor in this multi-hit framework is acute infectious gastroenteritis caused by exposure to relatively common zoonotic pathogens [16\u201318] . Although such infections tend to be self-limiting , these episodes confer long-term risk of CD well into the post-infectious period , suggesting a sustained imbalance of intestinal homeostasis . Given that healthy subjects can carry AIEC as part of the microbial composition in their gut [41] , one possibility is that infectious gastroenteritis elicits the pathogenic character of quiescent AIEC that subsequently exacerbates host damage . Indeed , our report suggests that Crohn\u2019s-associated AIEC exploit the unique host environment imprinted by the action of pathogenic microbes that have been linked to short- and long-term risk of IBD . AIEC expansion and host damage following S . Typhimurium gastroenteritis required the resistance of AIEC to host defense peptides . One of the first CD susceptibility genes was NOD2/CARD15 , in which loss-of-function mutations increase the risk of disease [42 , 43] . Early studies reported that loss of NOD2 signaling produced defects in the manufacture of some human defensins by Paneth cells and offered a mechanism to account for the altered microbial composition in CD . However these data have been challenged based on human [44 , 45] and better-controlled mouse studies [46] that show antimicrobial peptide production by Paneth cells appears to be independent of NOD2 status . This is more in keeping with observations that many antimicrobial peptides are instead increased in inflamed Crohn\u2019s lesions [47 , 48] . It also implies that bacteria living at the mucosal surface with an active role in Crohn\u2019s pathogenesis would require mechanisms to resist antimicrobial peptides in the inflamed gut , at least in some patients . Indeed , we found that when AIEC were rendered susceptible to host defense peptides they could no longer expand following infectious gastroenteritis and produced moderating effects on disease severity . Previous work found that , among AIEC isolates from IBD patients that were phenotypically resistant to antimicrobial peptides ( MIC >8 \u03bcg/ml ) , many of these strains contained at least one resistance gene from the arlABC locus [34] . Interestingly , none of the E . coli isolated from healthy subjects were resistant to host defense peptides , suggesting that the host might imprint a selective pressure for the evolution of such traits . Whether this selective host environment arises as a result of genetics , the endogenous microbiota , or even xenobiotics used in the management of CD remains an open question . The fact that AIEC are genetically diverse [12] suggests that a number of different founder populations are capable of giving rise to this pathobiont type and understanding what shapes this evolutionary trajectory will be an important topic for future studies . The effect of infectious gastroenteritis on eliciting the pathobiont characteristics of AIEC is consistent with other inflammation models using either chemical colitis or host genetic deficiencies . For example , mouse colon injured by the sodium salt of dextran sulfate produces pan-colitis that is further aggravated by AIEC strain LF82 [49 , 50] . A genetic deficiency model using TLR5-/- mice that can develop spontaneous colitis showed that transient colonization by AIEC strain LF82 promoted the development of a colitic microbiota that persisted after AIEC was cleared by the host [51 , 52] . At this time , we cannot rule out wholesale changes in the microbiota of our co-infection model in favor of a more proinflammatory composition , however our data suggests this is not the main driver . The expansion of tissue-associated AIEC and its direct correlation with pathological outcomes in our study is consistent with human studies showing that the severity of ileal CD is directly correlated with the tissue-associated E . coli burden [3\u20135] . Thus , if global changes in the microbiota are present , it does not alter the disease course in the absence of AIEC expansion . In summary , exposure to pathogens that trigger acute gastroenteritis creates an environment favorable to colonization by AIEC in otherwise uncontrived hosts . AIEC can be detected in a proportion of healthy individuals , which bears relevance to the finding that infectious gastroenteritis in the general population is a risk factor for IBD . This work provides rationale for the development of novel diagnostic methods that could help identify AIEC-colonized individuals who may be at greater risk following an episode of acute gastroenteritis . It is also possible that infectious gastroenteritis in humans renders them more susceptible to de novo acquisition of AIEC through vulnerabilities created by the disruption of the resident microbiota , a loss of so-called colonization resistance . If so , efforts to understand the provenance of AIEC and its transmission mechanisms should be intensified . Finally , the often long prodromal period for CD [53] and the observed latency between recovery from acute gastroenteritis and CD onset may create intervention opportunities to mitigate or neutralize disease risk in a subset of individuals . \n Animal experiments were conducted according to guidelines set by the Canadian Council on Animal Care using protocols approved by the Animal Review Ethics Board at McMaster University under Animal Use Protocol #13-07-20 . AIEC strain NRG857c ( serotype O83:H1 ) was isolated from an ileal tissue biopsy from a CD patient in Charite Hospital ( Berlin , Germany ) and its genome sequence was determined previously [10 , 54] . A mutant that is sensitized to the action of host defense peptides by deletion of the genes arlABC ( NRG857c \u0394PI6 ) was characterized previously [34] . NRG857c and \u0394PI-6 were cultured in Luria-Bertani ( LB ) broth containing chloramphenicol ( 34 \u03bcg/mL ) and ampicillin ( 100 \u03bcg/mL ) . Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium strain SL1344 was cultured in LB broth containing 50 \u03bcg/ml streptomycin . Escherichia coli K-12 strain MG1655 was cultured in LB broth with 50 \u03bcg/ml rifampicin . Citrobacter rodentium strain DBS100 was cultured in LB broth with no antibiotics . For mouse infections , AIEC was grown for 16\u201318 h at 37\u00b0C with shaking , washed , diluted , and resuspended in phosphate buffered saline ( PBS ) . Prior to infection experiments S . Typhimurium was resuspended in HEPES buffer ( pH 8 . 0 ) , 0 . 9% NaCl . Eight- to ten-week-old female 129e and C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Charles River Laboratories . Animals were housed in a specific pathogen-free barrier unit under Level 2 conditions at the Central Animal Facility at McMaster University . 129e mice were given 20 mg of streptomycin by orogastric gavage 24 h before infection with 2 x 109 colony forming units ( cfu ) of AIEC NRG857c . Control groups remained AIEC na\u00efve by gavage with sterile PBS . Two weeks later , AIEC-colonized and control mice were infected with 0 . 8 x 108 cfu of S . Typhimurium . In the C . rodentium model , C57BL/6 mice were challenged with 2 x 108 cfu of C . rodentium at 1-week post-AIEC infection . Control groups received an equal volume of sterile PBS . AIEC and the secondary acute pathogen were measured in fecal output . At various time points after secondary infections , tissue-associated bacteria were enumerated in the cecum , colon and ileum . Tissues were harvested into cold PBS at necropsy and flushed with PBS . Samples were homogenized ( Retsch ) , serially diluted in PBS , and plated on LB agar containing either chloramphenicol and ampicillin to select for AIEC NRG857c; rifampicin to select for K-12; Brilliant green ( BG ) agar with no antibiotics to select for C . rodentium; or BG containing streptomycin to select S . Typhimurium . After 24 h of incubation at 37\u00b0C , colonies were counted and expressed as cfu per gram of tissue . At various time points after secondary infection , sections of the cecal tip , distal colon or ileum were collected and fixed in buffered 10% formalin for 72 h , paraffin-embedded , sectioned into 5-\u03bcm slices and then stained with haematoxylin and eosin ( H&E ) by Histology Services ( McMaster University , Hamilton , ON ) . In some experiments tissues were flash frozen in optimal cutting template compound ( OCT; Sakura , Fisher ) for immunohistochemical analysis . A minimum of 5 views per section were analyzed for each sample and scored according to previously defined criteria summarized in S1 Table [25] . Crypt length measurements and goblet cell quantification was done using ImageJ software on a Leica HC microscope with at least five well-oriented crypts measured per field . Immunohistochemical staining of formalin- and OCT- fixed tissue sections were performed using antibodies against F4/80 ( 1:600 ) , CD3 ( 1:1000 ) and GR1 ( 1:500 ) at the Histology Services . Quantification was done on six to eight views per section with at least six formalin-fixed sections per group . Tissues removed at necropsy on day 5 following infection with the secondary pathogen were washed with cRPMI ( 10% fetal bovine serum , 1% L-glutamine and 50 \u03bcg/mL gentamicin ) , cut into pieces , placed in 1 mL of cRPMI and incubated overnight at 37\u00b0C , 5% CO2 . Supernatants were removed after incubation and levels of cytokines and chemokines were determined using the Mouse 32-Plex Discovery Assay by Eve Technologies ( Calgary , AB ) or Quantikine murine ELISA kits from R&D systems ( Minneapolis , MN ) . To measure intestinal permeability , mice were gavaged with 150 \u03bcl of 80 mg/ml FITC dextran ( 4kDa ) in PBS 4 h prior to sacrifice . Blood was collected by cardiac puncture or tail bleed into 15% v/v acid-citrate- dextrose . Plasma was collected by centrifugation and fluorescence was measured at 530 nm with excitation at 485 nm . Nitrite concentration in cecal supernatants was determined in a 96-well microplate by adding 50 \u03bcl of supernatants to 50 \u03bcl of Greiss reagent ( Sigma-Aldrich ) following incubation for at least 10 min in the dark as described in the manufacturer\u2019s protocol . The absorbance ( A550 ) was measured and the concentration was determined from a standard curve . Fecal pellets were collected , weighed , homogenized in PBS using a Mixer Mill and then centrifuged at 13 , 000 rpm for 5 min . Following centrifugation , supernatants were removed and levels of lipocalin were determined using a Quantikine murine ELISA kit from R&D systems ( Minneapolis , MN ) . Mann-Whitney or one-way ANOVA with Tukey or Dunnett post-test was performed using a 95% confidence interval to determine difference among infection groups . Kaplan-Meier survival curves were analyzed with the log rank test . All analyses were performed using Graph Prism 5 . 0 ( GraphPad Software Inc . San Diego , CA ) . A P value of 0 . 05 or less was considered significant .", "headings": ["Abstract", "Introduction", "Results", "Discussion", "Methods"], "keywords": ["medicine and health sciences", "pathology and laboratory medicine", "pathogens", "microbiology", "salmonellosis", "bacterial diseases", "enterobacteriaceae", "gastroenterology and hepatology", "inflammatory bowel disease", "bacteria", "bacterial pathogens", "salmonella typhimurium", "digestive system", "infectious diseases", "escherichia coli infections", "gastroenteritis", "medical microbiology", "microbial pathogens", "salmonella", "gastrointestinal tract", "anatomy", "biology and life sciences", "organisms", "cecum"], "id": "journal.ppat.1005907"}
{"lay_summary": "The selection and specification of the egg cell determine the number of eggs produced by an animal or plant , which in turn dictates how many offspring that organism can produce . In most higher plants , the egg cell forms in a specialized structure consisting of four different cell types . Two cells , the egg cell and the central cell , are fertilized by sperm cells and develop into the embryo proper and the nutritive tissue ( endosperm ) , respectively . These two gametic cells are flanked by accessory cells; but why do some cells become gametic while others differentiate into accessory cells ? To answer this question , we looked for mutants in which this process is disturbed . In the lachesis mutant , accessory cells become extra egg cells . Interestingly , it seems that the misspecification of these accessory cells results from defects in the gametic cells . This suggests that accessory cells monitor the state of the gametic cells to act as a backup if required , ensuring the formation of the key reproductive cells .", "article": "In flowering plants , the egg and sperm cells form within haploid gametophytes . The female gametophyte of Arabidopsis consists of two gametic cells , the egg cell and the central cell , which are flanked by five accessory cells . Both gametic and accessory cells are vital for fertilization; however , the mechanisms that underlie the formation of accessory versus gametic cell fate are unknown . In a screen for regulators of egg cell fate , we isolated the lachesis ( lis ) mutant which forms supernumerary egg cells . In lis mutants , accessory cells differentiate gametic cell fate , indicating that LIS is involved in a mechanism that prevents accessory cells from adopting gametic cell fate . The temporal and spatial pattern of LIS expression suggests that this mechanism is generated in gametic cells . LIS is homologous to the yeast splicing factor PRP4 , indicating that components of the splice apparatus participate in cell fate decisions . \n The formation of gametes is a key step in the lifecycle of any sexually reproducing organism . In flowering plants , the egg and sperm cells develop within haploid gametophytes ( Figure 1 ) . The female gametophyte of Arabidopsis originates from a single haploid spore ( Figure 1A ) through three nuclear division cycles . The resulting syncytium of eight nuclei ( Figure 1B ) cellularizes and differentiates four distinct cell fates [1\u20134] ( Figure 1C and 1D ) . Both the egg and central cells are fertilized by one sperm cell each to form the embryo and the surrounding endosperm , respectively . These gametic cells are flanked by accessory cells . Two synergids lie at the micropylar pole , the entry point of the pollen tube . Synergids are necessary for the attraction of the pollen tube and induce the subsequent release of the sperm cells [5\u20137] . The opposite pole is occupied by three antipodal cells that degenerate prior to fertilization and whose function is unclear [3] . Although collections of female gametophytic mutants have been reported [8 , 9] , mechanisms that underlie the specification of gametic versus accessory cell fate are unknown . In the present study , we took advantage of an egg cell\u2013specific marker that we isolated in a screen for enhancer detector ( ET ) and gene trap ( GT ) lines , to examine the regulation of gametic cell fate . Our results indicate that a combinatorial mechanism operates to ensure maximum likelihood that the key reproductive gametic cells are formed , while at the same time deleterious excess gametic cell formation is prevented . \n We performed a screen for ethyl methanesulfonate ( EMS ) -induced mutants that alter the expression of the enhancer detector line ET1119 , which in wild type confers specific \u03b2-glucuronidase ( GUS ) expression to the egg cell ( Figure 2A ) . In lachesis-1 ( lis-1 ) mutants , expression of the egg cell marker was expanded to the synergids and the central cell , suggesting that the restriction of egg cell fate to a single cell is compromised ( Figure 2B and 2C ) . lis-1 is a loss-of-function mutation for which no homozygous plants were recovered ( see below ) . Therefore , all analyses were performed on heterozygous plants in which only 50% of the ovules contain lis-1 mutant female gametophytes . Heterozygous lis-1/LIS plants produced fertilized seeds and aborted ovules at a 1:1 ratio ( 50 . 7%:49 . 3% in lis-1/LIS , n = 631; 96 . 6%:3 . 4% in wild type , n = 655; Figure 1E and 1F ) , consistent with a female gametophytic defect [10] . Reciprocal crosses with wild-type plants confirmed that lis-1 was rarely transmitted maternally ( transmission efficiency through the female [TEF] = 8 . 6% , n = 347 ) . Paternal transmission was also affected , but less severely ( transmission efficiency through the male [TEM] = 59 . 4% , n = 367 ) . To determine whether lis-1 female gametophytes are indeed defective in cell specification , we examined morphological , molecular , and functional characteristics of the different cell types in lis-1 gametophytes ( Figures 1 , 2 , and 3 , respectively ) . Until cellularization , gametophytes were indistinguishable between lis-1/LIS and wild-type plants ( unpublished data ) , indicating that LIS is not required for any previous step , including mitotic divisions , migration of nuclei , or cellularization . The first defects in lis-1 female gametophytes were consistently observed only after cellularization , corresponding to the wild-type stage at which the different cell types establish distinct morphological and molecular characteristics , as described below . Wild-type synergids differ morphologically from egg cells by two features . First , the synergid nuclei are smaller than the egg cell nucleus . Second , the polarity of synergids is reversed with respect to nuclear position [11 , 12] ( Figure 1G ) . In lis-1/LIS plants , however , synergids differentiated the morphological attributes of egg cell fate and were often indistinguishable from egg cells ( Figure 1J; Table 1 ) . Additionally , the expression of the synergid marker ET2634 was down-regulated in many lis-1 gametophytes ( Figure 2D\u20132F ) . To test whether the pollen tube\u2013attracting activity of synergids was affected as well , we pollinated lis-1/LIS and wild-type plants with a marker line expressing GUS in the pollen tube ( ET434G ) ( Figure 3A ) . The number of ovules without GUS staining was strongly increased in lis-1/LIS plants as compared to wild type ( Figure 3A\u20133C ) , implying that pollen tube attraction was compromised in the majority of lis-1 mutant female gametophytes . These data , together with the ectopic expression of the egg cell marker in the synergids , indicate that lis-1 mutant synergids differentiate egg cell attributes at the expense of synergid cell fate . A different synergid marker ( ET884 ) was ectopically expressed in lis-1 gametophytes ( Figure 2G\u20132I ) . This intriguing expression shows that not all aspects of accessory and gametic cell fate are mutually exclusive . However , the reduced pollen tube attraction in lis-1 indicates that this marker is unlikely to reflect fully differentiated synergid cell fate . The central cell differs from the egg cell by both its size and the presence of two polar nuclei , which fuse prior to fertilization [1\u20134] ( Figure 1H ) . In lis-1 mutant gametophytes , the polar nuclei rarely fused and often cellularized separately , a process never observed in wild type ( Figure 1K and 1M; Table 1 ) . The resulting uninucleate cells were morphologically indistinguishable from an egg cell . These morphological changes were reflected by the down-regulation of a central cell marker pMEA::GUS in most lis-1 gametophytes ( Figure 2J\u20132L ) . Whereas the wild-type central cell develops into endosperm after fertilization , approximately one half of the lis-1 mutant gametophytes that received a pollen tube ( compare Figure 3C ) failed to develop endosperm ( Figure 3D\u20133F ) although embryo formation was not affected . The failure to develop endosperm is unlikely to be related to an unfertilized central cell , because embryo formation can initiate autonomous endosperm formation in an unfertilized central cell [13] . Together with the ectopic expression of the egg cell marker , our results indicate that in lis-1 gametophytes , the central cell differentiates egg cell attributes at the expense of central cell fate . A further striking phenotype was observed for the antipodal cells that degenerate prior to fertilization in wild type ( Figure 1I ) . In lis-1 female gametophytes , the antipodal cells were often enlarged and protruded into the center ( Figure 1L and 1M; Table 1 ) . Additionally , in about one third of lis-1 gametophytes ( 16 . 9% in lis-1/LIS ) , the enlarged antipodal cells eventually disintegrated their cell membranes , allowing the fusion of antipodal nuclei into one large nucleus ( Figure 1N ) . In wild-type gametophytes , fusion of nuclei was only detected in central cells ( Table 1 ) . Consistently , we observed ectopic expression of the central cell marker pMEA::GUS in the protruding antipodal cells ( Figure 2M\u20132O ) , whereas the expression of GT3733 , an antipodal marker line , was down-regulated ( Figure 2P\u20132R ) . Thus , antipodal cells in lis-1 mutant female gametophytes can adopt a central cell fate . Remarkably , both the central cells and antipodal cells changed not only their molecular profile according to the newly adopted cell fate , but they also adjusted their nuclear status ( uninucleate versus binucleate ) accordingly . The originally binucleate central cell cellularized ectopically , resulting in two uninucleate cells , whereas the uninucleate antipodal cells fused , producing a binucleate cell . These findings suggest that an intracellular signaling mechanism senses the number of nuclei in a given cell , and reveal a tremendous , previously unrecognized plasticity of the female gametophyte . In summary , whereas wild-type gametophytes differentiate accessory and gametic cell types , accessory cells of lis-1 mutant gametophytes frequently adopted gametic cell fate . These observations suggest that all cells in the female gametophyte are competent to differentiate gametic cell fate and that LIS is involved in a mechanism that represses gametic cell fate in the accessory cells . Interestingly , the gametic central cell in lis-1 gametophytes additionally adopted egg cell fate , suggesting that a further , LIS-dependent mechanism suppresses egg cell fate in the central cell . Thus , the lis-1 mutant phenotype reveals two levels of cell fate regulation , one between gametic and accessory cells , and one between egg and central cell . The late initiation of cell-specific marker genes indicates that in Arabidopsis distinct cell fates are only manifested after cellularization . Studies in several multicellular systems have shown that cell specification is often preceded by the asymmetric distribution of fate determinants ( for review see [14] ) , and an analogous mechanism could be defective in lis-1 gametophytes , resulting in an instant misspecification of accessory cells . Alternatively , the lis-1 phenotype could result from defects that occur after cellularization when distinct cell fates become manifest . We analyzed the time course of egg cell and central cell marker gene expression . Interestingly , we found that the number of ovules that ectopically expressed gametic cell fate increased over time ( Figure 4A and 4B ) , indicating that accessory cells are not instantly misspecified as gametic cells . In line with a successive misspecification of accessory cells , we found that several morphological features that distinguish lis-1/LIS plants from wild type became more pronounced over time ( Figure 4C\u20134G ) . Our results suggest that during cell specification in lis-1 mutant gametophytes , accessory cells become gradually recruited as gametic cells . We mapped the lis-1 mutation to the At2g41500 locus , which encodes a protein with seven WD40 repeats . The lis-1 mutation creates an in-frame stop codon after three WD40 repeats ( Figure 5A ) . The LIS cDNA driven by a 2 . 6-kilobase ( kb ) upstream promoter sequence complemented the lis mutant phenotype ( Figure 5B and 5C ) , indicating that lis-1 is a loss-of-function mutation . The LIS protein is strongly conserved among eukaryotes [15] ( Figure S1 ) , showing an overall similarity to Homo sapiens , Caenorhabditis elegans , and Saccharomyces cerevisiae of 62% , 56% , and 54% , respectively . The yeast homolog PRP4 is associated with the U4/U6 complex of the spliceosome [16 , 17] . PRP4 is an essential splicing factor , and loss-of-function mutants accumulate unspliced pre-mRNA [18] . PRP4 function depends on its interaction with a second splicing factor , PRP3 , through its WD40 domain , and the deletion of two WD40 repeats abolishes this interaction [19] . We thus conclude that lis-1 represents the null phenotype , which is consistent with the observation that the lis-2 T-DNA insertion allele ( Figure 5A ) causes a very similar phenotype ( Figure S2 ) . The Arabidopsis genome contains a second LIS-related sequence , At2g05720 . The deduced protein ( accession no . AAD25639; Figure S1 ) shares an overall similarity of 70% , but is only half the size of the LIS protein and notably contains only four complete WD40 repeats ( Figure S1 ) . Hence , At2g05720 is unlikely to be functionally redundant to LIS . To determine the temporal and spatial expression pattern of the LIS gene , we performed RT-PCR and analyzed the expression of a pLIS::NLS_GUS construct containing the same LIS promoter fragment as the LIS cDNA rescue construct that had fully complemented the mutant phenotype ( Figure 5B and 5C ) . LIS expression was detected at moderate levels in all tissues examined , with strongest expression in reproductive tissues ( Figure 6A ) . GUS expression driven by the LIS promoter was detected at all stages of female gametophyte development ( Figure 6B\u20136E ) . Intriguingly , shortly after cellularization , expression in the accessory cells is down-regulated , whereas expression in the gametic cells is strongly up-regulated ( Figure 6E ) . This suggests that the mechanism , which prevents accessory cells from adopting gametic cell fate , is not cell-autonomous , but is generated in gametic cells , which is consistent with a lateral inhibition model ( Figure 6F ) . We propose that the gametic cells upon differentiation generate a LIS-dependent signaling molecule that is transmitted to the adjacent accessory cells to inhibit their gametic cell competence , thereby preventing excess gametic cell formation . In this view , the lis mutant phenotype is a result of impaired lateral inhibition , i . e . , the gametic cells fail to identify themselves to their neighboring cells , resulting in the recruitment of all gametophytic cells as gametic cells . The observation that not all cells are synchronously specified as gametic cells implies some initial bias and suggests that the proposed lateral inhibition operates to maintain rather than to establish different cell fates . Although this mechanism can perpetuate a binary decision between gametic and accessory cell fate , additional factors are needed to explain the generation of four distinct cell fates . The surprising nature of the LIS protein as a splicing factor suggests the participation of components of the splicing machinery in cell fate decisions and , potentially , the generation of a lateral inhibition signal . A possible mode of action could be that LIS is involved in splicing this very signal or , much less direct , some upstream regulator . Our data suggest that a combinatorial mechanism operates to pattern the female gametophyte: The competence of all cells to differentiate gametic cell fate , together with lateral inhibition from the gametic cells , can ensure maximum likelihood that the key reproductive gametic cells are formed , while at the same time , excess gametic cell formation is prevented . Both the expression of the LIS gene and its distinct function in regulating gametic cell fate are surprising , given that LIS is the Arabidopsis homolog of yPRP4 , an integral part of the U4/U6 complex . In the future , identification of LIS target ( s ) and functional analyses of other tissue-specific splicing factors [20] will help to clarify the mechanistic role of the spliceosome in the regulation of distinct developmental processes . \n Plants were grown on soil in growth chambers under long-day conditions at 18 \u00b0C . Enhancer detector and gene trap lines were generated using the system of Sundaresan and colleagues [21] . ( Send requests for ET and GT lines to UG , grossnik@botinst . unizh . ch . ) The lis-1 allele was isolated from ET1119 in the Landsberg erecta ( Ler ) accession after mutagenesis; seeds were mutagenized by incubation in 0 . 15% EMS for 10 h . A total of 5 , 200 M1 plants were screened for deviating GUS expression in the female gametophyte . The lis-2 allele ( SALK_070009 ) was obtained from the SALK T-DNA insertion collection ( http://signal . salk . edu ) . For the pMEA::GUS reporter construct , a gift from D . Page , a 1 . 6-kb promoter fragment ( upstream of the ATG of MEDEA ) was cloned into pCAMBIA1381z using EcoRI/NcoI restriction sites . Mapping of lis-1 was done as described [22] using the polymorphisms annotated by CEREON [23] . The Columbia accession ( Col ) was used as a crossing partner . lis-1 was located to Chromosome 2 in an area of 126 kb between the polymorphisms CER448978 and CER446310 on BACs F13H10 and T32G6 , respectively . We amplified and sequenced lis-1/LIS genomic DNA spanning 15 open reading frames and identified a single heterozygous locus in At2g41500 . The LIS cDNA was isolated according to the annotated open reading frame from a cDNA library using primer 5\u2032-GATTGAGGATCCATGGAACCCAACAAGGAT-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-GATTGAGGATCCAAACAAAGTTCATTCATTTGC-3\u2032 and cloned into pDRIVE ( Qiagen , Hilden , Germany ) . The cDNA was released as an XhoI/KpnI fragment , and cloned into pMDC134 ( M . D . Curtis , unpublished data ) . Upstream of the cDNA , a Gateway recombination site ( Invitrogen , Karlsruhe , Germany ) was introduced using the XhoI/SacI sites . The LIS promoter region was amplified by PCR from genomic DNA using primers 5\u2032-AAGAAACAGCCAAATAGATAAGCA-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-GTTTCCCTTAAATCCTCAAAAGAAAACACC-3\u2032 and cloned into pENTR 1A ( Invitrogen ) to generate a Gateway compatible promoter fragment . This promoter fragment was cloned upstream of the LIS cDNA via Gateway recombination .

The resulting 264 base pair ( bp ) fragment was digested with BfmI yielding two fragments of 244 bp and 20 bp from the product of the lis-1 allele , whereas the wild-type product is not digested . Total RNA was isolated from wild-type tissues using the E . Z . N . A . Plant RNA Kit ( Peqlab Biotechnologie , Erlangen , Germany ) . Ten micrograms of total RNA were used for mRNA-isolation via Dynabeads mRNA DIRECT Micro Kit ( Invitrogen ) . Superscript II ( Invitrogen ) was used for reverse transcription . Intron-spanning primers were used for PCR to prevent the amplifica-tion of genomic DNA . LIS cDNA was amplified using: 5\u2032-CACTGCCTCATACGACATGAAAGTC-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-ACGAGCTATCTGCTGTGATATCTAGAG-3\u2032 . ACTIN2 was amplified using 5\u2032-CCTGAAAGGAAGTACAGTG-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-CTGTGAACGATTCCTGGAC-3\u2032 . To generate the pLIS::NLS_GUS construct , the LIS promoter region was amplified by PCR from genomic DNA using primer 5\u2032-AAGAAACAGCCAAATAGATAAGCA-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-GTTTCCCTTAAATCCTCAAAAGAAAACACC-3\u2032 , and cloned into pDRIVE . The 2 . 6-kb LIS promoter fragment was isolated by BamHI/XhoI digestion , and ligated into the binary vector pGIIBAR-EcoRV/XhoI . A GUS construct with N-terminal nuclear localization site [24] was inserted downstream of the promoter . For analysis of mature gametophytes , the oldest closed flower bud of a given inflorescence was emasculated and harvested two days later . Cytochemical staining for GUS activity was performed as described [25] , without additional clearing of the tissue prior to observation . Whole-mount mature gametophytes were prepared as described by Yadegari et al . [26] . For whole-mount embryos , siliques were dissected and cleared with chloral hydrate:glycerol:water-solution 8:3:1 ( w:v:v ) without prior fixation .

{"lay_summary": "Consistently wearing shoes may help in preventing onset or progression of a wide range of Neglected Tropical Diseases ( NTDs ) . This study assessed the factors that influenced shoe wearing behaviors among people living in a rural community in highland Ethiopia . In this community , a substantial proportion of people are at risk for podoconiosis , a debilitating lower leg condition that can be prevented by wearing shoes . We conducted semi-structured individual interviews , focus group discussions and extended case studies among 242 adults and systematically analyzed the information . We found that shoe wearing is intermittent , and that different factors such as cost and ability to use the shoes for certain activities ( such as farming ) influenced consistent shoe wearing for most people . Some factors ( such as shoe size , fear of stigma ) were more relevant for podoconiosis patients . Social norms were found to be increasingly supportive of shoe wearing , and children exhibited greater desire to wear shoes than adults . These findings have relevance for preventing development and progression of a variety of NTDs in a range of settings .", "article": "The role of footwear in protection against a range of Neglected Tropical Diseases ( NTDs ) is gaining increasing attention . Better understanding of the behaviors that influence use of footwear will lead to improved ability to measure shoe use and will be important for those implementing footwear programs . Using the PRECEDE-PROCEED model we assessed social , behavioral , environmental , educational and ecological needs influencing whether and when children wear shoes in a rural highland Ethiopian community endemic for podoconiosis . Information was gathered from 242 respondents using focus groups , semi-structured interviews and extended case studies . Shoe-wearing norms were said to be changing , with going barefoot increasingly seen as \u2018shameful\u2019 . Shoes were thought to confer dignity as well as protection against injury and cold . However , many practical and social barriers prevented the desire to wear shoes from being translated into practice . Limited financial resources meant that people were neither able to purchase more than one pair of shoes to ensure their longevity nor afford shoes of the preferred quality . As a result of this limited access , shoes were typically preserved for special occasions and might not be provided for children until they reached a certain age . While some barriers ( for example fit of shoe and fear of labeling through use of a certain type of shoe ) may be applicable only to certain diseases , underlying structural level barriers related to poverty ( for example price , quality , unsuitability for daily activities and low risk perception ) are likely to be relevant to a range of NTDs . Using well established conceptual models of health behavior adoption , we identified several barriers to shoe wearing that are amenable to intervention and which we anticipate will be of benefit to those considering NTD prevention through shoe distribution . \n Interest is growing in the use of footwear in the primary prevention of certain Neglected Tropical Diseases ( NTDs ) . While evidence for a protective role of footwear against podoconiosis [1]\u2013[3] and chronic larva migrans [4] , [5] is relatively strong , evidence for the role of shoes is inconsistent in relation to hookworm , with some studies finding evidence of protection from footwear [6] , [7] , but other studies finding no effect [8]\u2013[11] . Evidence is also inconsistent for other helminthiases [10] , [12]\u2013[15] and Buruli ulcer [16] , [17] . For snakebite and tungiasis , evidence of protection is circumstantial , and based on the predilection of bites [18] and lesions [19] for the feet . While research on the impact of behaviors such as hand-washing [20] , face-washing [21] and use of disease-preventing commodities such as insecticide-treated bed nets ( ITNs , [22] ) is relatively advanced , there is a paucity of research on behaviors related to footwear and their impact on NTDs . While conducting work on the use of shoes in a rural Ethiopian community endemic for podoconiosis ( a NTD triggered by exposure to irritant soils in the tropical highlands [3] , [23] ) , we uncovered considerable information on behaviors and practices relating to shoe use which is relevant to a range of other NTDs . In brief , in southern Ethiopia , shoes are being distributed through a local non-governmental organization to children with the intention of preventing podoconiosis . This non-communicable form of elephantiasis arises from long-term exposure to red clay soils . Ecological and observational evidence suggests that consistent use of shoes prevents disease by protection from soil exposure . Shoe distribution to children of treated patients has been accompanied by messages linking foot hygiene and shoe use to reduced risk of disease . Program implementers considered it vital to understand why children might or might not wear shoes , in order to improve the messaging that might be used alongside distribution . To this end , we drew on several conceptual models to guide our efforts . First , we relied on the PRECEDE-PROCEED model that suggests beginning the process with diagnostic planning to assess social , behavioral , environmental , educational and ecological issues and needs that may influence whether and when children wear shoes [24] . We also considered social cognitive theory of self regulation [25] . Taken together these theories argue for the importance of targeting individuals' beliefs and attitudes about shoe wearing , how these beliefs influence perceived capabilities to prevent podoconiosis , and whether wearing shoes can be effective in reducing their risk for the condition . The data presented in this article arise from a qualitative study aimed to gain deeper understanding of the barriers to consistent use of shoes in a rural setting . We anticipate that this information will be valuable both for investigators designing future studies to assess the association between shoe use and incidence of NTDs , and for those developing shoe-related prevention programs . \n Ethical approval was granted by the Institutional Review Boards of Addis Ababa University Medical Faculty and the National Human Genome Research Institute , National Institutes of Health , USA . Oral consent was obtained from all study participants by a trained research assistant , following the procedures developed and evaluated by Tekola and colleagues using Rapid Ethical Assessment in this community [26] . In brief , Rapid Ethical Assessment is a form of rapid anthropological assessment performed to explore a community's understanding of research , to document how a community prefers to be approached by investigators and to detail how community members wish consent to be given . Rural communities in Wolaita prefer contact through a Mossy Foot Treatment and Prevention Association ( MFTPA ) staff member prior to individual discussion and consent . The Mossy Foot Treatment and Prevention Association is a local non-governmental organization involved in the prevention and treatment of podoconiosis patients and shoe distribution for their children . Oral consent is preferred by this community [26] , was approved by the IRBs mentioned above and was documented by a witness on each occasion following an explanation of the research protocol using the information sheet and consent form . The study was conducted in Wolaita zone in southern Ethiopia , where the population is estimated to be 1 . 7 million [27] . Podoconiosis is known to be prevalent in this zone [28] . Most of the villagers are subsistence farmers . The study was entirely qualitative and employed multiple methods ( focus group discussion ( FGD ) , in-depth interviews ( IDI ) and case studies ) to gain an in-depth understanding of community perspectives on behaviors related to shoe use , and the predominant facilitators and barriers to wearing shoes . Structured topic guides were used to direct discussions , focusing on local explanations for the causes of podoconiosis , attitudes towards individuals affected by podoconiosis , attitudes towards wearing shoes , and optimal role models and settings for promoting footwear among high-risk children . Case studies enabled deeper and more contextualized information to be gathered around an individual , with information gathered from the individual , from family members and from friends . An article describing community perceptions surrounding risk factors and prevention , including how adults' explanations of disease heredity influence shoe wearing and interpersonal behaviors , has recently been published [29] . The present paper focuses on the perceptions of participants regarding footwear and explores the major factors impeding shoe use in the community . Participants were recruited using convenience and snowball sampling methods . A total of 242 adults participated from the following three groups: ( 1 ) 69 adults affected with and receiving treatment for podoconiosis , \u201caffected\u201d; ( 2 ) 129 unaffected adults , with no current sign of or previous history of podoconiosis , \u201cunaffected\u201d; and ( 3 ) 44 community and religious leaders \u201ccommunity and religious leaders\u201d . None of the community leaders and religious leaders was currently affected by disease . The study took place in four of 14 communities served by the Mossy Foot Treatment and Prevention Association ( MFTPA ) a local non-governmental organization involved in the prevention and treatment of podoconiosis patients and shoe distribution for their children . The four sites were selected to represent the diversity of communities served with respect to size , duration of the relationship with MFTPA , and distance from the main office of the MFTPA . This study was conducted from June to August 2010 . The month of June was partly dry while the rest of the study was conducted in the rainy season . This allowed the researchers to observe community shoe wearing practices during both the dry and the rainy seasons . A trained research assistant ( Desta Ayode - DA ) spent up to three weeks in each of the four communities with Abebayehu Tora ( AT ) and one other data collector conducting focus group discussions , semi-structured in-depth interviews and extended case studies with research participants . A total of 38 IDIs , 28 FGDs and 7 case studies were conducted in the study sites . All materials used for the study were developed in English , and then translated into Amharic and Wolatigna . The discussion and interviews were conducted in either Amharic or Wolatigna , and were audio-recorded . The audio-recordings were first transcribed in the language in which they were conducted ( either in Amharic or Wolatigna ) , then translated into English . Translations of both study materials and transcripts were checked for consistency and to evaluate accuracy of important concepts . A total of four coders with different backgrounds ( Hendrik de Heer \u2013 the Netherlands , Emi Watanabe - Japan , Desta Ayode \u2013 Ethiopian resident and Tsega Gebreyesus \u2013 Ethiopian diaspora , the latter two Amharic speakers ) were involved in developing the coding scheme and coding the data in order to maximize the breadth and depth of the analysis . After initial reading of the transcripts , the interview themes served as a starting point for the codebook , and subthemes were created as they emerged from the data . These overarching themes included barriers and advantages to wearing shoes , beliefs about podoconiosis and perspectives on best settings for interventions to facilitate shoe wearing as a means of prevention of podoconiosis and other diseases . In weekly meetings , any suggested categories or themes to add were discussed and agreed upon by all coders before being added to the list of themes and sub-themes . All coders coded multiple data sources and overlapped with each of the three other coders . Every inconsistency between coders for a given source ( e . g . the transcript of a focus group ) was resolved through discussion . The first 10% of all transcripts was coded by all four coders and two-thirds of all transcripts were coded by at least two coders . NVIVO-9 Qualitative data analysis software was used to assess all themes in the transcripts ( NVIVO , QSR International , Burlington , MA 01803 , USA ) . For example , the major sub-themes that emerged for barriers to consistent shoe-wearing included: i ) financial barriers , ii ) unsuitability of available shoes for certain activities , iii ) low perceptions of adverse consequences as a result of not wearing shoes , iv ) difficulty finding appropriate shoe sizes and v ) fear of stigmatization as a result of wearing certain shoes . These themes are discussed in greater detail in the results section . \n Although many respondents aspired to wear shoes , the reality was rather different . Many adults possessed shoes , and most parents stated that they were trying to buy shoes for their children; however , respondents observed that shoes were not worn regularly by most members of their community . As stated above , barriers faced by all community members included financial constraints , poor access to footwear appropriate to a range of local activities , and low perceptions of disease risk . Podoconiosis patients faced two additional barriers: difficulty finding large enough sizes , and fear of stigma and labeling . In terms of wearing shoes , it appears that in Wolaita zone , like other rural parts of Ethiopia , people are moving from a \u2018norm\u2019 of going barefoot , to one where shoes are worn , and it is becoming \u2018shameful\u2019 to appear in public places without wearing shoes . Expansion of schools in rural communities and proliferation of the variety of shoes in local markets have contributed enormously to changing mindsets towards accepting footwear as a valuable commodity: The overwhelming majority of respondents were positive about wearing shoes . Both adults and children emphasized that , despite the impediments to securing footwear , everyone in the community was in favor of having shoes: The following excerpts demonstrate that social pressures ( and not just issues related to disease prevention ) are important in driving the community norm towards wearing shoes: Even young children communicate their wish for shoes to parents: attempting to wear their parents' shoes , nagging their parents to buy them shoes , and refusing to attend school barefoot . In many families , it is the children who press their parents into buying their first shoes . As one parent said , The following excerpts also illustrate this very well: In this specific area , although the MFTPA has worked to circulate messages about podoconiosis prevention for more than ten years , this does not appear to be an important reason for wearing shoes in the wider community . Adults emphasized using shoes to participate in social settings and public gatherings , while children emphasized the protective value of shoes against pain of walking on stones and other sharp objects . Respondents in many groups also mentioned that shoes protected them from cold and injuries , enabled walking and looked attractive on the feet . In some cases , shoes were worn simply because they saw others wearing them . Since podoconiosis patients had been advised to wear shoes by the MFTPA , we found that the practices of treated patients differed from those of the general community: Among patients , primary prevention may beneficially be linked with disease treatment , and patients using shoes for secondary prevention of complications may not only model behavior changes but also encourage them in children . If I leave home without shoes , I immediately get sick . I can't step even a short distance without shoes . So , shoes are important to protect us from the painful feeling . ( Affected female , age 28 ) \n Shoe wearing was intermittent , with adults more likely to say they wore shoes for social events and gatherings including market attendance , church services , weddings and funerals . Farmers , both male and female , rarely wore shoes while working in the fields , and many householders did not wear them while gathering wood or fetching water . Although children were usually encouraged to wear shoes at school , they were often dissuaded , sometimes forcibly , from wearing them for housework or play . More consistent use of shoes was reported by podoconiosis patients than the wider community , several patients referring to advice received from the MFTPA . Perception of risk appeared to be an important contributor to this difference in behavior: patients reported changing their own shoe wearing behavior and influencing that of their children , while non-affected community members wore shoes less or not at all . Several articles have linked risk perception with actions related to health-seeking behavior , people with higher perceived vulnerability to illness being more likely to engage in protective behavior [30] . Research on foot care and footwear practices of peoples with diabetes [31] , [32] has demonstrated similar links between use of shoes and perceived risk of disease to those presented here . This suggests that any future NTD interventions based on shoe distribution to individuals with disease must be accompanied by messages that appropriately convey mechanisms by which diseases occur and individual and community levels of risk . While patients viewed shoes as a means of protection from disease , non-affected adults indicated they were beginning to have more general social value . Shoe wearing was seen as a mark of dignity , while going barefoot was seen as \u2018shameful\u2019 , particularly by the younger generations . Some participants suggested that shoe wearing norms were in the process of change , and one directly ascribed this to education - \u201cthe advancement of education has changed the minds of the people\u2026 today\u201d . Clearly , drivers of change in this norm are acting at many levels , and though some may be harnessed in intervention programs , others will be beyond easy reach . Children are also aware of the \u2018shame\u2019 of going to school barefoot , but also mentioned the role of shoes in preventing injuries from stones , thorns and other sharp objects . Future programs will need to address all these motivations for shoe use and highlight the range of benefits that shoe wearing is likely to bring . Recurring barriers mentioned by study participants that are likely to be relevant in other NTD-endemic communities , were those of financial constraint and poor suitability of shoes for the most common activities . Financial constraints were reported to influence possession of shoes , type of shoe bought , age at which a child starts wearing , which children get shoes within families , consistency of use , frequency of replacement and activities for which they were worn . As with many health interventions whose benefits will only become apparent in the longer term , families naturally prioritized more immediate concerns such as food . Currently , in this area , shoes are being distributed free of charge , but this is unlikely to be sustainable in the long term or scalable to all rural populations exposed to NTDs . However , if shoes are to be considered health interventions rather than pure commodities , subsidies or micro-credit strategies that bring shoes within the reach of very-low income families must be contemplated . Social protection strategies like these may bring the necessary empowerment for individuals to realize the behavior changes they may desire to make . Several participants gave highly practical reasons for preferring not to wear shoes while farming , saying that the shoes available in the market quickly became heavy with mud and failed to grip in the rainy season , and became uncomfortable when rough soil particles slipped inside during the dry season . Long Wellington-type boots might prevent these problems , but are more expensive than the shoes currently available . Clearly , promoting footwear that is appropriate to local activities and effective against the specific NTD is essential . For example , the prevention of snakebites in rice paddies will require different footwear than those required for the prevention of chronic larva migrans on the beach . Some barriers to use of footwear were patient-specific . Swelling of the feet and lower limbs , nodules and wounds may make use of normal-shaped shoes impossible . Molla and colleagues [33] have documented similar challenges faced by podoconiosis patients in northern Ethiopia . Custom-made shoes might overcome these difficulties , and have been developed for patients with leprosy in similar resource-limited rural communities . Legs to Stand On , an initiative to prevent disabling disease of the lower limb in resource-poor settings , is leading cross-disease efforts to increase capacity to manufacture custom-made shoes in these communities . However , custom-made shoes bring with them the possibility of stigma through labeling as \u2018diseased\u2019 . This was raised as a very real barrier by a number of patient participants in our study . Some had developed tactics to mitigate the stigma they faced , by removing their shoes in certain situations , while others had abandoned them completely . Stigma has been documented , against podoconiosis patients and their families [26] , [34] against patients with leprosy [35] and lymphatic filariasis [36] , and interventions against these or other NTDs must not risk increasing stigma . In the future , much more attention must be directed to the design of custom-made shoes so that they do not increase stigma in relation to any NTD . Several investigators have suggested that lack of association between footwear and disease in observational studies reflects poorly refined measurement of shoe wearing behavior . In most studies , there is no clear definition of the length of time spent wearing shoes or the activities for which they are worn . For example , while individuals may state they wear shoes \u2018most of the time\u2019 , they may remove them to plough , sow , harvest or fish . These activities may represent the time of greatest exposure to infective or other agents . Many quantitative studies investigating the link between incidence or prevalence of NTDs and footwear have used simple questions such as \u2018Do you wear shoes ? \u2019 with binary response options [8] , [11] , [13]\u2013[15] . Our participants describe complex behaviors , wearing shoes in certain settings ( including in church services and at school ) but not in others ( often those where exposure is more likely , such as farming ) . Clearly , more nuanced questions must be asked of study participants if a true picture of shoe wearing is to be captured . Better designed questions , informed by qualitative research , will allow identification of potential points of behavioral intervention that take into account the structural barriers posed by rural poverty . We have explored behaviors related to use of shoes in a low-income rural setting where several NTDs including podoconiosis are prevalent [37] . We used a range of qualitative techniques among multiple target groups . Although the study included a large sample , all respondents were drawn from the same rural highland community in Ethiopia , and so we suggest caution in generalizing the reported outcomes to other cultural settings . Although we hoped to reduce social desirability bias by collecting data through individuals not linked to the MFTPA organization , it is likely that the information given by some respondents was still influenced by their wishes for perceived social conformity . Although shoes are desired , they are either not worn or not worn sufficiently consistently to prevent disease . Consistent with well established conceptual models of health behavior adoption , we identified several barriers to shoe wearing that are amenable to intervention [25] . Moreover , several of these barriers will arise in other settings in relation to other NTDs , and we encourage program developers to consider each of these before developing theory-based interventions to encourage shoe wearing .", "headings": ["Abstract", "Introduction", "Methods", "Results", "Discussion"], "keywords": ["medicine", "preventive medicine", "social discrimination", "environmental health", "social and behavioral sciences", "social prejudice", "behavioral and social aspects of health", "global health", "sociology", "social research", "public health"], "id": "journal.pntd.0002199"}
{"lay_summary": "Alpha herpesviruses are common mammalian pathogens ( e . g . herpes simplex and chickenpox virus infect humans ) . These viruses enter and spread in and out of the mammalian nervous system , a defining hallmark of their lifecycle and potential pathogenesis . Neurons are polarized cells , and the movement of certain cellular proteins is highly restricted to the cell body , to dendrites , or to axons . Indeed , the axon harbors only a small subset of neuronal proteins . Thus , it is remarkable that these viruses efficiently gather and move their structural components from the cell body to the axon after infection of neurons . Previously , we identified a small viral membrane protein ( known as Us9 ) that mediates the efficient targeting of virus particles to axons of infected neurons . We now report that Us9 must localize to \u201clipid raft\u201d domains , specialized regions within cellular membranes to promote axonal targeting . Reducing the affinity of Us9 for lipid rafts dramatically reduces sorting of structural proteins to axons . This is the first report , to our knowledge , to implicate lipid rafts in targeting alpha herpesvirus structural proteins to axons , an essential step for spread of infection in the mammalian nervous system .", "article": "The pseudorabies virus ( PRV ) Us9 protein plays a central role in targeting viral capsids and glycoproteins to axons of dissociated sympathetic neurons . As a result , Us9 null mutants are defective in anterograde transmission of infection in vivo . However , it is unclear how Us9 promotes axonal sorting of so many viral proteins . It is known that the glycoproteins gB , gC , gD and gE are associated with lipid raft microdomains on the surface of infected swine kidney cells and monocytes , and are directed into the axon in a Us9-dependent manner . In this report , we determined that Us9 is associated with lipid rafts , and that this association is critical to Us9-mediated sorting of viral structural proteins . We used infected non-polarized and polarized PC12 cells , a rat pheochromocytoma cell line that acquires many of the characteristics of sympathetic neurons in the presence of nerve growth factor ( NGF ) . In these cells , Us9 is highly enriched in detergent-resistant membranes ( DRMs ) . Moreover , reducing the affinity of Us9 for lipid rafts inhibited anterograde transmission of infection from sympathetic neurons to epithelial cells in vitro . We conclude that association of Us9 with lipid rafts is key for efficient targeting of structural proteins to axons and , as a consequence , for directional spread of PRV from pre-synaptic to post-synaptic neurons and cells of the mammalian nervous system . \n Neurons are highly polarized cells with distinct biochemical and functional properties particular to the cell body ( soma ) , dendrites , and the axon . Soluble , cytosolic proteins likely move into axons and dendrites by bulk flow , while membrane proteins are highly restricted to the somatodendritic membrane , the axonal membrane , or within vesicles [1] . Sorting of membrane proteins to the somatodendritic or axonal compartments of neurons is similar to the sorting mechanism of membrane proteins either to the basolateral or to the apical membranes of epithelial cells [2] . Both cell types share a common component for compartmentalization of their membrane milieu: lipid raft microdomains . Rafts often are defined biochemically as detergent-resistant membranes ( DRMs ) or detergent-insoluble glycolipid complexes ( DIGs ) [3]\u2013[5] . These protein-lipid complexes are highly enriched in cholesterol and sphingolipids , and float freely within the liquid-disordered state of the lipid bilayer . Furthermore , they are small and dynamic , often ordering themselves into larger , more stable rafts through protein-protein and protein-lipid interactions [6] , [7] . Lipid rafts/DRMs play a key role in the axonal sorting of membrane proteins during neuronal maturation , including axonal growth and guidance [8] . Ledesma et al . showed that two axonally-targeted membrane proteins , Thy-1 and influenza virus hemagglutinin ( HA ) , interact with sphingolipid-cholesterol rafts in rat hippocampal neurons [9] . These microdomains normally were resistant to detergent treatment at 4\u00b0C . However , reducing the levels of cholesterol and sphingolipids resulted in the detergent-solubility of both proteins , as well as aberrant sorting into axons [9] . The increased synthesis of sphingomyelin during neuronal maturation was critical for the formation of protein-lipid complexes , an essential step for the targeting of randomly distributed GM1 ganglioside in immature neurons to the axon of fully mature neurons [4] . Alpha herpesviruses ( e . g . herpes simplex virus ( HSV ) and pseudorabies virus ( PRV ) ) replicate and traffic within polarized neurons , a strategy conducive to their lifestyle in the host peripheral nervous system ( PNS ) . Infection begins with virion entry at mucosal surfaces and spread of infection between cells of the mucosal epithelium . The PNS is infected through axon termini innervating this region , and subsequent trafficking of capsids to the cell body . It is here that a reactivatable , latent infection is established that persists for the life of the host [10] . A well known , but poorly understood observation , is that upon reactivation from the latent infection , \u03b1-herpesviruses rarely enter the central nervous system despite having what seems to be two rather similar choices: cross one synapse and infect the central nervous system ( rare ) or traffic back down the axon to the initial peripheral site of infection ( very common ) . Inherent in this choice is the fact that viral proteins must be targeted to axons , a highly specialized neuronal compartment restricted to only a subset of neuronal proteins . The primary problem is to identify the mechanisms that gather and sort the many viral structural proteins to this compartment . The Us9 gene product , a small , tail-anchored type II membrane protein , has been of interest in understanding the mechanisms of anterograde transport of alpha herpesviruses in the mammalian nervous system [11]\u2013[14] . PRV Us9 directs viral membrane proteins and capsids to axons of infected neurons [15] , [16] , an absolute requirement for anterograde neuron-to-cell and neuron-to-neuron spread of the virus [11] , [17] . Our current data demonstrate that in the absence of PRV Us9 , axons do not contain vesicles with viral glycoproteins or mature virus particles [15] . However , the mechanism by which this occurs has not been elucidated . Favoreel et al . reported that PRV glycoproteins gB , gC , gD , and gE were associated with lipid rafts on the surface of infected swine kidney cells and monocytes [18] . PRV Us9 is essential for the trafficking of these glycoproteins into the axon of dissociated superior cervical ganglia ( SCG ) neurons [16] . These observations , in conjunction with reports that raft association is critical for axonal targeting of certain neuronal membrane proteins [4] , [9] , [19] led us to investigate whether PRV Us9 was associated with detergent-insoluble lipid rafts . \n All PRV strains were propagated on porcine kidney ( PK15 ) cells at a low multiplicity of infection ( MOI ) for 48 hours and then collected by scraping cells into the conditioned medium as described previously [15] . The wild-type PRV strain Becker and its derivatives , PRV 99 , PRV 160 , and PRV 162 were described previously [11] , [20]\u2013[22] . PRV 99 is deleted for the sequence encoding both gE and gI . PRV 160 ( Us9-null ) contains a nonsense stop mutation at position 4 in the Us9 open reading frame . PRV 162 encodes a mutant Us9 protein in which the nucleotide sequence encoding amino acids 46 to 55 have been removed ( i . e . the acidic cluster region ) . To construct PRV 322 , the wild-type transmembrane domain of PRV Us9 was replaced with that of the transferrin receptor ( TfR ) transmembrane domain [23] , [24] . This was performed by the SOEing PCR method [25] using pML47 as the template . This plasmid contains the SpHI/MluI region of the Becker BamHI 7 fragment cloned into pBluescript SK ( + ) . The upstream fragment was amplified using the upstream-forward primer 5\u2032 GCATGCTCTCGCCGGTGT 3\u2032 and the downstream-reverse primer 5\u2032 aaatccaatcaagaaaaagacgatcacag aatagtcccatagcagatacttccactaca GCGGCGGCGTCTCCGGCG 3\u2032 . The downstream fragment was amplified using the upstream-forward primer 5\u2032tattgctgtgatcgtctttttcttgattggatttatgattggctacttgggctattgtCGGCACGTGTAGCGAGCGGGT3\u2032 and the downstream-reverse primer 5\u2032 ACGCGTAGCACCACTCGG 3\u2032 . Upper case letters represent PRV sequences whereas lower case letters represent sequences introduced to synthesize the TfR TMD domain . Both the upstream and downstream fragments were gel-purified , and ligated together using the upstream-forward primer 5\u2032 GCATGCTCTCGCCGGTGT 3\u2032 and the downstream-reverse primer 5\u2032 ACGCGTAGCACCACTCGG 3\u2032 . The SOEing product was cloned directly into the pCR-Blunt II-TOPO vector ( TOPO Cloning Kit , Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) and sequenced to verify that no extraneous mutations were introduced during PCR . This plasmid was designated pML55 . We then digested pML55 with the restriction enzymes BsrGI and MluI to release a \u223c1 . 0 kb fragment that contained the Us9 gene with the TfR transmembrane domain . This fragment was used to replace the BsrGI/MluI fragment of pML68 , a pT7Blue vector backbone containing a SalI/SpHI fragment spanning a large portion of the unique-short region ( a splice product of the SalI/MluI fragment of pPH 2 and the MluI/SpHI fragment from pGS166 ) . It includes a portion of the gD gene , gI , gE , Us9 , and virtually the entire Us2 gene . This construct ( designated pML73 ) was digested with EcoRI/HindIII and cotransfected with purified PRV 165 genomic DNA [26] into PK15 cells . Plaques not expressing EGFP were identified using a Nikon Eclipse TE300 inverted epifluorescence microscope and then subjected to three rounds of plaque purification . This recombinant virus was named PRV 319 . Initial characterization of PRV 319 revealed that Us9-TfR unexpectedly formed a dimer inside infected PK15 and PC12 cells ( unlike the monomeric form of wild-type Us9 ) . We discovered that two cysteine residues at the N- and C-terminus of the TfR transmembrane domain were responsible for disulfide-bonded dimer formation and protein acylation [27] . We deleted these codons from pML55 using the Stratagene Quickchange II site-directed mutagenesis kit ( Stratagene , La Jolla , CA ) . This construct , denoted pML86 , was digested with the restriction enzymes BsrGI and MluI and the 1 kb fragment was cloned into the pML68 shuttle vector . This construct ( designated pML88 ) was digested with EcoRI/HindIII and cotransfected with purified PRV 165 genomic DNA [26] into PK15 cells . Non-green plaques were identified and purified as described above . This recombinant virus was designated PRV 322 . The presence of the Us9-TfR chimeric protein , as well as the presence of gE and Us2 ( genes directly upstream and downstream of Us9 , respectively ) were verified by western blot of infected cell lysates . Antibodies used in this report include: polyclonal rabbit antiserum recognizing Us9 ( [28]; used 1\u2236500 by WB and 1\u2236200 by IF ) , the gE cytoplasmic domain ( [29]; used 1\u22361000 by WB ) , and PRV antigens ( Rb134 [21] , [22]; used 1\u223610 , 000 by IF ) , polyclonal goat antiserum recognizing gB , gC , Us2 , and UL34 ( [22] , [30]; all used 1\u22361000 by WB ) , and mouse monoclonal antibody recognizing transferrin receptor ( Zymed , San Francisco , CA ) . The rabbit polyclonal gH antiserum was a kind gift from Thomas Mettenleiter [31] . All secondary Alexa fluorophores ( used at 1\u2236500 ) were purchased from Molecular Probes . A detailed protocol for culturing and differentiating PC12 cells prior to infection with PRV has been published previously [32] . Briefly , we coated the surface of a 150 mm dish with rat tail collagen ( type 1 ) at a concentration of 5 \u00b5g/cm2 in 0 . 02 N ascetic acid for 1 hour . The dish was washed gently three times with sterile water , and 20 ml of complete growth medium ( 85% RPMI , 10% horse serum , 5% fetal calf serum ) was added to the plate . A 100 mm dish with undifferentiated PC12 cells ( \u223c80% confluency ) was split 1\u22365 , and triturated extensively with a sterile 5 ml plunger and 22-gauge needle to dissociate cell clumps . After trituration , 1 ml of cell suspension was added to the 150 mm dish , and cells were allowed to attach overnight in a 37\u00b0C incubator . To produce a culture of differentiated PC12 cells , growth medium was replaced with differentiation medium ( RPMI , 1% horse serum , nerve growth factor ( 100 ng/ml ) ) when cells became \u223c30% confluent . Differentiation medium was replaced every other day for 12 days , at which time an extensive network of neurites was visible . Undifferentiated PC12 cells were propagated in growth medium to \u223c70% confluency prior to infection with PRV . Live imaging of viral capsids was performed using a Leica SP5 with an HCX Plan Apochromat 63\u00d71 . 3 NA glycerin objective . Approximately 15 optical sections were acquired in 0 . 5-\u00b5m steps through the plane of the neurites and cell body . Each frame of the movie is a 2D projection of one stack of images . Prior to imaging , 1 M HEPES was added to the RPMI medium to a final concentration of 25 mM . PC12 cells were cultured on MatTek Corp . glass-bottomed dishes ( http://www . glass-bottom-dishes . com/ ) . The dish was warmed to 37\u00b0C employing a DH40i Micro-incubation System ( Warner Instrument Corp . ) run at constant voltage ( \u223c5 . 5 volts ) . A 488 nm laser line was used for GFP excitation ( 10% intensity ) , with emissions collected from 495 to 553 nm . Images were acquired employing a 1 . 5 airy unit detector pinhole and scanning at 700 Hertz . All figures were assembled in Adobe Photoshop 7 . 0 . 1 . Movies were created using ImageJ 1 . 32j software ( National Institutes of Health ) . Flotation of lipid rafts by Optiprep\u2122sucrose gradient is well documented in the literature [33]\u2013[35] , though subtle differences exist between protocols . We followed those described previously for PRV-infected SK cells [18] and uninfected PC12 cells [36] . Undifferentiated and differentiated PC12 cells were cultured in a 150 mm dish as described above ( \u223c107 cells ) . Cells were infected at a high multiplicity of infection ( MOI\u200a=\u200a10 ) with PRV Becker , PRV 99 , PRV 162 , or PRV 322 . At 12 hours post-infection ( hpi ) , cells were collected in a 50 ml conical tube , and washed twice with cold RPMI medium by brief centrifugation at 3 , 000 rpm . Cells were lysed with 1 ml of lysis buffer consisting of 1% TX-100 in TNE buffer ( 25 mM Tris HCl [pH 6 . 8] , 150 mM NaCl , 5 mM EDTA ) , protease inhibitor cocktail ( Roche Diagnostics GmbH , Mannheim , Germany ) , and 5 mM iodoacetamide . The lysate was homogenized by being passed 15 times through an 18-gauge needle , and then allowed to rock for 30 minutes at 4\u00b0C . At the end of the rocking period , the sample was again homogenized briefly , and then mixed with 2 ml of ice-cold 60% Optiprep\u2122 density gradient medium ( Sigma-Aldrich , St . Louis , MO ) . The entire 3 ml mixture was placed at the bottom of a Beckman SW41 ultracentrifuge tube ( Beckman , Munich , Germany ) and subsequently overlaid with 5 ml of ice-cold 30% Optiprep in TNE and 4 ml of ice-cold 5% Optiprep in TNE . Samples were centrifuged at 34 , 200 rpm ( 200 , 000\u00d7g ) at 4\u00b0C for 20 hours . Twelve fractions were collected from the top to the bottom of the tube ( 1 ml each ) , and mixed 1\u22361 with 2\u00d7 Laemmli sample buffer . Samples 3\u201310 were electrophoresed on a 12% SDS-PAGE gel . PK15 cells were grown to confluency in 60 mm dishes ( \u223c3\u00d7106 cells/dish ) , and infected with the indicated viruses at an MOI of 10 . Following a one-hour adsorption period at 37\u00b0C , the cells were rinsed once with PBS and incubated at room temperature for three minutes with 3 ml of citrate buffer ( 40 mM sodium citrate , 10 mM KCl , 135 mM NaCl , pH 3 . 0 ) to inactivate unabsorbed virus . The cells were rinsed three times with PBS , 2 ml of fresh medium were added , and plates were returned to the incubator . At various times post-infection , cells were scraped into the medium and frozen in two aliquots . Aliquots were freeze-thawed three times ( \u221280\u00b0C/+37\u00b0C ) and titered in duplicate on PK15 cell monolayers . Virions were purified as described previously [28] . Briefly , three confluent 150-mm-diameter dishes of PK15 cells were infected with virus at a MOI of 10 . At 16 hpi , medium was collected and centrifuged at 3 , 000 rpm to remove cellular debris . The clarified supernatant was layered on a 7 ml 30% sucrose-PBS cushion ( w/v ) in two Beckman SW28 centrifuge tubes . The tubes were then centrifuged in an SW28 rotor at 23 , 000 rpm for 3 hours . The sucrose cushion was removed , and the virion pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of PBS by 10 one-second pulses in a bath sonicator and gentle pipetting . Virions were then centrifuged through a 1 ml 30% sucrose cushion at 28 , 000 rpm for 90 minutes in an SW55ti rotor . The pelleted virions were resuspended in 100 \u00b5l PBS , and subsequently mixed with Laemmli sample buffer for analysis by SDS-PAGE . To analyze steady-state viral protein expression , PK15 cells ( \u223c3 . 0\u00d7106 ) were either mock infected or infected at a high MOI with Becker or PRV 322 . At 6 hpi , medium was removed and infected cells were scraped into 330 \u00b5l of PBS and 170 \u00b5l of 3\u00d7 Laemmli sample buffer . Samples were homogenized with an insulin syringe , boiled for 2 minutes , and subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( SDS-PAGE ) . Preparation of lipid raft fractions and purified virions for SDS-PAGE is described above . All gels were transferred to an Immobilon-P membrane using a semidry transfer apparatus following the manufacturer's instructions ( Labconco , Kansas City , MO ) . Following transfer , membranes were immediately put into blocking solution ( 2% bovine serum albumin in TBS ( 50 mM Tris , 200 mM NaCl ) ( w/v ) , 0 . 1% Tween-20 ( v/v ) ) and incubated for 15 minutes at RT . Primary antibody was diluted in 2% BSA-TBS-Tween solution , and allowed to rock for 30 minutes with the membrane . GM1 was detected using biotinylated cholera toxin B subunit ( 1 \u00b5g/ml , Sigma-Aldrich , St . Louis , MO ) and a HRP-streptavidin conjugate ( 1\u22361000 , Pierce , Rockford , IL ) . Following the 30 minute incubation , the membrane was washed three times with TBS-Tween , and placed in HRP-conjugated secondary antibody ( 1\u223610 , 000 , KPL , Gaithersburg , Maryland ) diluted in 2% BSA-TBS-Tween for 30 minutes . The membrane was then washed as previously described , and proteins were visualized with the ECL Plus Western blotting detection system ( GE Healthcare ) . PK15 cells were grown on glass coverslips ( \u223c20% confluence ) and transfected with mammalian expression vectors encoding GFP ( pEGFP-N1 ) , Us9-GFP ( pBB14 ) , and Us9-TfR-GFP ( pML92 ) using Lipofectamine 2000 as directed by the manufacturer's instructions ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) . At 24 hours post-transfection , cells were washed with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min . After fixation , cells were washed three times with PBS , and stained with Hoechst 33342 ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) . Samples were then mounted on a glass slide using Aqua poly/mount ( Polysciences , Warrington , PA ) and allowed to air dry for 24 hours prior to imaging . Direct fluorescence was visualized using an inverted epifluorescence microscope and the appropriate excitation and emission filters . For indirect immunofluorescence experiments , PK15 cells were grown to 30% confluence on glass coverslips and infected with Becker , PRV 160 , and PRV 322 . At 6 hpi , cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline ( PBS ) , then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min . After fixation , cells were washed three times with PBS , and permeabilized for 3\u20135 minutes with 0 . 5% Triton X-100 in PBS . After permeabilization , Us9 antiserum was diluted 1\u2236200 in wash buffer ( PBS , 3% BSA , 0 . 5% saponin ) and added to cells for 1 hour . Primary antibody was then removed , and the sample washed three times . Next , secondary antibodies were added to the sample and incubated for 1 hour . Secondary antibody was then removed and the sample was washed an additional three times . Samples were mounted on a glass slide using Aqua poly/mount and allowed to air dry for 24 hours prior to imaging . Optical sections were acquired using a Leica SP5 confocal microscope with a 63\u00d7/1 . 3 NA oil objective . Detailed protocols for dissecting and culturing PNS neurons from rat embryos have been published previously [32] . Briefly , sympathetic neurons from the superior cervical ganglia ( SCG ) were dissected from rat embryos at embryonic day 15 . 5 to 16 . 5 ( Sprague-Dawley rats , Hilltop Labs , Inc . , Scottdale , PA ) and incubated in 250 \u00b5g/ml of trypsin ( Worthington Biochemicals ) for 10 min . Trypsin inhibitor ( 1 mg/ml; Sigma Aldrich ) was added to neutralize the trypsin for 5 min and then removed and replaced with neuron culture medium ( described below ) . Prior to plating , the ganglia were triturated using a fire-polished Pasteur pipette and then plated in the S compartments of the Teflon ring . The Teflon ring was placed within a 35-mm plastic tissue culture dish coated with 500 \u00b5g/ml of poly-DL-ornithine ( Sigma Aldrich ) diluted in borate buffer and 10 \u00b5g/ml of natural mouse laminin ( Invitrogen ) . The neuron culture medium is serum free and consists of Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium ( Invitrogen ) and Ham's F12 ( Invitrogen ) in a 1\u22361 ratio . The serum-free medium was further supplemented with 10 mg/ml of bovine serum albumin ( Sigma Aldrich ) , 4 . 6 mg/ml glucose ( J . T . Baker ) , 100 \u00b5g/ml of holotransferrin ( Sigma Aldrich ) , 16 \u00b5g/ml of putrescine ( Sigma Aldrich ) , 10 \u00b5g/ml of insulin ( Sigma Aldrich ) , 2 mM of L-glutamine ( Invitrogen ) , 50 \u00b5g/ml or U of penicillin-streptomycin ( Invitrogen ) , 30 nM of selenium ( Sigma Aldrich ) , 20 nM of progesterone ( Sigma Aldrich ) , and 100 ng/ml of nerve growth factor 2 . 5S ( Invitrogen ) . Two days after plating , the neuronal cultures were treated with 1 \u00b5M of antimitotic drug cytosine \u00df-D-arabinofuranoside ( AraC; Sigma Aldrich ) to eliminate any nonneuronal cells . The neuron culture medium was replaced every 3 to 4 days , and cultures were maintained in a humidified , CO2-regulated , 37\u00b0C incubator . All experimental protocols related to animal use were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Princeton University Research Board under protocol number 1691 and are in accordance with the regulations of the American Association for Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care and those in the Animal Welfare Act ( public law 99-198 ) . Protocols for assembling the trichamber system have been described previously [17] , [37] . Tools and reagents , including the Teflon rings ( Tyler Research , Alberta , Canada ) and the silicone grease-loaded syringe ( Dow Corning ) , were sterilized by autoclaving prior to assembly . Tissue culture dishes ( 35 mm ) were coated with 500 \u00b5g/ml of poly-DL-ornithine ( Sigma Aldrich ) followed by 10 \u00b5g/ml of natural mouse laminin ( Invitrogen ) , and then washed and dried; the bottom surface of each dish was etched with a pin rake , creating a series of 16 evenly spaced grooves . We used a silicone grease-loaded syringe attached to an 18-gauge truncated hypodermic needle to apply a thin , continuous strip of silicone grease over the entire bottom surface of the Teflon ring . Next , a 50-\u00b5l drop of neuron medium containing 1% methocellulose ( serum free ) was placed in the center of each tissue culture dish covering the etched grooves . This step prevents the seal from being entirely devoid of moisture , which is needed for axon penetration and growth between the grooves . Finally , the silicone grease-coated ring was gently seated on the tissue culture dish or the surface of the 35-mm dish such that the etched grooves spanned all three compartments , forming a watertight seal between compartments . Neuron medium was then placed in all three compartments immediately after the chamber was assembled . Once the SCG neurons were dissected and dissociated , approximately one half of a single ganglion was plated into the S chamber . Neuron cultures were then maintained according to the protocols for culturing neurons reported above . Neurons were cultured for approximately 2 weeks in the trichamber system ( on 35 mm tissue culture dishes ) with frequent medium changes . After 2 weeks , axon penetration into the M and N compartments was assessed visually and only cultures with comparable axon densities were used for experiments . After axons penetrated the N compartment , nonneuronal epithelial cells ( PK15 cells ) permissive for PRV infection were plated in the N compartment . The neuron medium in the N compartment was supplemented with 1% fetal bovine serum and the cells were allowed to attach and expand for 24 h prior to any experiment . Once the target cells in the N compartment were plated , neuron medium containing 1% methocel was placed in the M compartment . After 30 min , the neuronal cell bodies in the S compartment were infected with virus diluted in neuron medium ( approximately 105 PFU ) . After 1 h , the viral inoculum was removed and replaced with neuron medium . The chambers were then incubated in a humidified 37\u00b0C incubator for 24 hours . Both intracellular and extracellular virions in the S and N compartments were carefully harvested by scraping the bottom of the dish with the pointed end of a gel-loading tip . The cells and medium were then pooled and freeze-thawed , and titers were determined . Trichambers were assembled on UV-sterilized Aclar strips . Neurons were cultured and infected as described above . At 16 hpi , all compartments were washed twice with PBS containing 3% BSA ( PBS/BSA ) , chambers gently lifted , and silicone grease scraped off the Aclar strips . Samples were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 minutes . Fixative was washed away with three PBS/BSA rinses , after which the samples were permeabilized using a solution of 0 . 5% saponin and 3% BSA in PBS ( PBS/BSA/SAP ) . Incubations with primary and secondary antibodies were performed for one hour in PBS/BSA/SAP . Following two rinses with PBS/BSA/SAP and one rinse with distilled water , the samples were mounted on glass slides using Aqua poly/mount ( Polysciences ) . Images were collected on a Perkin-Elmer RS3 spinning disk confocal microscope using a 40\u00d71 . 3 NA oil objective . Z-stacks obtained in 1-micron steps were collapsed and analyzed in Perkin-Elmer ImageView software . \n The characterization of lipid rafts has largely been based on their resistance to detergent solubilization at 4\u00b0C [3] . This approach continues to be a useful tool to assess the affinity a protein has for lipid rafts when formed at physiologic temperatures [38] , [39] . Analyses performed on changes in DRM partitioning ( due to a physiological stimulus ) have provided the foundation for extensive work on the role of lipid rafts in signal transduction [40]\u2013[42] , membrane trafficking [43] , [44] , and pathogenesis [45] . Accordingly , we investigated the affinity of Us9 for DRMs , as well as several viral glycoproteins whose axonal localization is dependent on Us9 [16] . It is difficult to culture a sufficient number of primary rat neurons to perform large biochemical analyses . Therefore , we used PC12 cells , a widely used rat pheochromocytoma cell line that responds to nerve growth factor ( NGF ) and acquires many of the characteristics of sympathetic neurons [46] . Differentiated PC12 undergo polarized protein sorting , and cell bodies stain for nonphosphorylated neurofilament H ( a somatodendritic marker ) while axons stain exclusively for phosphorylated neurofilament H ( an axonal marker ) [32] . This is consistent with mature , sympathetic SCG neurons [47] . It has been reported that PC12 cell are susceptible and permissive to PRV infection [48] , and that a PRV GFP-VP22 fusion protein moves inside neurites with fast axonal kinetics [49] . However , it was unclear whether the Us9-null phenotype in SCG neurons , i . e . a complete block to axonal sorting of viral structural proteins [15] , [16] , could be recapitulated in this neuron-like cell line ( a critical experiment to ensure that PC12 cells could be used to study Us9 biology ) . We recently reported that in the absence of Us9 , GFP-tagged capsids were unable to sort into axons of live SCG neurons [15] . Therefore , we utilized a similar live-cell imaging approach to examine the axonal sorting of GFP-tagged capsids in differentiated PC12 cells . Cells were infected with PRV GS443 , a recombinant PRV strain that expresses GFP fused to VP26 , a capsid protein [50] . After 12 h , capsid puncta were readily observed trafficking in the anterograde direction within neurites of PC12 cells ( n\u200a=\u200a20 ) ( Figure 1A , Video S1 ) . Importantly , when differentiated PC12 cells were infected with PRV 368 , a GFP-tagged capsid mutant deleted for Us9 , no green puncta were observed moving in the anterograde direction ( Figure 1B and 1C , Video S2 ) . These findings were consistent with our Us9 studies in dissociated SCG neurons [15] . Interestingly , we also observed the retrograde trafficking of capsid puncta from cells infected with PRV 368 to uninfected , neighboring cells ( in the absence of any anterograde sorting of virus particles in the same field of view ) ( Figure 1D\u20131F , Videos S3 and S4 ) . This had been described previously in transneuronal spread studies on Us9 mutants in the rat visual system [11] , [26] , but had not been observed in tissue culture cells . It is noteworthy that we did not visualize \u201crandom\u201d egress of GFP-tagged capsids from infected cell bodies . Capsids either sorted into axons ( in the presence of Us9 ) , or to sites of synaptic contact with other axons ( transneuronal , retrograde transport ) . The import of this observation is unclear at present , but may suggest that alpha herpesviruses undergo directed egress from neuronal cell bodies . Overall , our findings suggest that differentiated PC12 cells recapitulate the Us9 sorting phenotypes previously observed in primary sympathetic neurons , and are an efficacious cell line to study Us9 biology ( specifically that of Us9 and lipid rafts ) . Therefore , we compared the raft profiles of viral membrane proteins after infection of non-polarized and polarized PC12 cells . Undifferentiated cells ( \u223c107 ) were infected with wild-type Becker for 12 hours , solubilized with 1% TX-100 , and subjected to a well-described \u201craft flotation\u201d assay [33]\u2013[35] . Membrane proteins that were solubilized by TX-100 remained at the bottom of the Opti-Prep gradient ( 40% ) , whereas proteins in DRMs floated to the 5%\u201330% interface . We used the prototypic raft and non-raft markers , GM1 ganglioside and transferrin receptor ( TfR ) , as positive and negative controls [51] . Us9 was highly enriched in the raft fraction as compared to the soluble population ( Figure 2 ) . To test whether the flotation of Us9 was cholesterol dependent , we treated cells with methyl-cyclodextrin ( MCD ) prior to solubilization with detergent . MCD depletes cholesterol from cellular membranes , and therefore disrupts the structure of lipid raft microdomains [52] , [53] . A 45-minute exposure of 20 mM MCD to Becker-infected cells dramatically decreased the amount of Us9 floating with the raft fraction . We found the viral glycoprotein gB to have a strong affinity for DRMs while gE and gC where not enriched in either the raft or soluble fractions . These findings were consistent with similar experiments performed in non-polarized swine kidney ( SK ) cells [18] . Surprisingly , PRV gH was completely solubilized by TX-100 treatment , as was transferrin receptor ( the negative control ) . Overall , Us9 and gB have a strong affinity for DRMs in undifferentiated PC12 cells . Both gE and gC were present in the raft and soluble fractions in a \u223c1\u22361 ratio , whereas gH was completely soluble . To determine the effect of cell polarization on DRM partitioning , we cultured PC12 cells in low serum conditions in the presence of nerve growth factor for 12 days . This treatment allows for extensive neurite outgrowth from the cell bodies , as well as separation of somatodendritic and axonal marker proteins [32] . We infected cells with PRV Becker for 12 hours , and subjected lysates to raft flotation analysis as performed previously ( Figure 3 ) . Us9 and gB were again strongly associated with the raft fraction of the gradient , and floated with GM1 . Both gE and gC were highly enriched in the DRM fraction of PC12 cells upon differentiation with NGF . This finding is consistent with the notion that polarization of neurons strongly impacts the affinity and targeting of certain membrane proteins to lipid rafts/DRMs [4] . gH was completely solubilized by TX-100 even in differentiated PC12 cells , and remained in the soluble fraction with TfR . These data suggest that Us9 and gB have a high affinity for DRMs in undifferentiated and differentiated PC12 cells , whereas gC and gE increase their association with DRMs as cells polarize and mature . The efficient targeting of viral structural components to the axon of infected cells is dependent on both the Us9 and gE gene products [15] , [16] , [54] . Deletion of either gene results in the reduction of viral capsids and enveloped proteins in the axon , and subsequent reduction of anterograde spread of infection in vitro and in vivo [11] , [17] , [55] . Upon discovering that both Us9 and gE were present in the DRMs of infected PC12 cells , we tested whether deleting the gE/gI complex affected the ability of Us9 to target to rafts , thereby impacting its ability to function properly in anterograde transport . PC12 cells were infected with PRV 99 , a mutant deleted for the gE and gI genes , and subjected to raft flotation analysis . Deletion of gE/gI had no affect on the ability of Us9 to associate with DRMs ( Figure 4A ) , nor did the absence of gB ( data not shown ) . These data again support the notion that Us9 has an intrinsic affinity for DRMs and is not influenced by cell polarity or the presence of two major viral DRM components . It is noteworthy that we found no aberrant targeting of gB , gC , or gE to DRMs in a Us9-null mutant ( data not shown ) . It is well documented that certain proteins become raft associated upon their phosphorylation during signal transduction [56]\u2013[58] . Us9 contains a conserved acid cluster ( AC ) region with two serines that are phosphorylated [26] , as well as a di-tyrosine motif critical for anterograde , transynaptic spread [26] . To examine whether inhibiting Us9 phosphorylation precluded Us9 association with DRMs , we infected PC12 cells with PRV 162 , a mutant that expresses an altered Us9 protein lacking the acidic cluster region . DRMs were prepared from infected cells as performed previously ( Figure 4B ) . Us9 was still enriched in the DRM fraction of the gradient despite the absence of Us9 phosphorylation ( note the narrowness of the Us9 band compared to wild-type Us9 in panel A ) . Taken together , these data suggest that Us9 is highly enriched in DRMs , and its affinity for this lipid microdomain is not dependent on its phosphorylation state . Both the influenza virus neuraminidase ( NA ) and haemagglutinin ( HA ) proteins ( both type II membrane proteins ) are highly enriched in DRMs/lipid rafts , and this association is critical for the apical sorting of these proteins in polarized MDCK cells [59]\u2013[61] . Importantly , the transmembrane domain ( TMD ) of these proteins provided the determinants for apical sorting and raft association [59] , [62]\u2013[64] . This was demonstrated by swapping the TMD of transferrin receptor ( a type II , non-raft associated membrane protein ) for the TMD of neuraminidase [63] . Transferrin receptor was normally sorted to the basolateral membrane in polarized MDCK cells , and was efficiently solubilized by 1% TX-100 . By contrast , transferrin receptor with the NA TMD was targeted to the apical cell surface and was largely insoluble to treatment with TX-100 [59] . In a reciprocal experiment , the neuraminidase TMD was replaced with the transferrin receptor TMD [62] . This chimeric protein was greatly reduced in lipid raft association , and a virus expressing this protein showed a defect of particle release from the apical cell surface . We employed a similar approach with PRV Us9 to test whether its transmembrane domain provided the determinants for raft sorting . Both Us9 and transferrin receptor are type II membrane proteins , and have 26 amino acids within their TMD . We constructed a PRV mutant that expressed a chimeric protein with the wild-type Us9 cytoplasmic domain , a transferrin receptor TMD , and wild-type 3 amino acid ectodomain ( Figure 5A ) . This mutant , known as PRV 322 , replicates with wild-type kinetics in porcine kidney ( PK15 ) cells . Furthermore , the Us9-TfR protein is abundantly expressed in infected cell lysates and migrates more slowly by SDS-PAGE than wild-type Us9 ( Figure 5C ) . Expression of the upstream and downstream genes , gE and Us2 respectively , were indistinguishable from Becker and suggested that recombination of Us9-TfR into the viral genome did not have polar effects on neighboring genes . Us9-TfR is efficiently incorporated into virions ( Figure 5D ) , along with gE and Us2 , but not UL34 which is a component of primary but not mature virus particles [65] . The localization and intracellular trafficking pattern of Us9 has been studied extensively in porcine kidney ( PK15 ) cells [20] , [26] , [28] . To assess whether Us9-TfR remained a functional Us9 derivative ( i . e . did not have an egregious trafficking defect ) , we examined the steady-state localization of Us9-TfR in transfected and infected PK15 cells . We hypothesized that both Us9 and Us9-TfR would have similar localization patterns as both contain the Us9 acidic domain , the region necessary for localization to a perinuclear cellular compartment [20] . Furthermore , sorting signals for the TfR protein reside in the cytoplasmic tail , not within the transmembrane domain [66] . Thus , the TfR TMD should be functionally inert in the context of Us9 trafficking . The localization of Us9 fused to GFP mimics the localization of wild-type Us9 inside infected cells [20] , [28] . We fused Us9-TfR to GFP to visualize its steady-state level in cells in the absence of infection . Both Us9-GFP and Us9-TfR-GFP were predominantly located to a perinuclear region in the cytoplasm of PK15 cells ( Figure 6A ) . Confocal images of cells infected with Becker and PRV 322 , fixed and stained with Us9 antiserum , also showed co-localization of Us9 and Us9-TfR to a perinuclear compartment , though the Us9-TfR signal was slightly more diffuse compared to the Us9 signal ( Figure 6B ) . Overall , the trafficking of Us9-TfR inside transfected and infected cells was very similar to wild-type Us9 . Next we tested whether the replacement of the wild-type Us9 TMD with that of transferrin receptor affected the affinity of Us9 for DRMs . We infected undifferentiated and differentiated PC12 cells for 12 hours , solubilized cells with 1% TX-100 , and performed flotation analysis as done previously . Instead of Us9 being heavily enriched in the raft fraction as observed in Becker infected cells ( see Figures 2 and 3 ) , Us9-TfR was predominantly found in the soluble fraction , especially in differentiated PC12 cells ( Figure 7A and 7B ) . To assess whether this impacted Us9 function in primary neurons , we took advantage of a trichamber neuronal culturing system [17] , [37] . Dissociated SCG neurons are plated in the soma ( S ) chamber and allowed to mature for two weeks ( Figure 7C ) . During this period , axons are directed between a series of grooves across the methocellulose ( M ) chamber to the neurite ( N ) chamber . A monolayer of indicator PK15 cells are then plated on top of the neurites in the N chamber . Cell bodies in the S chamber are infected , virus particles sort into axons in a Us9-dependent manner , and subsequently infect the PK15 cells that amplify the infection . The initial infection is confined to the S chamber via silicone vacuum grease and a methocellulose barrier . Therefore , infection spreads to the N chamber solely through axons that emanate from neuronal cell bodies and extend to PK15 cells [17] . We compared the anterograde transport and spread capabilities of PRV Becker ( wild-type ) , PRV 160 ( Us9-null ) , PRV 322 ( Us9-TfR ) , and a co-infection of Becker and PRV 322 ( Figure 7C , lower panel ) . Though all of the infections produced a comparable number of infectious virus in the S chamber , spread to second order PK15 cells in the N chamber was dramatically different . PRV Becker spread efficiently from neurons to PK15 cells , producing a median titer of 1 . 2\u00d7107 PFU in the N chamber after 24 hours post-infection ( Figure 7C ) . By contrast , the Us9-null mutant ( PRV 160 ) did not spread to PK15 cells and no detectable infectious virus was produced in most dishes . However , in one dish , we detected a low number of infectious particles ( 1 . 5\u00d7103 ) . We interpret a low yield of amplified virus as a single neuron-to-cell spread event ( the burst size of an infected PK15 cell is roughly 1000 PFU ) . Nevertheless , the neuron-to-cell spread capability of PRV 160 is extremely low compared to wild-type PRV Becker . PRV 322 ( Us9-TfR ) was completely defective in anterograde spread and was indistinguishable from the Us9-null mutant ( no infectious virus detected in the N-compartment ) . This phenotype strongly correlated with the inability of Us9-TfR to target to lipid rafts/DRMs . When neurons were co-infected with both Becker and PRV 322 , titers were virtually identical to those seen with Becker alone , indicating that PRV 322 does not have a trans-dominant effect on anterograde spread of infection . To assess whether the anterograde , neuron-to-cell spread defect for PRV 322 was at the level of axonal sorting of viral structural proteins ( as previously shown for other Us9 mutants [15] , [16] ) , we imaged infected neurons in the trichamber system using a PRV-specific antibody ( made against acetone-fixed virus particles ) that recognizes both virus glycoproteins and virus capsid proteins [21] , [22] . PRV antigen was readily detected in the cell bodies of neurons in the S compartment infected with Becker , PRV 160 , and PRV 322 ( Figure 8 , first column ) . Viral glycoprotein and capsid proteins were also abundant in the axons of Becker infected neurons within the N compartment ( Figure 8 , second column ) . By contrast , no viral structural proteins were observed by immunofluorescence in the axons of a Us9-null mutant ( PRV 160 ) or the Us9-TfR strain ( PRV 322 ) , though an extensive network of axons was observed within the field of views by transmitted brightfield illumination ( Figure 8 , transmitted ) . These data suggest that the neuron-to-cell spread defect observed for PRV 322 ( Figure 7 ) is the result of its inability to sort structural proteins into the axon of infected neurons . Overall , these data are consistent with work done on the raft association of the influenza virus neuraminidase protein: substitution of a TMD domain that has a high affinity for lipid rafts , for one with a low affinity , dramatically alters DRM targeting and subsequent protein function . \n We have demonstrated that Us9 is enriched in detergent-resistant membranes of non-polarized and polarized PC12 cells . This enrichment is cholesterol dependent , and is essential for Us9-mediated anterograde spread of infection in primary SCG neurons . Us9 is responsible for the axonal sorting of viral capsids [15] , as well as the viral glycoproteins gB , gC , and gE [16] . These viral membrane proteins are associated with lipid rafts on the surface of PRV infected swine kidney cells and monocytes , and monospecific antibody-induced patching of one of these proteins led to the copatching of the others [18] . These patches were enriched in the raft marker GM1 , but not transferrin receptor [18] . These findings are consistent with the raft partitioning of these viral glycoproteins in polarized PC12 cells ( Figure 3 ) . In addition , Us9-dependent targeting of viral membrane proteins requires maturation of cultured SCG neurons ( Tomishima and Enquist , unpublished observations ) . Lipid raft formation during neuronal polarization is likely a key step in this sorting process [4] . Taken together , these data support a role for lipid rafts in the axonal sorting of alpha herpesvirus proteins and structures in the mammalian nervous system . PRV gE , which is in a heterodimeric complex with the viral glycoprotein gI [22] , is also necessary for the efficient axonal sorting of PRV structural components [54] . We propose a model in which Us9 , gE/gI , and lipid rafts direct the sorting of vesicles into the axon of infected neurons ( Figure 9 ) . Us9 and gE/gI likely associate with lipid rafts in the trans-Golgi network ( TGN ) , the putative site of viral assembly [20] , [67] , [68] . The presence of Us9 and gE/gI in lipid rafts ( those decorating the surface of cellular vesicles ) would recruit axonal sorting machinery to a small number of viral assembly complexes in the TGN , i . e . vesicles with viral membrane proteins only , those containing mature virus particles , or L-particles ( illustrated as \u201cthree vesicle populations\u201d in Figure 9 ) . A limited number of vesicles containing virion components would then be targeted to the axon . Though a Us9-gE/gI complex in a lipid raft is required for efficient axonal transport , Us9 is clearly the more critical component , and the presence of gE/gI seems to enhance this process [17] . It is noteworthy that Us9/gE/gI are not required for infectious particle formation in the cell body of SCG neurons [16] , [54] , nor for retrograde transport in the mammalian nervous system [11] , [69] . Furthermore , we have not observed the accumulation of viral capsids or membrane proteins in the cell body of a Us9-null , gE/gI-null , or Bartha strain lacking all three genes ( unpublished observations ) . Our findings are consistent with a model in which the virus assembly and axonal sorting compartment within the TGN are identical ( i . e . both processes use the same material for assembly ) . A small number of assembly complexes would bind a sorting adaptor protein ( s ) and go to axons; the majority of assembly complexes would egress the cell body locally , perhaps at sites where axons contact the infected cell body ( Figure 9 ) . What determines whether a vesicle laden with viral structural proteins is directed to the axon as opposed to being released from the cell body ? We propose that phosphorylation of Us9 , subsequent to its recruitment into lipid rafts , may be the pivotal step . The PRV Us9 acidic domain region is heavily phosphorylated during infection [26] , and is essential for anterograde , transneuronal spread in vivo [26] . Phosphorylation occurs predominantly on two serine residues within the 10-amino-acid acidic domain , and mutating these serines to alanines dramatically decreases anterograde spread in the rat visual system [26] . This phosphorylation event would occur after Us9 enters the raft , as the acidic cluster domain is not required for raft association of Us9 ( Figure 4B ) . We are currently investigating whether 1 ) the association of Us9 with lipid rafts coincides with its phosphorylation inside infected cells and 2 ) the phosphorylation state of the Us9-TfR chimera is reduced since it is no longer enriched in lipid rafts . Perhaps not surprisingly , the Us9 acidic domain region is highly conserved among Us9 homologs of other neurotropic herpesviruses , including the human pathogens herpes simplex virus ( HSV ) and varicella zoster virus ( VZV ) , as well as the animal pathogens equine herpesvirus ( EHV ) and bovine herpesvirus ( BHV ) , suggesting an important role for this domain in the anterograde spread of virus in the mammalian nervous system [26] , [70]\u2013[72] . We predict that phosphorylation of the Us9 acidic domain ( within the context of a lipid raft ) is necessary for binding an axonal sorting adaptor , which would then mediate anterograde transport inside the axon [16] , [73] . Our model addresses how viral glycoproteins/vesicles are sorted into the axon of infected neurons , but does not suggest a mechanism for their function in cell-to-cell spread of infection in cultured epithelial cells [74]\u2013[76] . It may be that these two processes are fundamentally different since 1 ) gE mutants with a small-plaque phenotype on MDBK cells have wild-type anterograde spread kinetics in the rat visual system [77] , 2 ) deletion of PRV Us9 has no effect on cell-to-cell spread of infection in epithelial cells , but a dramatic impact on anterograde sorting [11] , and 3 ) gB mutants with a small-plaque phenotype on ST cells [78] have wild-type anterograde neuron-to-cell spread kinetics in our trichamber system ( Curanovic and Enquist , unpublished findings ) . It was intriguing to discover that PRV gH was not associated with detergent-resistant membranes in non-polarized and polarized PC12 cells , and was completely solubilized with 1% TX-100 ( as was the non-raft marker transferrin receptor ) . The virus fusion machinery is composed of gB trimers , as well as gH/gL heterodimeric complexes ( reviewed in [79] ) . PRV gH is essential for entry into uninfected cells , cell-to-cell spread of infection in tissue culture [80] , and transneuronal spread of infection in mice [81] . Does gH enter the axon in a Us9 or gE-dependent manner despite its apparent exclusion from DRMs ? We are currently investigating this question . Cross-linking experiments performed on purified HSV virions found that hetero-oligomers of gB , gC , and gD were closely associated with one another in the virion envelope ( within 11 . 4\u00c5 ) . The gH and gL proteins could also be cross-linked within the envelope as one might predict . Interestingly , gL was never cross-linked to gB , leading the authors to suggest that organization of these proteins in the membrane \u201cprecludes associations of gH/gL with gB\u201d [82] . One explanation for this finding is that gB is present in a lipid raft microdomain , whereas gH is not ( a small proportion of HSV gH has been shown to be in the DRM fraction of infected COS cells [83] ) . It is also feasible that PRV gH may indeed be raft-associated , but solubilization with cold detergent is too stringent . Triton X-100 and CHAPS are reported to be the most reliable detergents for analyzing raft association [84] . However , some membrane proteins solubilized by Triton X-100 do associate with lipid rafts by antibody copatching [18] , [51] , [85] , [86] . At this time it is unclear if gH has a weak affinity for rafts , or is indeed a \u201ctrue\u201d non-raft protein as is transferrin receptor . Our findings also highlight the importance of the Us9 TMD domain in raft targeting . Several studies have addressed the importance of the transmembrane segment in partitioning viral and cellular membrane proteins into lipid rafts: influenza virus hemagglutinin [60] , [64] and neuraminidase [59] , [63] , the LMP-1 oncoprotein of Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) [87] , and the human immunoreceptor Fc\u03b3RIIA [88] . It is clear from these studies that amino acids within the TMD ( even single amino acids ) have dramatic effects on raft partitioning , sorting , or signaling events . A comprehensive analysis of the Us9 TMD may reveal residues important for protein-lipid/protein-protein interactions that are key in promoting axonal sorting of mature virus particles . Several alpha herpesvirus proteins have been shown to associate with DRMs during virus replication . In addition to PRV membrane proteins ( [18]; this study ) the virion host shutoff ( vhs ) protein of HSV-1 was shown to be enriched in organellar membrane fractions which contain virus assembly intermediates [83] . HSV gB is proposed to mobilize lipid rafts during entry , perhaps to mediate cell signaling [81] . The UL11 protein of HSV-2 , a myristoyl and palmitoyl tegument protein , associated with DRMs of infected Caco-2 cells [89] . The UL56 protein of HSV-2 , a tail-anchored type II membrane similar to PRV Us9 , was present in detergent-insoluble lipid rafts; it is predicted to be involved in vesicular trafficking in HSV-2 infected cells [90] . These findings demonstrate that lipid rafts play an important role in the replication cycle of alpha herpesviruses , and underscore the importance of lipid rafts in virus biology [91]\u2013[94] . Two competing models have been presented for anterograde , axonal transport of alpha herpesviruses in neurons ( reviewed in [95] ) . Viral capsids are either transported down the axon independently from viral membrane proteins ( and assemble prior to egress ) , or they are sorted and transported together as a mature virus particle within a vesicle . Recent studies have shown that efficient capsid transport is dependent on at least two viral membrane proteins , Us9 and gE . Deleting either of these genes from HSV or PRV results in a marked decrease of viral capsids from entering axons of infected neurons [12] , [15] , [54] , [96] . It is difficult to conceive how viral membrane proteins could impact capsid sorting unless the two were tightly coupled during axonal entry and transport ( i . e . if capsids entered axons separate from viral membrane proteins , deletion of gE and Us9 would have no effect on capsid sorting ) . These recent findings are consistent with a model where viral capsids and membrane proteins traffic together in axons as mature virus particles ( within a vesicle ) ( Figure 9 ) . In conclusion , we have shown that PRV Us9 is highly enriched in DRMs of non-polarized and polarized PC12 cells , and this enrichment is critical to axonal targeting and subsequently in neuron-to-cell spread . This is the first report to implicate lipid rafts in the axonal sorting of alpha herpesvirus structural proteins in mammalian neurons . Our future plans include isolating lipid rafts from polarized PC12 cells infected with wild-type PRV , and identifying the cellular and viral proteins present within these lipid microdomains .", "headings": ["Abstract", "Introduction", "Materials and Methods", "Results", "Discussion"], "keywords": ["virology/virion structure, assembly, and egress", "biochemistry/cell signaling and trafficking structures", "cell biology/neuronal signaling mechanisms"], "id": "journal.ppat.1000065"}
{"lay_summary": "Nongenetic heterogeneity exists when a trait differs among individuals that have identical genotypes and environments . A clonal population can maximize its long-term success in an uncertain environment by diversifying its phenotypes via nongenetic heterogeneity: the currently unfavored ones may become the favored ones when conditions change . Nongenetic heterogeneity has clinical relevance . For example , populations of tumor cells or infectious microbes show cell-to-cell differences in growth and in drug or stress tolerance . This heterogeneity hampers efficient treatment and can potentiate harmful evolution of a tumor or pathogen . We show that in budding yeast , heterogeneity in intracellular cyclic AMP levels acting through the conserved Ras/cAMP/protein kinase A ( PKA ) pathway and its target transcription factors , Msn2 and Msn4 , underlies the nongenetic heterogeneity of both single-cell growth rate and acute heat-stress tolerance . Perturbations of this pathway significantly affect population survival upon acute heat stress . These results illuminate a mechanism of nongenetic heterogeneity and suggest the potential value of antitumor or antifungal treatment strategies that target nongenetic heterogeneity to render the tumor or pathogen population more uniformly susceptible to a second drug that aims to kill .", "article": "Genetically identical cells exhibit extensive phenotypic variation even under constant and benign conditions . This so-called nongenetic heterogeneity has important clinical implications: within tumors and microbial infections , cells show nongenetic heterogeneity in growth rate and in susceptibility to drugs or stress . The budding yeast , Saccharomyces cerevisiae , shows a similar form of nongenetic heterogeneity in which growth rate correlates positively with susceptibility to acute heat stress at the single-cell level . Using genetic and chemical perturbations , combined with high-throughput single-cell assays of yeast growth and gene expression , we show here that heterogeneity in intracellular cyclic AMP ( cAMP ) levels acting through the conserved Ras/cAMP/protein kinase A ( PKA ) pathway and its target transcription factors , Msn2 and Msn4 , underlies this nongenetic heterogeneity . Lower levels of cAMP correspond to slower growth , as shown by direct comparison of cAMP concentration in subpopulations enriched for slower vs . faster growing cells . Concordantly , an endogenous reporter of this pathway\u2019s activity correlates with growth in individual cells . The paralogs Msn2 and Msn4 differ in their roles in nongenetic heterogeneity in a way that demonstrates slow growth and stress tolerance are not inevitably linked . Heterogeneity in growth rate requires each , whereas only Msn2 is required for heterogeneity in expression of Tsl1 , a subunit of trehalose synthase that contributes to acute-stress tolerance . Perturbing nongenetic heterogeneity by mutating genes in this pathway , or by culturing wild-type cells with the cell-permeable cAMP analog 8-bromo-cAMP or the PKA inhibitor H89 , significantly impacts survival of acute heat stress . Perturbations that increase intracellular cAMP levels reduce the slower-growing subpopulation and increase susceptibility to acute heat stress , whereas PKA inhibition slows growth and decreases susceptibility to acute heat stress . Loss of Msn2 reduces , but does not completely eliminate , the correlation in individual cells between growth rate and acute-stress survival , suggesting a major role for the Msn2 pathway in nongenetic heterogeneity but also a residual benefit of slow growth . Our results shed light on the genetic control of nongenetic heterogeneity and suggest a possible means of defeating bet-hedging pathogens or tumor cells by making them more uniformly susceptible to treatment . \n For any particular trait , genetically identical individuals raised in identical environments may still differ . This phenomenon is termed phenotypic variability or nongenetic heterogeneity [1] . Examples of nongenetic heterogeneity include clonal microbial cultures in which cells differ in gene activity , growth and tolerance of stress or drug treatments [2\u20138] . Tumor cells also display nongenetic heterogeneity in gene expression , growth and chemotherapy tolerance [9\u201314] . Nongenetic heterogeneity of traits important for growth and survival would reduce fitness in a constant environment but can provide an evolutionary advantage when conditions fluctuate unpredictably , by enabling a clonal population to hedge its bets [3 , 4 , 14\u201316] or to explore and persist in unfamiliar niches as a precursor to genetic adaptation [11 , 13 , 17 , 18] . In general , the molecular mechanisms that generate nongenetic heterogeneity are poorly understood [1] . Elucidating these mechanisms is an important goal because it can advance our understanding of how populations\u2014including populations of pathogens or cancer cells\u2014adapt to complex , changing environments . We previously described a putative bet-hedging system in the budding yeast , Saccharomyces cerevisiae [3] . S . cerevisiae is not only a powerful model organism that has yielded key insights into cancer [19\u201321] and the evolution of clonal lineages [22\u201324] , but is also an opportunistic pathogen [25\u201328] . Time-lapse microscopy of microcolonies founded by individual yeast cells revealed that genetically identical cells grown in the same , benign conditions have a wide range of cell-division rates and differ in their tolerance of acute heat stress [3] . Here we use the term \u201cacute\u201d to emphasize that the stress is sufficiently strong and sudden as to require cells to be prepared in advance rather than to mount a stress response to survive . Growth and acute stress tolerance are negatively correlated: slower-growing cells , which are at a disadvantage under benign conditions , disproportionally survive acute heat stress [3] . Slow growth and high stress tolerance also correlate at the single-cell level with high expression of the protein Tsl1 , a component of the trehalose-synthase complex [3] . Stress induces production of Tsl1 and of trehalose , which preserves protein folding and acts as a storage carbohydrate [29 , 30] . Under benign conditions , most cells express very little Tsl1 , but some express much more [3] . Synthesis of trehalose in the latter cells could prepare them to withstand acute stress , and indeed a tsl1-deleted strain survives acute heat stress poorly compared with an isogenic wild-type strain [3] . Although a connection between slow growth and stress tolerance has been observed in several systems [4 , 14 , 31 , 32] , the two are not inextricably linked , as the tsl1 deletion does not appreciably alter the distribution of microcolony growth rates [3] . The variability of microcolony growth rates differs between natural isolates of budding yeast [6 , 33] , implying both that there is a genetic basis of differences in nongenetic heterogeneity and that it is likely an ecologically relevant phenomenon . We therefore sought to elucidate the molecular mechanism that generates nongenetic heterogeneity in yeast-cell growth and acute stress tolerance . Our starting point was the regulation of TSL1 . We reasoned that a regulatory pathway controlling cell-to-cell differences in TSL1 expression would be an excellent candidate for coordinately controlling the nongenetic heterogeneity of growth and acute stress tolerance . TSL1 induction by stress is directly controlled by the paralogous transcription factors Msn2 and Msn4 , which regulate it and other stress-response genes through stress-response ( STRE ) elements in their cis-regulatory regions [34\u201336] . The activities of Msn2 and Msn4 are controlled by intracellular cyclic AMP ( cAMP ) levels via the well-studied Ras/cAMP/protein kinase A ( PKA ) pathway [37 , 38] ( Fig 1 ) . Intracellular cAMP levels are set by the balance between the adenylyl cyclase Cyr1 and the phosphodiesterases Pde1 , which has low cAMP affinity , and Pde2 , which has high cAMP affinity [39 , 40] . The Ras proteins Ras1 and Ras2 are GTPases that can exist in GTP-bound and GDP-bound forms . In benign conditions with an abundance of the preferred carbon source , glucose , the GTP-bound form predominates . Under glucose starvation , the GTPase-activating proteins ( GAPs ) Ira1 and Ira2 stimulate the GTPase activity of Ras , causing a shift to the GDP-bound form . In its GTP-bound form , but not in its GDP-bound form , Ras stimulates Cyr1 , causing cAMP levels to increase [41] . cAMP binds to Bcy1 , the regulatory subunit of PKA , relieving an inhibitory association of Bcy1 with the catalytic subunit of PKA , encoded by one of three genes , TPK1 , TPK2 and TPK3 . Deleting all three TPK genes is lethal , whereas deleting any one alone or any pair is not , implying redundancy [41] . However , substrate specificities of Tpk1 , Tpk2 and Tpk3 do not completely overlap , and traits are known ( including trehalose metabolism ) for which the effects of deleting one TPK gene differ from the effects of deleting another , so redundancy is not absolute [42\u201344] . PKA phosphorylates Msn2 and Msn4 , as well as other targets . PKA phosphorylates Msn2 at both its nuclear localization signal ( NLS ) and its nuclear export signal ( NES ) , decreasing nuclear import and increasing nuclear export and thereby biasing Msn2 localization toward the cytoplasm [38 , 45 , 46] . PKA activity is opposed by protein phosphatase I , so when PKA activity is low , the NLS and NES of Msn2 are unphosphorylated and Msn2 localization is biased toward the nucleus , where it activates transcription of target genes [46\u201348] . Under severe glucose limitation , Msn2 spends more time in the nucleus but does not simply stay there . Instead , the Msn2 molecules within a cell show concerted movements in and out of the nucleus on a timescale of minutes , suggesting that PKA activity itself fluctuates even under constant conditions [46] . Msn4 is thought to behave similarly to Msn2 , but the relationship between phosphorylation status and subcellular localization of Msn4 is not identical to that of Msn2 [38 , 45] . MSN2 and MSN4 are partially redundant . MSN2 is constitutively expressed , whereas MSN4 is induced by stress ( in an Msn2-dependent manner ) [36] , and the regulation of some target genes is dominated by one or the other [49] . Whereas the above-described pathway by which glucose starvation activates Msn2 and Msn4 is well known , the mechanism by which heat stress activates Msn2 and Msn4 is unknown [41 , 50] . As glucose starvation does , heat stress leads to greater nuclear residency of Msn2 and Msn4 , but this effect of heat stress is accompanied by Msn2 and Msn4 hyperphosphorylation , which can be blocked by addition of cAMP [51] . This result implies that sensing of heat stress does not go through PKA but instead involves other kinases [51] . Nonetheless , because Msn2 and Msn4 targets are implicated in protecting cells against a variety of environmental stresses , including nutrient starvation and heat shock [36] , it could be that PKA is relevant to variability in survival of cells shifted from benign conditions to acute heat stress . That is , even though PKA does not transmit the signal of heat stress , cell-to-cell heterogeneity in PKA activity before acute heat stress could determine survival of such stress . The possibility that fluctuations in PKA activity induce heterogeneity in Msn2 activity among unstressed cells that in turn creates heterogeneity in susceptibility to acute stress has been raised based on single-cell RNA sequencing of unstressed cells , which showed that a subset of unstressed cells had mildly activated Msn2-target genes; consistent with this observation , monitoring of cells under benign conditions for 80 min revealed a subset of cells in which Msn2 showed a peak of nuclear localization [52] . Further support for this possibility comes from a study that measured correlations between proteins in their variability across cells [53] . Specifically , genes encoding proteins that co-vary in expression across cells with the protein product of PGM2 , a known target of Msn2 and Msn4 , are highly enriched for STRE elements in their cis-regulatory regions; TSL1 is one of these genes as are other stress-response genes [53] . Changing the gene dosage of Ras/cAMP/PKA pathway members , including Pde2 , Ras2 and Ira2 , alters the covariances between targets , suggesting that the Ras/cAMP/PKA pathway coordinates the heterogeneous expression of these targets [53] . Our hypothesis , therefore , is that under benign , glucose-replete conditions , cell-to-cell variability exists at some level in the Ras/cAMP/PKA pathway , and that this variability translates into variability in Msn2 and Msn4 activity and therefore variability in stress tolerance and growth rate . The variability in stress tolerance would come from variable expression of stress-response genes downstream of Msn2 or Msn4 , such as TSL1 . The mechanistic source of variability in growth rate is less clear , but might derive from the roles of Msn2 and Msn4 in entry into or exit from quiescence [41 , 54 , 55] . Here , we present tests of our hypothesis using genetic analysis of the Ras/cAMP/PKA pathway in combination with single-cell assays of cell growth , gene expression and stress tolerance . When testing our hypothesis , it was important to consider two possible alternative sources of variability in growth and stress tolerance: 1 ) so-called petite cells , which are deficient in respiration , and 2 ) DNA damage . Petite cells grow slowly , but do not represent nongenetic heterogeneity in that they result from mutations in the mitochondrial genome , complete loss of the mitochondrial genome , or mutations in nuclear genes encoding mitochondrial proteins [56\u201358] . Because petite cells also exhibit increased tolerance of some stresses , including heat shock [59\u201361] , they could easily be confused with the slower-growing , stress-tolerant cells we aim to study [3] . The proportion of petites within a population varies considerably depending on strain genotype , ranging from 0 . 5% to 76% [62] . Even the same strain cultivated under identical conditions could have a large variance in petite frequency across experimental replicates [62] , so petites add noise to measurements of growth-rate heterogeneity . For these reasons , we identified petite cells and excluded them from our analysis by integrating into the time-lapse microscopy assay the use of MitoTracker Red CMXRos , a non-toxic dye that differentially stains cells based on their mitochondrial inner membrane potentials [63] . We also created a rho0 petite strain in the genetic background used for our experiments , to serve as a control . rho0 petites have complete loss of the mitochondrial genome , are a common type of petite produced during normal cell division , and are indeed the final state of most petite lineages that start out with mitochondrial-genome mutations [64 , 65] . DNA damage is the second possible alternative source of variability because it can both arrest growth and induce a stress response . Spontaneous DNA damage , such as base modification , base loss and strand breaks , happens during normal cell division [66\u201368] . Upon sensing DNA damage or replication-fork stalling , cells activate specific repair pathways to fix the corresponding problem [66 , 68 , 69] . In addition , a general DNA damage response ( DDR ) is activated to pause the current cell cycle [69\u201372] , which would manifest as a slow-growing phenotype over the period of the DNA-damage repair process . Two lines of evidence have suggested that DNA damage contributes to differences in growth and stress tolerance . First , S . cerevisiae cells with fewer divisions within a 4-h window have increased stress-response gene expression levels and a higher rate of formation of Rad52 foci , which indicate active double-strand break repair [73] . Cells within the top quartile of Rad52-GFP signal intensities show , on average , delayed division over the subsequent 45 min compared with the rest of the population [73] . However , this difference disappears after 2 h [73] , and therefore might not be relevant to the heterogeneity in microcolony growth rates we observe , which persists through 10 h or more [3] . Second , spontaneous DNA damage can trigger entry into a so-called persister state , characterized by growth arrest and increased tolerance against various stresses [74] . However , persisters make up a very small fraction of the population ( approximately 0 . 1% ) and less than a quarter of them show sustained growth arrest for more than 5 h [74] , so they do not appear to explain the nongenetic heterogeneity we observe , which involves a much larger subpopulation of cells that sustain slow growth over longer time periods . Therefore , although DNA damage impacts growth and stress tolerance , it is unlikely to explain the heterogeneity of growth rate and stress tolerance we observe . Nonetheless , we directly tested whether the DDR explains growth and stress-tolerance heterogeneity in our conditions . To do this , we used a protein fusion of GFP and Rnr3 , an isoform of the large subunit of ribonucleotide reductase that is strongly induced as part of the DDR , independently of cell-cycle stage [75\u201377] . Further motivating our controls for petites and the DDR are known connections between petites and both DNA damage and the Ras/cAMP/PKA pathway . The existence of petites was neither monitored nor controlled for in the prior yeast studies examining DNA damage , growth and stress tolerance [73 , 74] . However , petites could have been a major factor; for example , petites that have mutations in the gene encoding the mitochondrial protein frataxin induce a strong DDR because of increased genome instability [78] . The Ras/cAMP/PKA pathway has been reported to regulate mitochondrial biogenesis , enzyme content and chaperone expression [79\u201382] . pde2 and ira2 mutations have been reported to be petite-negative , meaning that petites cannot survive in the absence of these genes [83] . However , the exact mechanism explaining why petites cannot survive without Pde2 or Ira2 is not clear . In this study , we separate nongenetic heterogeneity of growth rate and stress tolerance from petite formation and the DDR , and establish that the Ras/cAMP/PKA pathway , acting through Msn2 and Msn4 , indeed regulates this nongenetic heterogeneity . This work not only contributes to our basic understanding of nongenetic heterogeneity but also points to an approach to defeating a bet-hedging strategy: increasing cAMP levels by administering a cAMP analog reduces the slower-growing fraction of the population and renders the population more susceptible to acute stress . This type of one-two punch might provide a useful treatment approach in cases where slow-growing subpopulations of pathogens or tumor cells cause relapse . \n We measured cell-growth heterogeneity within isogenic yeast populations using a previously established high-throughput microcolony growth-rate assay [3 , 6 , 33 , 84] ( Fig 2A ) . In brief , exponentially growing cell cultures are harvested at a density of ~106 cells/ml ( early log phase ) , diluted into fresh liquid medium so that ~4000 individual founder cells are dispensed per well of a concanavalin A-coated 96-well glass-bottom plate , then followed through time-lapse microscopy to capture changes in microcolony area over 10 h ( see Methods ) . Concanavalin A is a lectin to which yeast cells adhere , so it causes cells to form discrete , monolayer microcolonies on the glass through the course of the experiment , despite being in liquid medium [3] . The typical microcolony growth-rate distribution for a wild-type , haploid strain of S . cerevisiae has a prominent peak of fast growth and a heavy left tail of slower-growing microcolonies , as shown in Fig 2B for the prototrophic haploid strain FY4 [85] . We used a prototrophic strain background , and when possible , clean genetic manipulations that leave no selectable markers in the genome ( see Methods ) , because this assay is sensitive enough to detect growth differences between otherwise isogenic strains that differ only in which auxotrophic mutations they contain , even in rich medium that ostensibly renders the auxotrophies irrelevant [3] . The slower-growing tail of the microcolony growth-rate distribution might contain petites . To investigate this possibility and develop a means of excluding petites from our analyses , we cultured cells with MitoTracker Red CMXRos ( hereafter called MitoTracker ) , a red-fluorescent dye that accumulates in actively respiring mitochondria , and analyzed red fluorescence at the first time point of microcolony growth ( see Methods ) . To test the efficacy of this dye , we performed the microcolony growth-rate assay on FY4 cells , as well as on a rho0 petite strain derived from FY4 ( see Methods ) , with and without MitoTracker . Under our conditions , MitoTracker does not alter growth of yeast cells , as the FY4 strain showed virtually indistinguishable growth-rate distributions with and without MitoTracker , as did the rho0 petite strain ( Fig 2B ) . As expected , the rho0 strain had a lower mean growth rate than FY4 , and its growth-rate distribution overlaps substantially with the left tail of the FY4 distribution ( Fig 2B ) , suggesting that exclusion of petites is important for our analysis . To exclude petites , we used fluorescence intensities of MitoTracker staining of rho0 petite microcolonies to determine a threshold under which to remove microcolonies from analyses of other strains on the same experimental plate . Most rho0 petite microcolonies have very low MitoTracker intensities relative to most FY4 microcolonies ( Fig 2A ) , but a small proportion of rho0 petite microcolonies have high MitoTracker intensities , perhaps because they are mutants with increased mitochondrial inner-membrane potential . For FY4 , a small proportion of microcolonies have low MitoTracker intensities and reduced growth rates , which overlap with the majority of the rho0 petite population . The remaining FY4 microcolonies have relatively high MitoTracker intensities , but there is a small positive correlation with growth rate; although slower-growing cells are therefore more likely to have comparatively low MitoTracker staining , this staining is still higher than that of most of the petite cells ( Fig 3A ) . Because the MitoTracker staining levels of FY4 cells and the rho0 petites overlap and because there is a slight positive correlation between MitoTracker staining and growth rate , the decision of where to set a stain-intensity threshold for excluding petites is critical . If the threshold is too low , it will not sufficiently filter out petite cells , whereas if it is too high , it could filter out slow growers in a biased way . To assess how different thresholds alter the apparent non-petite growth-rate distribution , we used the medcouple , a measure of the skewness of a distribution that is robust against outliers and is location- and scale-invariant [86] . For subsequent comparisons of non-petite growth-rate distributions between different genotypes or conditions , an added advantage of the medcouple is that its values can be compared statistically with a Z-test [86] . We calculated the medcouple across a wide range of thresholds . The medcouple should be negative when there is a skew to the left ( i . e . , a heavier tail of slower-growing cells than of faster-growing cells ) . We reasoned that , when a threshold is low and located in the range of petite intensities , increasing the threshold would increase the medcouple by preferentially removing petite cells and thereby reducing the left tail . Likewise , when a threshold is high and located in the range of normal-cell intensities , increasing the threshold would also increase the medcouple by disproportionately removing slower-growing cells because of the positive correlation between MitoTracker intensity and growth rate , which is especially evident in the growth-rate range between 0 . 3 and 0 . 4 h\u20131 ( Fig 3A ) . Between these two phases of increasing medcouples should lie a plateau of medcouples corresponding to thresholds that filter out most petites yet do not disproportionately remove many slower-growing non-petites . In plots of medcouples against corresponding MitoTracker-intensity thresholds that span a wide range , the three phases appear as expected ( Fig 3B ) . Removing petite microcolonies by setting the threshold in the center of the middle plateau phase , as expected , reduces the left tail of the growth-rate distribution but , also as expected , the distribution does remain asymmetric , with a substantial fraction of slower-growing cells ( Fig 3C ) . Unless otherwise specified , all microcolony growth-rate analyses below used this MitoTracker approach to exclude petites . When multiple strains or conditions were assayed in the same experimental replicate , appropriate thresholds were calculated for each strain separately , then a single threshold was set for the entire replicate by taking the mean value of these thresholds . To confirm the robustness of any conclusions we drew , we repeated all analyses using thresholds set at 90% or 110% of the originally selected common threshold . We also repeated all analyses using the separate strain- or condition-specific thresholds rather than a common threshold , in case threshold differences reflect actual biological differences between strains or conditions in MitoTracker staining rather than experimental noise . Results were consistent across analyses with these different thresholds , so for simplicity of presentation we report below the results of using the threshold corresponding to the mean of the plateau centers of each strain or condition . To test the possible relationship between DNA damage and slow growth , we used a strain carrying two reporter genes encoding fluorescent-protein fusions: HSP12-mCherry and RNR3-GFP . HSP12 is induced by environmental stresses and by DNA damage , and has been proposed to be a marker of yeast persister cells [74] . Hsp12 expression highly correlates with that of Tsl1 , and both HSP12 and TSL1 are targets of Msn2 [53 , 74] . RNR3 is induced as part of the DDR and is not a target of Msn2 [35 , 74] . We first tested whether Hsp12 behaves similarly to Tsl1 in growing microcolonies and indeed it does . We cultured the dual-reporter strain to early-log phase and measured mCherry intensity and growth in microcolonies . As is seen with a Tsl1 reporter [3] ( and this study; see below ) , Hsp12-mCherry expression correlates negatively with microcolony growth rate ( S1A Fig ) . The negative relationship between growth and Hsp12 ( or Tsl1 ) expression might be caused by DNA damage or by something else , such as DNA damage-independent regulation of growth and expression by Msn2 . We therefore next tested more specifically how the DDR correlates with differences in growth rate . We performed this test by collecting fractions of cells with different expression levels of the DDR reporter Rnr3-GFP and measuring the distributions of their microcolony growth rates . We did not measure Rnr3-GFP fluorescence on the microscope the same way as we did for Tsl1 and Hsp12 , because Rnr3 signal is not detectable in cells from early log-phase culture . Instead , we used fluorescence-activated cell sorting ( FACS ) to sort the early log-phase population according to the fluorescence intensity of Rnr3-GFP . A quantile-quantile plot ( S1B Fig ) comparing the fluorescence-intensity distribution of Rnr3-GFP to that of FY4 ( serving as a no-GFP control ) shows two deviations from identity: 1 ) the plot is parallel to the null-expectation diagonal except for an upward shift for Rnr3-GFP , suggesting that Rnr3-GFP has a basal level of fluorescence possibly caused by leaky expression; and 2 ) the plot shows an extended tail of very intense Rnr3-GFP cells , which we infer to have activated the DDR . Linear regression of Rnr3-GFP quantiles on control FY4 quantiles , using data from the 10% to 25% quantiles , where the plot appears largely parallel to the diagonal , yields a slope near one ( 1 . 016 ) , suggesting that indeed the Rnr3-GFP fluorescence distribution overlaps with that of the no-GFP control , when correcting for putative leaky expression and excluding the high-expressing tail . We stringently extracted DDR-activated cells by gating at a fluorescence intensity that selects the most intense ~0 . 2% of the total population . This top 0 . 2% bin shows a significant increase in slower-growing cells ( medcouple Z-test P = 1 . 75 X 10\u221242 ) but this increase is more than offset by a shift in the mode of the growth-rate distribution toward faster growth ( S1C Fig ) , consistent with the previous finding that cells with high Rad52-GFP signal intensities show slower division times on average than those with low Rad52-GFP signal intensities when assayed in a short time window ( 45 min ) but not after 2 h [73] . The increase in slower-growing cells suggests that DNA damage does cause some cells to arrest growth over a relatively long time-frame of several hours , which is consistent with the finding that some high-Hsp12 , slow-growing \u201cpersisters\u201d have long-lived Rad52 foci [74] . However , our results imply that DNA damage does not make a meaningful contribution to the broad slower-growing tail of the typical wild-type growth-rate distribution , because cells whose growth is slowed in an enduring way by DNA damage make up such a small minority of the population ( much less than 0 . 1% ) . Moreover , this minority subpopulation might be even smaller than it appears: it likely contains petites because respiration-deficient cells have higher genome instability [78]; we could not use MitoTracker to exclude petites in this experiment because Hsp12-mCherry signal would interfere . To rule out the possibility that a less stringent FACS gating would yield different results , we repeated the Rnr3-GFP sorting experiment with GFP-intensity gates set to capture different bins of GFP intensity ( with 0% being the most intense ) : 0\u20132% , 5\u20137% , 10\u201312% and 20\u201325% . We chose 20\u201325% as the lowest bin because cells within the 20\u201325% bin show no evidence of having activated the DDR: as indicated in S1B Fig , the 20\u201325% bin is located within the region where the quantile-quantile plot coincides with the linear-regression line . The 0\u20132% bin behaves similarly to the 0\u20130 . 2% bin , in that it shows an increase in the slower-growing tail as well as an increase in the mode of the growth-rate distribution , whereas the growth-rate distributions of the remaining bins are very similar in shape to that of the ungated population but have modes that exceed or equal that of the ungated population ( S1D Fig ) . The results with different Rnr3-GFP intensity gates therefore support the original conclusion that DNA damage does not explain the existence of the broad slower-growing tail of the wild-type growth-rate distribution . Correspondingly , we conclude that the negative correlation between growth and Hsp12 ( or Tsl1 ) expression is largely independent of DNA damage . To test the role of the Ras/cAMP/PKA pathway in nongenetic heterogeneity of growth rate , we first performed genetic and chemical manipulations that increase intracellular cAMP levels . Intracellular cAMP levels can be increased by ira2 or pde2 loss-of-function mutations [87 , 88] , or by directly providing cAMP in the culture medium in the form of 8-bromo-cAMP , a cell-permeable cAMP analog that has higher resistance to phosphodiesterase activity [89] . We compared the growth-rate distribution of the wild-type FY4 strain with that of FY4 cultured in the presence of 15 mM 8-bromo-cAMP and with those of FY4-derived strains with pde2 or ira2 deletions ( Fig 4A ) . 8-bromo-cAMP significantly increases the population mean growth rate ( 0 . 424 h\u20131 without 8-bromo-cAMP vs . 0 . 448 h\u20131 with 8-bromo-cAMP , Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test , P < 2 . 2 X 10\u221216 ) , and reduces the abundance of slower-growing cells ( less left skew , medcouple Z-test P = 4 . 52 X 10\u22124 ) . As 8-bromo-cAMP does , the ira2 mutation renders the growth-rate distribution less skewed ( medcouple Z-test P = 1 . 27 X 10\u221210 ) . However , relative to FY4 cells ira2 cells grow much slower on average ( 0 . 356 h\u20131 , Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test , P < 2 . 2 X 10\u221216 ) . This decrease in mean growth rate might be caused by the cAMP-independent requirement for Ira2 in glycerophosphoinositol production and transport [90] . Relative to FY4 the mean growth rate of the pde2-mutant strain is higher ( 0 . 437 h\u20131 , Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test , P < 2 . 2 X 10\u221216 ) . The shape of the left tail of the pde2-mutant growth-rate distribution is also altered relative to FY4 . As shown in Fig 4A , the pde2 mutant has a reduced abundance of the slowest-growing cells but also an increased abundance of cells with intermediate growth rate ( i . e . , the distribution has a heavy shoulder in that its cumulative density curve has a more gentle slope than that of FY4 in the range of growth rates between 0 . 4 and 0 . 5 ) . This altered shape results in a nonsignificant difference in medcouple between FY4 and pde2 mutant ( medcouple Z-test P = 0 . 492 ) . It is unclear why the shape of the growth-rate distribution differs between the addition of 8-bromo-cAMP and the pde2 deletion , although we note that the effects of pde2 deletion appear to be sensitive to the exact nature of the deletion , suggesting that mutations might have differential effects on local chromatin structure and neighboring gene activity . Specifically , it was previously reported that pde2-deletion mutants cannot survive as petites [83]; when we deleted pde2 in a similar way to this previous study by replacing the gene with a selectable marker we found the same result , but when we subsequently removed the marker sequences to leave a clean deletion we found that petites can form . Thus , our attempt at the most precise control ( clean deletion without marker sequences ) might have produced an artifactual result . To test the role of the Ras/cAMP/PKA pathway in nongenetic heterogeneity of Tsl1 expression we measured fluorescence intensity of a Tsl1-GFP fusion protein during microcolony growth of FY4 , FY4 cultured with 15 mM 8-bromo-cAMP , and the FY4-derived pde2-deletion mutant . The wild-type strain encoding the Tsl1-GFP fusion protein showed the expected negative correlation between microcolony growth rate and Tsl1-GFP fluorescence intensity [3] ( Fig 4B , S2 Fig ) . In striking contrast , for both FY4 cultured with 8-bromo-cAMP and the pde2 mutant , across growth rates Tsl1-GFP fluorescence was at close to baseline levels . That is , these manipulations that increase intracellular cAMP levels largely abolished heterogeneous Tsl1 expression and they did so by reducing expression in the slower-growing cells ( rather than by increasing expression in the faster-growing cells ) . The data presented in Fig 3A and Fig 4B ( and S2B Fig ) provide additional confirmation that our MitoTracker-based identification of petites is indeed removing the confounding effect of petites . As noted above , elimination of petites by MitoTracker staining , although effective , is not perfect . In Fig 3A , the proportion of microcolonies in the wild-type FY4 population that fall below the MitoTracker threshold is 12 . 45% and the proportion of microcolonies in the FY4 rho0 petite population that exceed the MitoTracker threshold ( which was set based solely on the wild-type FY4 population\u2019s data ) is 21 . 79% . We can estimate the extent to which petites contaminate the after-thresholding wild-type FY4 data set by assuming that the proportion of such contaminating petites ( relative to the total number of petites ) matches the proportion of FY4 rho0 petites that exceed the MitoTracker threshold . Thus , the estimated total petite frequency is 15 . 92% and the estimated amount of contamination of the after-threshold data by petites is 3 . 96% . This estimate of contamination is likely an over-estimate because: 1 ) the competitive disadvantage of rho0 petites is known to be suppressible by mutations that increase inner-membrane potential [91] , and rho0 petites have genome instability and therefore increased mutation rate [65]; and 2 ) the MitoTracker threshold was set without using the FY4 rho0 data . On this latter point , we note that we have found that including rho0 data in the threshold calculation increases the calculated threshold , so that the proportion of rho0 microcolonies that exceed the threshold decreases . That is , although an increase in petite frequency is expected to increase the amount of contamination , this increase is mitigated by a resulting increase in the MitoTracker threshold . To simulate a \u201cworst-case\u201d scenario of high petite frequency in a particular experiment , we sampled FY4 rho0 microcolonies to add to the wild-type FY4 data set at a final proportion of 38% . We chose 38% because it is approximately the petite frequency mean plus twice the standard deviation , as estimated by the proportion of microcolonies below the MitoTracker threshold in six biological replicate experiments on the wild-type FY4 genotype . This value of 38% also exceeds the maximum petite frequency we observed for this genotype by direct scoring of petite colonies in 20 independent experiments ( range for these 20 experiments: 1 . 59%\u2013 27 . 9% ) . The resulting contamination estimate , based on 100 such random samplings , has mean 2 . 34% and standard deviation 0 . 56% . We can compare this expected amount of contamination with the proportion of slower-growing , high-Tsl1 microcolonies , as estimated from the data presented in Fig 4B and S2B Fig . Examination of Fig 4B and S2B Fig suggests there are two clusters of microcolonies in the wild-type genetic background: one containing faster-growing , low-Tsl1 microcolonies and one containing slower-growing , high-Tsl1 microcolonies . We used partitioning around medoids to separate the data into two clusters and indeed the two expected clusters emerge ( with one medoid at growth rate 0 . 436 h\u20131 and Tsl1-GFP fluorescence intensity 0 . 0249 and the other medoid at growth rate 0 . 317 h\u20131 and Tsl1-GFP fluorescence intensity 0 . 0366 ) ( S3A Fig ) . The slower-growing , higher-Tsl1 cluster contains 20 . 4% of the microcolonies , so contamination by fewer than 4% petites would not substantially change the appearance of the plot . Moreover , we can flip the analysis around and select the microcolonies from this strain that passed the MitoTracker threshold but are most likely to be petites ( by selecting those microcolonies in the lowest 3% of MitoTracker staining ) and ask where these points fall on the plot . As expected , these microcolonies are biased toward being slower growing , but they are not biased toward higher Tsl1-GFP fluorescence ( S3B Fig ) . Even for the microcolonies that did not pass the MitoTracker threshold and are therefore the most likely to be petites , there is no evidence of bias toward higher Tsl1-GFP fluorescence despite an increased bias toward being slower growing ( S3B Fig ) . Therefore , an erroneous inclusion of petites in the wild-type Tsl1-GFP data could not explain the dramatic change in the relationship between Tsl1-GFP and growth rate upon addition of 8-bromo-cAMP or pde2 mutation . If intracellular cAMP levels control heterogeneity in growth and stress-response gene expression , then not only should manipulations of cAMP levels have predicted effects , but also cAMP levels should differ between unmanipulated cells . In particular , slower-growing cells should have lower cAMP levels . To test this prediction , we used FACS on the FY4-derived TSL1-GFP strain to obtain subpopulations of cells expressing high ( top 10% ) or low ( bottom 50% ) levels of Tsl1 , and then measured cAMP concentration in cell extracts ( see Methods ) . These measurements support the prediction . The cAMP concentration of the high-Tsl1 fraction is approximately 27% lower than that of the low-Tsl1 fraction , with the difference estimated as 0 . 832\u00b10 . 217 pmol/107 cells ( P = 0 . 0007 by likelihood ratio test of nested mixed-effect linear models that take into account technical and biological replicates and do or do not include a fixed effect for fraction membership ) . Because the experiments to measure cAMP were performed without MitoTracker-based exclusion of petites , we additionally confirmed that the results were not somehow biased by petite cells . We measured petite frequencies by plating on standard YPD agar plates approximately 1000 cells from each member of five replicate pairs of high-Tsl1 and low-Tsl1 FACS samples , and staining with 2 , 3 , 5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride ( TTC ) to reveal colonies with functional mitochondria , which appear red rather than white ( see Methods ) . There is no significant difference in petite frequency between the high-Tsl1 and low-Tsl1 fractions ( 15 . 3% vs . 14 . 4% , respectively; paired t-test on arcsine-transformed frequencies P = 0 . 685 ) . The difference in intracellular cAMP concentration between the Tsl1-sorted subpopulations enriched for slower- or faster- growing cells suggests that heterogeneity in cAMP levels exists and might correlate with growth at the single-cell level . It would be ideal to quantify intracellular cAMP at the single-cell level in the context of the microcolony growth assay . A fluorescence resonance energy transfer ( FRET ) cAMP sensor successfully reports the cAMP increase in starved cells upon glucose addition [92] . We tested this FRET sensor in our strain background , and unfortunately it did not have sufficient signal-to-noise ratio to measure cAMP heterogeneity in cells under benign conditions , which is not entirely surprising given that this heterogeneity is likely of considerably lower magnitude than the concentration change after adding glucose to starved cells . Moreover , even if a less-noisy sensor could be found , we would worry that a kind of observer effect would pertain: by measuring cAMP the sensor would take cAMP out of the natural system and thereby perturb the system\u2019s function . Our solution is instead to use what has been demonstrated to be an endogenous reporter of cAMP concentration , by virtue of the effect of cAMP on PKA activity: nuclear localization of Msn2 [38] . Higher levels of cAMP are associated with higher PKA activity and therefore lower nuclear occupancy of Msn2 , whereas lower levels of cAMP are associated with lower PKA activity and therefore higher nuclear occupancy of Msn2 . To test for an association between Msn2 nuclear occupancy and growth , we conducted experiments in which we monitored Msn2 localization at 1-min intervals in individual cells for 30 min , then tracked growth of the microcolonies produced by those cells as usual ( see Methods ) . For these experiments , we constructed a strain in the FY4 genetic background expressing a fusion of Msn2 with the red-fluorescent protein mRuby2 ( MSN2-mRuby2 ) , as well as a fusion of the core histone Htb2 with GFP ( HTB2-GFP , to mark nuclei ) and a fusion of Tsl1 with the teal-fluorescent protein mTFP1 ( TSL1-mTFP1 , to sort cells by FACS ) . FACS sorting by Tsl1 expression was used because the imaging at 1-min intervals considerably reduces the throughput of the experiment , so it was necessary to enrich for slower-growing cells to get a sufficient representation of them . At each of the 30 time points for imaging Msn2 localization , we segmented each cell into nucleus and cytoplasm using the Htb2-GFP signal , then computed relative Msn2 nuclear abundance as the ratio between the median nuclear intensity of mRuby2 and the median cytoplasmic intensity of mRuby2 ( Fig 5A , see Methods ) . From these relative abundances , we then computed for each cell a measure we call total nuclear occupancy . This measure is calculated by first identifying a baseline relative nuclear abundance as the mean of the four lowest relative abundances , then summing the differences between this baseline and the relative abundance at each other time point , then dividing by the number of such time points ( because not all cells are faithfully tracked for all 30 time points ) . Setting the baseline in this way , for each cell , is important because of technical variation in fluorescence intensity within and between images . Changing the baseline-setting procedure to include the one , two , three or five lowest relative abundances , rather than the four lowest , has an extremely minor effect on the computed total nuclear occupancies and does not change any of the conclusions reported here . The total nuclear occupancy measure is somewhat noisy , as it is based on a small number of time points ( capturing a few nuclear entry events per cell at most ) and because of the limitation of imaging cells in the context of the microcolony assay ( i . e . , not in a plane constrained by a microfluidic chamber or a slide and coverslip ) . Nonetheless , as predicted , a cell\u2019s total nuclear occupancy of Msn2 negatively correlates with subsequent growth of the microcolony founded by that cell ( Fig 5B ) . This result suggests that cell-to-cell differences in cAMP concentration do indeed underlie differences in growth . Of course , an unknown factor other than cAMP concentration might be determining Msn2 localization under these conditions , but given the cAMP concentration difference we saw in the bulk subpopulations of slower- and faster-growing cells and given the well-studied effect of cAMP concentration on PKA activity and Msn2 localization , we consider cAMP the most likely candidate at this point . And at the very least , our results demonstrate that Msn2 subcellular localization dynamics matter not only during responses to stress [46] , but also under benign conditions . Having shown that cAMP levels are relevant to nongenetic heterogeneity in growth and Tsl1 expression , and that heterogeneity of Msn2 activity ( likely caused by heterogeneity of cAMP levels acting through PKA ) correlates with growth , we next sought to test a causative relationship between Msn2 ( and Msn4 ) and nongenetic heterogeneity . We therefore tested whether removing Msn2 or Msn4 reduces the abundances of slower-growing cells and high-Tsl1 cells . We compared the growth-rate distribution of the FY4 wild type with those of FY4-derived msn2-deletion mutants , msn4-deletion mutants , and the msn2 msn4 double deletion . Relative to the growth-rate distribution of FY4 , the growth-rate distribution of msn2-mutant cells has significantly fewer slower-growing cells ( medcouple Z-test P = 5 . 32 X 10\u22125 ) , as do the growth-rate distribution of msn4-mutant cells ( medcouple Z-test P = 5 . 19 X 10\u22127 ) and the growth-rate distribution of msn2 msn4 double-mutant cells ( medcouple Z-test P = 1 . 84 X 10\u22126 ) ( Fig 6A ) . There is no significant difference in skew between any pair of these mutant genotypes ( medcouple Z-test , msn2 vs . msn4: P = 0 . 105; msn2 vs . msn2 msn4: P = 0 . 163; msn4 vs . msn2 msn4 P = 0 . 397 ) . These results imply that Msn2 and Msn4 are each necessary for nongenetic heterogeneity by virtue of increasing the proportion of slower-growing cells . Msn2 , but not Msn4 , is also required for heterogeneous expression of Tsl1 under benign conditions . The msn2-deletion mutant and the msn2 msn4 double-deletion mutant qualitatively gave the same result as did the pde2-deletion mutant and the FY4 cells cultured with 8-bromo-cAMP: across growth rates Tsl1-GFP fluorescence was at close to baseline levels ( Fig 6B , S4 Fig ) . By contrast , the msn4-deletion mutant qualitatively gave the same result as did the FY4 wild type: a negative correlation between microcolony growth rate and Tsl1-GFP fluorescence intensity ( Fig 6B , S4 Fig ) . These results establish Msn2 as a key regulator of heterogeneous gene expression under benign conditions , and provide additional evidence that slow growth and the stress response are not inextricably linked , in that msn4 mutants maintain heterogeneous Tsl1 expression but show reduced abundance of slower-growing cells . The effects on the growth-rate distribution of manipulations of cAMP levels and of msn2 and msn4 mutations are consistent with each other and predict that raising PKA activity would cause there to be fewer slower-growing cells whereas lowering PKA activity would skew the growth-rate distribution toward slow growth . One way to test this prediction is to study mutations in the genes encoding PKA subunits . However , the effects of mutations in PKA components are highly pleiotropic and are typically difficult to interpret , because: 1 ) PKA signaling influences many cellular processes , including carbon usage , stress resistance and ribosome biogenesis; 2 ) PKA activity is embedded in nutrient- and stress-sensing networks with complex cross-talk and feedbacks; and 3 ) the three Tpk catalytic subunits are not completely redundant [36 , 38 , 41 , 93\u201396] . Indeed , we find that PKA mutations have effects opposite to the simple prediction . The growth-rate distributions of tpk1 or tpk2 deletion mutants have reduced left tails relative to FY4 , whereas the growth-rate distribution of a bcy1 deletion mutant is heavily skewed toward slow growth ( S5 Fig ) . Because this contrary result might be caused by complex feedbacks , we sought to test the role of PKA activity in nongenetic heterogeneity by assaying cells upon mild perturbation of this activity . Specifically , we treated cells with H89 , which inhibits PKA activity in a concentration-dependent manner in yeast [97] . We cultured cells for these experiments without H89 and only exposed cells to H89 at the beginning of growth-rate monitoring , so as to assay the short-term effect of PKA impairment rather than a physiologically adapted cell state . Because H89 needs to be dissolved in DMSO , we used a separate control for each H89 concentration , which contained the same amount of DMSO but no H89 . Consistent with our original prediction , populations of FY4 cells treated with a range of H89 concentrations all show mean growth rates shifted towards slow growth relative to corresponding DMSO controls ( at 10 \u03bcM H89: 0 . 425 h\u20131 , DMSO control: 0 . 427 h\u20131 , Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test , P = 1 . 5 X 10\u22127; at 40 \u03bcM H89: 0 . 413 h\u20131 , DMSO control: 0 . 420 h\u20131 , Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test , P < 2 . 2 X 10\u221216; at 50 \u03bcM H89: 0 . 410 h\u20131 , DMSO control: 0 . 417 h\u20131 , Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test , P < 2 . 2 X 10\u221216; at 75 \u03bcM H89: 0 . 405 h\u20131 , DMSO control: 0 . 415 h\u20131 , Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test , P < 2 . 2 X 10\u221216 ) ( Fig 7 ) . The importance of the matched DMSO controls is evident , in that DMSO , even at the lowest concentration ( 0 . 1% , corresponding to 10 \u03bcM H89 ) has an effect on growth rate mean ( no DMSO: 0 . 432 h\u20131 , Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test , P < 2 . 2 X 10\u221216 for each comparison with a DMSO control ) . To confirm that H89 affects the most relevant PKA target , Msn2 , we assayed H89-treated and DMSO control cells for their relative Msn2 nuclear abundance , calculated as above as the ratio of median nuclear to median cytoplasmic Msn2-mRuby2 fluorescence intensity . DMSO alone induces significantly greater relative nuclear abundance of Msn2 , consistent with DMSO inducing a stress response and reducing growth . At 0 . 75% DMSO ( control for 75 \u03bcM H89 ) , the mean relative Msn2 nuclear abundance is 1 . 073 , relative to 1 . 051 for no DMSO ( Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test , P < 2 . 2 X 10\u221216 ) . Nonetheless , consistent with prediction , H89 yields a significant additional increase in mean relative Msn2 nuclear abundance ( 1 . 077 , Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test , P = 5 . 9 X 10\u22125 for comparison with DMSO control ) ( S6 Fig ) . To be true , our hypothesis that variability in the Ras/cAMP/PKA pathway underlies a bet-hedging strategy in budding yeast requires that manipulations of cAMP levels or of PKA or its downstream transcription factors not only alter growth and gene expression , but also alter acute stress tolerance in a consistent way . In particular , we expected increased cAMP levels or msn2 deletion to reduce acute stress tolerance . Because msn4 is not required for heterogeneous Tsl1 expression , msn4 deletion might not have an effect on acute stress tolerance , or it might if stress-protective targets besides TSL1 require Msn4 . We further expected PKA impairment to increase acute stress tolerance . To test acute stress tolerance , we first subjected populations of FY4 , FY4 cultured with 8-bromo-cAMP , and pde2 , ira2 , msn2 , msn4 , and msn2 msn4 mutants to an intense heat shock ( 51\u00b0 C for 2 min ) that produces high mortality ( >75% ) in the FY4 wild type ( Fig 8A ) . The pde2 and ira2 mutants both show a significant reduction in survival rate of approximately 100-fold relative to FY4 ( one-way ANOVA on arcsine-transformed survival rates followed by Tukey\u2019s HSD test , adjusted P = 3 . 0 X 10\u22129 for FY4 vs . pde2 and adjusted P = 2 . 5 X 10\u22129 for FY4 vs . ira2 ) . Increasing intracellular cAMP levels through addition of 8-bromo-cAMP also significantly reduces survival , to a level that is 1000-fold lower than that of FY4 ( adjusted P = 1 . 0 X 10\u22129 ) . MSN2 and MSN4 appear to be partially redundant with respect to tolerance of acute heat stress , with MSN2 being more important . The msn2 mutant shows a significant reduction in survival rate of a little more than two-fold relative to FY4 ( adjusted P = 1 . 8 X 10\u22124 ) , whereas the msn4 mutant shows a slight and nonsignificant reduction relative to FY4 ( adjusted P = 1 . 0 ) . Consistent with partial redundancy , the msn2 msn4 double mutant shows a greater reduction in survival rate than msn2 alone , of approximately 10-fold relative to FY4 ( adjusted P = 5 . 3 X 10\u22128 for comparison with FY4 , adjusted P = 2 . 3 X 10\u22124 for comparison with msn2 ) . The results for msn2 and msn4 suggest that , of the genes that contribute to acute heat-stress tolerance , few if any require Msn4 , some require Msn2 ( such as TSL1 ) , and others require neither specifically but at least one of the two . The pde2 and ira2 survival rates are not significantly different from that of the msn2 msn4 double mutant ( adjusted P = 0 . 082 and 0 . 059 , respectively ) , but the 8-bromo-cAMP survival rate is ( adjusted P = 6 . 8 X 10\u22123 ) , which suggests that cAMP might not reduce acute-stress tolerance solely through Msn2 and Msn4 . To test the effect of PKA impairment , acute heat shocks were performed on H89-treated cells . These experiments were done separately from the heat-shock experiments above because of the need for DMSO controls for each concentration of H89 . Consistent with the results that H89-treated cells have reduced mean growth rates and increased mean Msn2 nuclear occupancy , cell populations treated with 50 \u03bcM or 75 \u03bcM H89 both have significantly increased survival rates compared with their respective DMSO controls ( 50 \u03bcM H89: adjusted P = 1 . 0 X 10\u22123; 75 \u03bcM H89: adjusted P = 1 . 4 X 10\u22123 ) ( Fig 8B ) . It is important to note that , although DMSO decreases mean growth rate and increases mean Msn2 nuclear occupancy , DMSO decreases survival rates relative to no DMSO ( Fig 8B ) . The decreased survival rate is not statistically significant for 0 . 5% DMSO ( adjusted P = 0 . 12 ) but is significant for 0 . 75% DMSO ( adjusted P = 4 . 4 X 10\u22124 ) . These decreases suggest that reducing mean growth rate and increasing mean Msn2 nuclear occupancy are not sufficient to confer greater stress tolerance , but instead suggest that DMSO is acting as a stress to which cells respond but succumb . The observation that H89 reverses the decreases in survival rate suggests that H89 is not merely further taxing the cells but is instead increasing their preparedness for acute stress . To test how the relationship between growth and acute stress tolerance at the single-cell level is altered by loss of Msn2 , we performed microcolony growth assays in which an acute heat stress ( 5 min at 70\u00b0 C with final plate temperature measured to be 51\u00b0 C ) was delivered 5 h into the experiment and then heat-shocked microcolonies were monitored for an additional 15 h to assay survival ( see Methods ) . We had previously used a similar experiment to show that Tsl1 expression correlates both with growth and with acute-stress tolerance at the single-cell level , as it does at the population level [3] . In the current experiments , we also included the TSL1-GFP reporter , both to confirm the prior results and to investigate whether the attenuated Tsl1 expression differences that remain after msn2 deletion still correlate with stress tolerance . In addition to comparing wild-type TSL1-GFP to msn2-mutant TSL1-GFP , we also compared these genotypes to msn4-mutant TSL1-GFP , because msn4-mutant cells have an altered growth-rate distribution but still show a correlation between Tsl1 expression and growth . The wild-type TSL1-GFP strain does indeed recapitulate prior results , in that individual microcolonies are more likely to survive the slower they are growing before heat shock ( Fig 9A and 9B ) and the more they are expressing Tsl1 before heat shock ( Fig 9C ) . Deletion of msn4 has negligible effect on survival rate , consistent with the results above from the heat shocks in bulk populations ( Fig 9A and 9B ) . In contrast , deletion of msn2 reduces the survival rate , and this reduction is most pronounced at slow growth rates ( Fig 9A and 9B ) . In other words , those slower-growing cells that exist despite msn2 deletion have reduced stress tolerance compared with equally slow-growing cells that exist in the wild type . That said , the relationship between slow growth and survival is not completely eliminated by msn2 deletion ( Fig 9B ) , suggesting that there is a residual , Msn2-independent mechanism that ties slow growth to stress tolerance . As shown in Fig 9C , msn2 deletion eliminates the correlation between Tsl1-GFP expression level and survival ( whereas , as expected , msn4 deletion does not ) . One possible explanation for this result relates to the finding of altered covariances of Msn2 targets upon gene-dosage perturbations of Ras/cAMP/PKA pathway members [53] . Specifically , it could be that the cell-to-cell differences in Tsl1 expression that remain after msn2 deletion are not correlated with cell-to-cell differences in other Msn2-dependent stress-tolerance factors , as they would be in wild-type cells , so the total amount of stress protection averages out . \n The results of this study are consistent with a model ( Fig 10 ) in which cAMP levels differ in isogenic cells cultured in the same , benign environment , leading to cellular heterogeneity in the activities of the transcription factors Msn2 and Msn4 ( in particular their nuclear occupancy ) and thereby to cellular heterogeneity in growth rate and stress tolerance . Mutations that increase intracellular cAMP levels ( ira2 and pde2 deletions ) or remove the transcription factors ( msn2 and msn4 deletions ) reduce growth heterogeneity by reducing the abundance of slower-growing cells , as does culturing of wild-type cells with the cell-permeable cAMP analog 8-bromo-cAMP . These manipulations also reduce tolerance of cells to acute heat stress , although the effect of msn4 deletion is only seen in combination with msn2 deletion , suggesting that heterogeneous expression of stress-tolerance genes primarily requires Msn2 ( but in some cases loss of Msn2 can be compensated by functional Msn4 ) . TSL1 appears to be one such gene that requires Msn2 but not Msn4 . Whereas msn4 deletion has no detectable effect on Tsl1 expression heterogeneity , pde2 or msn2 deletion reduces Tsl1 expression heterogeneity by eliminating high-expressing cells , as does culturing of wild-type cells with 8-bromo-cAMP . Taken together , our results show that Msn2 has a major , but not exclusive , role in linking slower growth to higher tolerance of acute heat stress , and that heterogeneity in Msn2 activity is most likely caused by cell-to-cell differences in cAMP levels . One important feature of this model is that slow growth and stress tolerance are not inevitably linked . A connection between slow growth and stress tolerance has been observed in several systems [4 , 14 , 31 , 32] , but our results argue that this connection is to some extent an evolved one rather than an automatic one . In particular , we have added to our previous finding that tsl1 deletion does not appreciably alter the distribution of microcolony growth rates [3] the findings that: 1 ) Msn4 is not required for heterogeneous Tsl1 expression but is required for normal abundance of slower-growing cells , and 2 ) there are both Msn2-dependent and Msn2-independent slower-growing cells that have different tolerances of acute heat stress . Two features of this model are difficult to reconcile with our experimental data , but we believe these discrepancies do not negate the general conclusion that the Ras/cAMP/PKA pathway , acting through Msn2 and Msn4 , underlies nongenetic heterogeneity in yeast-cell growth and stress tolerance . First , the pde2 deletion not only reduces the abundance of slower-growing cells in the left tail of the microcolony growth-rate distribution but also increases the abundance of cells with intermediate growth rates ( the shoulder of the growth-rate distribution ) . We suspect that the exact nature of the pde2 deletion matters , perhaps due to effects on neighboring genes , because of our unexpected finding that , contrary to a prior report using a different deletion , pde2-deleted cells can survive as petites . Further work will be necessary to untangle the effect of Pde2 on growth heterogeneity . In the meantime , we note that the clear effects of pde2 deletion on Tsl1 expression heterogeneity and on acute heat-stress tolerance are as predicted by the model . Second , mutations in PKA components have effects that are opposite to expectations . The model predicts that removing PKA activity ( by tpk1 or tpk2 deletion ) would shift the growth-rate distribution toward slower-growing cells and that enhancing PKA activity ( by bcy1 deletion ) would reduce the abundance of slower-growing cells . We can only state that this is not the first time that unexpected results have been seen with mutations in PKA components [41] and that further work will be necessary to determine how our results might be explained by PKA\u2019s pleiotropic activities , including activities that do not go through Msn2 and Msn4 , by the unclear functional overlaps between its alternate catalytic subunits , or by complex feedbacks and cross-talk with other signaling pathways . In the meantime , we have demonstrated that the immediate consequences of mild impairment of PKA activity by H89 are as predicted by our model: mean growth rate decreases , mean Msn2 nuclear occupancy increases , and acute stress tolerance increases . The major unknown in our model is the ultimate source of differences in cAMP levels between cells . Because culturing of wild-type cells in 8-bromo-cAMP reduces heterogeneity , we infer that the source of heterogeneity is upstream of cAMP . However , this inference leaves many possibilities . As a second messenger molecule , cAMP integrates various environmental signals , including those received through sensors of glucose and nitrogen concentrations as well as sensors of oxidative stress , heat stress and DNA damage [98\u2013108] . The DNA-damage response is the only potential source of heterogeneity that we have ruled out as being a major contributor to growth heterogeneity ( although , to be clear , we have not ruled out that the small minority of the population that have been characterized as DNA damage-induced persisters [74] contributes to evolutionary adaptation ) . Even though we culture cells in rich medium without nominal stress , nutrients and stressors might still show microenvironmental fluctuations that could trigger cAMP changes , or the nutrient or stress sensors might have variable abundances or activities among cells . Moreover , intracellular cAMP levels are regulated by feedback loops emanating from PKA itself [109] , so as is the case with all feedback-including networks , definitions of upstream and downstream break down . Any candidate source of heterogeneity must be inherited across cell generations , because a daughter cell tends to inherit the approximate growth rate of its mother , with occasional switches from slower growth to faster growth or vice versa [3] . Chromatin-based mechanisms , which can have switching rates on the order of tens of generations [110] , might be good candidates , although such mechanisms would need to generate a continuous distribution of growth states rather than a simple bimodal distribution . One theoretical mechanism that has been proposed for long-lasting persistence of any particular state along a continuum is kinetic memory , which can be achieved when a system of enzyme-catalyzed reactions includes an enzyme that is present at a concentration lower than that of its substrates [111] . We propose that one specific candidate for the source of inherited heterogeneity is cytosolic pH , which affects Ras signaling . Around neutral cytosolic pH , there is a positive relationship between cytosolic pH and growth , as the vacuolar H+-ATPase ( V-ATPase ) promotes growth by activating Ras , which increases intracellular cAMP concentration [112] . The major regulator of cytosolic pH is Pma1 , a long-lived protein that is asymmetrically localized to the plasma membrane of mother cells . A newborn cell begins with a very low level of Pma1 , derived from new synthesis; as generations progress , the Pma1 level increases in this cell [113] . Low Pma1 means low cytosolic pH , so a newborn cell has lower cytosolic pH than its mother [113] . If Pma1 expression is heterogeneous , then a subset of newborn cells might have especially low cytosolic pH that takes many generations to catch up ( which could give rise to slower-growing microcolonies ) . Alternatively or additionally , if Pma1 asymmetric inheritance is heterogeneous , then a subset of newborn cells might have especially high cytosolic pH ( which could give rise to faster-growing microcolonies ) . Pma1 undergoes post-transcriptional modification along cell division [114] , so Pma1 in aged cells could have altered function , which might explain the observation that slower-growing cells tend to be replicatively older than faster-growing cells [3] , despite having higher cytosolic pH [113] . Indeed , it has been suggested that a mechanism other than Ras activation through the V-ATPase could be involved in regulating cell growth at alkaline cytosolic pH [112] . The Ras/cAMP/PKA pathway is highly conserved across eukaryotes [82 , 115 , 116] so our findings might have relevance to human disease . As it does in yeast , cAMP acts as a second messenger in human cells and regulates a wide range of functions . In humans , these functions include ion-channel conductivity , synaptic release of neurotransmitters , cytoskeletal remodeling , metabolism , proliferation , differentiation and apoptosis [117 , 118] . Dysregulation of cAMP levels is associated with the onset or progression of various cancers [119\u2013124] . For example , activating the cAMP/PKA pathway is one way to tolerate glucose depletion and acquire aggressive growth in cancer cells [125] . Likewise , in a subset of melanomas , increased cAMP levels confer resistance to MAP kinase pathway inhibitors in a PKA-dependent manner , presumably by promoting growth through an alternate route [13] . However , because different cell types may regulate cAMP levels differently and show differential expression and localization of PKA subunits , cAMP can work as a growth activator or inhibitor in different cell lines [119 , 122 , 124 , 126 , 127] . As a result , for some cancers but not others , cAMP or PKA can be a very good target of therapy , and some cAMP analogs and PKA antisense oligonucleotides have been tested as anticancer agents [128\u2013131] . Either way , to the extent that cell-to-cell differences in Ras/cAMP/PKA pathway activity exist , they could contribute to nongenetic heterogeneity in tolerance of chemotherapy within a tumor . Appropriate manipulations of cAMP levels or PKA activity might therefore reduce heterogeneity and thereby render a tumor-cell population more uniformly susceptible to a second drug . This strategy , of manipulating cAMP levels to reduce nongenetic heterogeneity so that a second drug has higher efficacy , might also be valuable for treating fungal infections . For example , if pathogenic S . cerevisiae show the same form of nongenetic heterogeneity that the strain background we used does , then increasing cAMP levels might render an infection more susceptible to fever or another drug . Of course , care must be taken for two important reasons . First , the principle behind the strategy is that an infectious population will be made to grow faster on average than it otherwise would , because slower-growing , stress-tolerant cells are reduced . If an appropriate , effective stress is not applied concurrently , then the infection could be made worse . Second , any therapy administered to treat a fungal infection may also impact otherwise-healthy host cells . Increasing cAMP levels in infecting yeast might render the patient more susceptible to particular cancers , or less treatable should they arise . Perhaps one cautious way forward would be to examine microbiome composition of patients already being treated with cAMP-increasing drugs , such as cAMP analogs or forskolin , which activates adenylyl cyclase . \n All strains used in this study are prototrophic MATa haploids derived from the wild-type FY4 background , except the HSP12-mCherry; RNR3-GFP strain ( BY4741 , MATa , his3 leu2 met15 ura3 , RNR3-EGFP-HIS; HSP12-mCherry-KanMX ) , which was acquired from Gilad Yaakov and Naama Barkai [74] . Unless otherwise specified , all mutants were made so as to cleanly delete genes without leaving marker or vector sequences behind . We used the KanMX; pGAL-p53 ( Kp53 ) delitto perfetto cassette [132] , as follows . The entire coding sequence of a target gene was replaced with Kp53 by homologous recombination and selected for resistance against G418 , using standard protocols . Next , a construct concatenating the flanking sequences of the target gene was used to excise the entire Kp53 cassette by homologous recombination and selection on galactose plates . Cells that retained the cassette would have p53 expression , which is toxic and represses cell growth . The bcy1 deletion used in this study retained the Kp53 cassette because selection against p53 was not possible as the bcy1 mutant cannot utilize galactose . A TSL1-GFP strain and an MSN2-mRuby2 , HTB2-GFP , TSL1-mTFP1 strain were also constructed using the delitto perfetto cassette , so that there is no marker gene accompanying insertion of fluorescent-protein coding sequence . First , the Kp53 cassette was inserted by homologous recombination at the 3\u2019 end of the coding sequence of the target gene , replacing its stop codon . Then , coding sequence of the fluorescent fusion protein , including sequence immediately 3\u2019 of the stop codon of the target gene , was transformed and selected on galactose to remove the Kp53 cassette and introduce the fusion to fluorescent-protein coding sequence . The transformation construct for this step was either PCR-amplified from the GFP-fusion sequence that existed ( alongside an auxotrophic marker ) in the yeast GFP collection used previously [3] or made by overlapping PCR to paste together coding sequences of the 3\u2019 end of the target gene , a linker , and the fluorescent protein . The double-mutant msn2 msn4 strain was made by crossing the msn2 and msn4 single mutants . TSL1-GFP msn2 , TSL1-GFP msn4 , TSL1-GFP msn2 msn4 , and TSL1-GFP pde2 strains were made by crossing the respective single-mutant or double-mutant strains with the TSL1-GFP strain . The MSN2-mRuby2 , HTB2-GFP , TSL1-mTFP1 strain was made by crossing the MSN2-mRuby2 , HTB2-GFP and HTB2-GFP , TSL1-mTFP1 strains . In these crosses , tetrads derived from the F1 diploids were tested for genotype and mating type with colony PCR and halo assays , respectively , using standard methods . For all generated strains , several ( typically three ) independent biological clones were isolated . Preliminary validation experiments , with replicates performed on different dates , were done to ensure clones did not differ in their microcolony growth-rate distributions and fluorescent-reporter expression , then a single clone per genotype was chosen for subsequent experiments to maximize throughput . For all strains , -80\u00b0 C frozen stocks were made from saturated YPD liquid cultures . Two days prior to any microscopy experiment , strains from the frozen stocks were inoculated into Synthetic Complete ( SC ) liquid medium and grown to saturation overnight . For the ira2 mutant , a larger inoculum was used to compensate for its slower average growth rate . Because the bcy1 deletion mutant cannot utilize ethanol as a carbon source , saturation was intentionally avoided by using a small inoculum . One day before a microscopy experiment , saturated cell cultures were diluted into fresh SC liquid media by a factor of 2X105 , to about 1X103 cells/ml , except in the cases of ira2 and bcy1 mutants , for which the diluted concentration was about 2X104 cells/ml . For addition of the cAMP analog , fresh SC liquid medium was supplemented with 15 mM 8-bromo-cAMP ( Sigma , Catalog Number: B7880 , dissolved in water ) and culture tubes were wrapped with foil to protect the light-sensitive compound . ira2 and bcy1 mutants were diluted to about 2X104 cells/ml into fresh SC liquid media . After dilution , all strains were cultivated for 18 h in log phase before the experiment to ensure that all cells had exited lag phase and to ensure that the cAMP analog had an opportunity to have an effect . For treatment with H89 ( Sigma , Catalog Number: B1427 , dissolved in DMSO ) , cells were cultivated for 18 h in log phase in the absence of H89 , then transferred to medium with H89 at the onset of growth-rate monitoring , so as to test the immediate effect of PKA perturbation rather than the effect of physiological adaptation to low PKA activity . For all strains , cell densities before microscopy were approximately 106 cells/ml . Cells were stained with MitoTracker Red CMXRos ( ThermoFisher , Catalog Number: M7512 ) for petite exclusion . Staining was performed immediately before microscope plating , at approximate cell densities of 106 cells/ml . For each strain , 200 \u03bcL of cell culture was aspirated into a 1 . 5-ml opaque black tube , which protects the staining reaction from light . After a brief centrifugation at 2320 x g for 1 min , 100 \u03bcL of supernatant was removed , leaving 100 \u03bcL behind . In this way , cells remained immersed in the same culture media during staining . We found this step to be crucial for successful staining . MitoTracker stains cells based on mitochondrial inner membrane potential , which is directly related to respiration activity . The 106 cells/ml stage is good for such staining , as it ensures that cells are still in log phase , but also ensures that normal cells should already have weak respiration while petites should have none . Using water instead of the resident media would cause a change in glucose concentration , and hence respiration activity , depending on the genotype . Using fresh SC instead of the resident media would cause an increase in glucose that could suppress any respiration , making normal cells look like petites . Using a consistent cell density ( 106 cells/ml ) kept glucose levels consistent across genotypes . To prepare the MitoTracker dye for each experiment , 50 \u03bcg was dissolved in 50 \u03bcL of DMSO and then diluted with 1 ml of sterile water . Then 10 \u03bcL of this solution was added into each tube and mixed well with cells and remaining media . The dye/cell mixture was then kept at room temperature for 10 min . To terminate staining , the dye was diluted by addition of 1 ml of fresh SC , cells were immediately centrifuged at 2320 x g for 1 min , and supernatant was removed as quickly and as completely as possible . Then cells were resuspended in 1 ml fresh SC . Adding fresh SC at this point does not cause problems because export of the dye , once imported , is slow . For cells growing on YPD agar plates , petite staining was performed with 2 , 3 , 5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride ( TTC ) staining . Colonies were grown on YPD agar plates for at least two days before overlaying with TTC [133] . TTC , originally white , is reduced to a red form in normal cells by various dehydrogenases within functional mitochondria , whereas in petites it remains white . TTC-overlaid plates were incubated at 30\u00b0 C in the dark for 30 min while the agar solidified and the TTC stain developed . Then colonies on each plate were manually counted based on color . The microcolony growth assay was performed as in previous work [3] with some modifications . In brief , 96-well glass bottom plates were coated with concanavalin A ( Type IV , Sigma , Catalog Number C2010-1G ) then washed with water and filled with 390 \u03bcL of fresh filtered SC per well . Prepared cells were counted with a hemocytometer and diluted to approximately 4X105 cells/ml . Unlike in the original protocol [3] , cells were not sonicated prior to plating , as this step was unnecessary to separate cells and could introduce a stress . Into each well , 10 \u03bcL of cell culture was seeded , making the final density approximately 4000 cells per well . For cells treated with 8-bromo-cAMP , the compound was added to a final concentration of 15 mM in a dark room after seeding the plate , to minimize exposure to light . For cells treated with H89 or DMSO , appropriate volumes were added to the SC medium in each well before seeding cells . Plates were sealed with a breathable plate membrane film ( Sigma , Catalog Number Z380059-1PAK ) that permits air exchange and prevents condensation , and were then spun at 453 x g for 2 min to help cells settle onto the glass surface . For time-lapse analysis of microcolony growth , all images were captured on a Nikon Eclipse Ti inverted microscope with Nikon plan Apo 10X air objective and 1 . 5X magnification , once per hour for 10 h . For experiments in which Tsl1-GFP signal was monitored , a well mask was used to space out image fields in each well to avoid optical stress imposed by repeated short-wavelength light exposure when imaging neighboring fields . Similarly , a well mask was used for experiments with cells cultured with 8-bromo-cAMP , to reduce loss of active 8-bromo-cAMP by repeated light exposure . The growth rates of microcolonies were measured by tracking their areas at each time point [3 , 6] . We developed and used a new algorithm , PIE , for detecting microcolony edges using changes in direction of the pixel-intensity gradient [134] . PIE improves robustness against variations in focal plane and brightness and thereby achieves lower standard errors of growth-rate estimates [134] . As in prior work , growth-rate data were analyzed with linear mixed-effect modeling to partition random effects from imaging field , well , and , when relevant , replicate plate and the interaction between strain and plate [6] . Four replicate experiments from different dates were used to assay Msn2 subcellular localization dynamics ( Fig 5B ) , as the necessary 1-min imaging interval heavily limits sample size . Two replicate experiments from different dates were used to assay microcolony growth rates across the range of H89 concentrations ( Fig 7 ) because preliminary experiments indicated that mean differences between adjacent concentrations were small . Two replicate experiments from different FACS run dates were used to assay microcolony growth rates of founder cells from different bins of Rnr3-GFP fluorescence intensity ( S1D Fig ) because preliminary experiments indicated that mean differences between adjacent bins were small . For microcolony-growth experiments recording fluorescence from MitoTracker staining and/or Tsl1-GFP , fluorescent images were only acquired at the first time point , to reduce phototoxicity . Fluorescence intensity of each cell was calculated as the median intensity of the cell body minus the median intensity of the immediate background within the smallest rectangle bounding the cell . Because cells with extremely low or no signal could then have negative intensities , each value was then further corrected by subtracting the minimal value of the entire experiment . Estimates of petite frequency for validating the MitoTracker staining approach came from the six microcolony-growth experiments conducted on the FY4 genotype . Partitioning around medoids was conducted in R with the cluster package , using Euclidean distance and standardized growth-rate and fluorescence values to weight these two dimensions equally . For FACS , strains were prepared in the same way as for microscopy experiments , with one exception: during the inoculation one day before FACS , an additional culture tube for TSL1-GFP was prepared with half the regular inoculation concentration . The purpose of this extra tube was to enable an extended FACS session . The more dilute culture replaced the regular one after two hours of sorting , which keeps the cell density around the same over this extended period . All samples were first gated by the ratio of Forward Scattered Area ( FSC-A ) to Forward Scattered Width ( FSC-W ) to select for single cells , which avoids the noise on the high-intensity end caused by cell clumps . The TSL1-GFP strain was sorted based on GFP intensity . Two bins of cells , the top 10% and bottom 50% , were collected into separate 5-ml tubes for further analysis . For each sort , ~5X104 cells from each group were set aside for growth-rate assays , which were used to assess the quality of the sort by measuring the enrichment of slower-growing cells in the top 10% bin compared with the bottom 50% bin . During sorting , cells and the culture media are mixed with sheath liquid ( PBS ) to form a fine stream , which depending on the mixture proportions could lead to a non-negligible drop in glucose concentration . Yeast intracellular cAMP levels respond to extracellular glucose concentration changes at the time scale of minutes [135] . However , the fact that the growth-rate distribution of the top 10% bin still shows a significant shift toward slower growth indicates that our separations are not greatly impacted by this temporary mixing with PBS . The HSP12-mCherry; RNR3-GFP strain was prepared in the same way as for microscopy experiments . From each desired bin of GFP intensity , as well as from the ungated population , 7X104 cells were collected and then plated for growth-rate and Hsp12-mCherry fluorescence-intensity measurements . The MSN2-mRuby2 , HTB2-GFP , TSL1-mTFP1 strain was prepared in the same way as for microscopy experiments . 3X104 cells in the top 0 . 2% bin of Tsl1-mTFP1 signal were collected for microcolony assays to measure Msn2 subcellular localization and growth rate . To measure cAMP levels , FACS-sorted cells were pelleted with mild centrifugation at 2320 x g to remove PBS , then resuspended in fresh SC at 5X107 cells/ml and allowed to recover for 30 min at 30\u00b0 C . After the recovery , 20 \u03bcL of each cell culture was set aside for growth-rate assays and 0 . 5 \u03bcL was set aside for petite-frequency counting . The remaining cell culture was pelleted at 15682 x g for 30 sec , and pellets were immediately flash frozen in liquid nitrogen . Cells can be stored at -80\u00b0 C for days after this step . Cells from different FACS sessions were pooled together to extract enough cAMP for ELISA detection . During pooling , the top 10% and bottom 50% bins from the same session remained paired . Three pairs of top 10%/bottom 50% samples were measured for cAMP concentration , with three technical replicates per sample . An ELISA-based assay was used to quantify intracellular cAMP . On the day of the ELISA assay , 0 . 1 M room temperature HCl was used to resuspend cell pellets with a quick thaw . The appropriate volume of HCl was calculated based on cell number estimates from the growth-rate assay for each sample , to ensure consistency among samples in the final cell concentration as well as to ensure high precision of the denominator when estimating the cAMP concentration per cell . Resuspended cells were immediately vortexed at top speed at 4\u00b0 C for 30 min in Macherey-Nagel Nucleospin tubes containing a 1:1 mixture of type B and C beads ( Catalog Number , Type B: 740812 . 50; Type C: 740813 . 50 ) . This vortexing physically shreds yeast cells to release cell contents including cAMP . HCl deactivates any phosphodiesterases upon shredding , protecting released cAMP from catabolism . After vortexing , tubes were centrifuged at 15682 x g for 5 min and the supernatants passed through Millex Millipore 0 . 22 \u03bcm PVDF syringe filters to remove any glass debris that could not be pelleted . The filtered supernatants were used for cAMP quantification using the Enzo Direct ELISA kit ( Catalog number ADI-900-066 ) . The lme4 package in R was used to perform linear mixed-effect modeling to separate the random noise caused by biological and technical replicates from the real difference between Tsl1-high and Tsl1-low fractions [136] . To image Msn2 intracellular localization , images were captured using a 40X air objective and 1 . 5X magnification with a well mask to space out imaging fields and thereby reduce phototoxicity and photobleaching in neighboring fields . Bright-field , TXRed and GFP channels were captured . For H89 treatment , images were only collected at one time point . For measurement of Msn2 subcellular localization , images were taken at 1-min intervals for 30 min , with exposure times of 5 ms for bright-field , 500 ms for TXRed , and 2 ms for GFP . Immediately following these 30 min , a 10-h microcolony growth-rate assay was performed with only bright-field imaging at 1-h intervals . Bright-field images were processed with the same microcolony-recognition algorithm used in the growth-rate analysis to produce a binary mask identifying pixels within or outside of cells and a bounding-box binary mask identifying pixels within or outside the smallest rectangle containing each cell . Fluorescent images from the TXRed and GFP channels were imported into CellProfiler [137] along with the cell mask to segment each cell into the nucleus and the cytoplasm . Nuclear area was detected from the Htb2-GFP fluorescent signal by the Global Otsu threshold method with the nuclear diameter restricted to lie between 10 and 30 pixels . For colonies with more than one cell , such as a mother-daughter pair , individual cells were segmented by the Propagation method , which uses the number and relative positions of nuclei and the shape information from the cell mask . Full details are provided in the implemented CellProfiler project ( S1 File ) , and the data from each cell are provided in S2 File and S3 File . Msn2-mRuby2 pixel intensities were then recorded for each compartment in each cell . The relative Msn2 nuclear abundance for H89 treatment was calculated as the ratio of the median intensity in the nucleus to the median intensity in the cytoplasm ( S2 File ) . For measurement of Msn2 subcellular localization , it was necessary to include an additional background correction , because Msn2 signal under benign conditions is not as strong . This background correction was implemented before taking the ratio by subtracting from each median intensity the median intensity within the bounding box but outside the cell ( S3 File ) . For both H89 treatment and Msn2 subcellular localization , to confirm robustness of conclusions drawn , ratios were also calculated using mean intensities or upper-quartile intensities , rather than median intensities; conclusions did not differ so only the ratios using the median are reported . For the experiments linking Msn2 subcellular localization dynamics with microcolony growth , the cells analyzed by CellProfiler for Msn2 tracking were connected to microcolonies by their centroid coordinates . To assay survival of acute heat stress , cells were prepared the same way as for growth-rate assays . For each strain , cell density was estimated by counting cells with a hemocytometer . Based on preliminary experiments , some strains were found to have very low survival so more cells of these strains were assayed per experiment . For the FY4 , msn2 , msn4 , and msn2 msn4 strains and DMSO- or H89-treated FY4 , cells were diluted in fresh SC to 2X104 cells/ml . For the pde2 and ira2 strains , and for FY4 cultured with 8-bromo-cAMP , cells were diluted in fresh SC to 2X105 cells/ml . For each strain , the diluted cell culture was mixed well and 100 \u03bcL was immediately aliquoted into each of three or four control tubes . After remixing within each control tube , 50 \u03bcL of each was aspirated into a matched heat-shock tube . All tubes were 0 . 2-mL thin-walled tubes usually used for PCR reactions . The three or four heat-shock tubes for each strain were heat shocked for 2 min at 51\u00b0 C in a thermal cycler with heated lid . Samples were then quickly plated individually on YPD plates . Appropriately sized aliquots of each sample ( based on preliminary data on survival rates so that surviving colonies were neither too sparse nor too crowded ) were plated on individual YPD plates and incubated at 30\u00b0 C for two days . TTC agar was then overlaid to identify petites , and non-petite colonies were used to calculate survival rates ( as a ratio of number of colonies surviving heat shock to number of colonies of matched control , multiplied by the appropriate dilution factor ) . Twenty such plates without heat-shock treatment were used to estimate FY4 petite frequency by direct scoring . Heat shocks of microplates were performed similarly to those in our previous study [3] with minor changes . Preliminary experiments indicated that heating of wells on the perimeter of the plate was inconsistent with heating of wells on the interior , so none of the perimeter wells were used . Microplates were heated by resting them in preheated stainless steel shot and covering with a preheated aluminum block . Preheating was conducted in an incubator set to 70\u00b0 C , as were heat shocks , which lasted 5 min , a duration we determined to produce a final temperature of 51\u00b0 C within wells . Growth of microcolonies for 5 h before heat shock and for 15 h after heat shock was tracked as above , with the two phases of the experiment processed separately . Microcolonies from the two phases were connected subsequently by their centroid coordinates in a way that accommodated a global shift in coordinates caused by removing the microplate from the microscope and returning it . A microcolony was considered dead if its area did not increase by at least two-fold during the 15 h after heat shock .", "headings": ["Abstract", "Introduction", "Results", "Discussion", "Methods"], "keywords": ["classical mechanics", "chemical compounds", "mechanical stress", "carbohydrates", "light", "organic compounds", "glucose", "electromagnetic radiation", "dna damage", "fungi", "model organisms", "artificial light", "experimental organism systems", "energy-producing organelles", "dna", "bioenergetics", "mitochondria", "cellular structures and organelles", "research and analysis methods", "saccharomyces", "specimen preparation and treatment", "staining", "animal studies", "thermal stresses", "gene expression", "chemistry", "yeast", "physics", "biochemistry", "cell staining", "eukaryota", "cell biology", "nucleic acids", "organic chemistry", "genetics", "monosaccharides", "biology and life sciences", "yeast and fungal models", "saccharomyces cerevisiae", "physical sciences", "organisms"], "id": "journal.pgen.1007744"}
{"lay_summary": "Chikungunya virus is a re-emerging and rapidly spreading arbovirus that has caused several outbreaks in the last decade with the most recent in the Caribbean islands and the Americas beginning in 2013 infecting over 1 million individuals . The ability to monitor such epidemics would be enhanced by characterizing the viral populations that circulate within infected individuals . To do this , we deep-sequenced viral populations from infected individuals and identified minority variants present at high frequencies , as well as the presence of a novel 3\u2019 untranslated genome region ( UTR ) structure , a key determinant of chikungunya virus infectivity and evolution never before described in nature . Finally , we genetically engineered an infectious clone from this outbreak strain and established that the novel 3\u2019UTR structure increases viral replication in mosquito cells . Taken together these studies highlight the vast diversity of viral populations in infected individuals , reveal potential novel determinants of chikungunya virus biology , and provide an indispensable tool for future studies involved in viral evolution and adaptation .", "article": "Chikungunya virus ( CHIKV ) , an alphavirus and member of the Togaviridae family , is capable of causing severe febrile disease in humans . In December of 2013 the Asian Lineage of CHIKV spread from the Old World to the Americas , spreading rapidly throughout the New World . Given this new emergence in na\u00efve populations we studied the viral genetic diversity present in infected individuals to understand how CHIKV may have evolved during this continuing outbreak . We used deep-sequencing technologies coupled with well-established bioinformatics pipelines to characterize the minority variants and diversity present in CHIKV infected individuals from Guadeloupe and Martinique , two islands in the center of the epidemic . We observed changes in the consensus sequence as well as a diverse range of minority variants present at various levels in the population . Furthermore , we found that overall diversity was dramatically reduced after single passages in cell lines . Finally , we constructed an infectious clone from this outbreak and identified a novel 3\u2019 untranslated region ( UTR ) structure , not previously found in nature , that led to increased replication in insect cells . Here we preformed an intrahost quasispecies analysis of the new CHIKV outbreak in the Caribbean . We identified novel variants present in infected individuals , as well as a new 3\u2019UTR structure , suggesting that CHIKV has rapidly evolved in a short period of time once it entered this na\u00efve population . These studies highlight the need to continue viral diversity surveillance over time as this epidemic evolves in order to understand the evolutionary potential of CHIKV . \n Arthropod-borne viruses ( arboviruses ) pose an eminent threat to public health worldwide and are continuously re-emerging or spreading to uninfected areas . In particular , chikungunya virus ( CHIKV ) has recently spread to the Americas to cause an estimated 1 . 7 million cases of severe , debilitating and often chronic arthralgia after roughly 60 years of circulation within Africa and Asia [1] [2] [3] [4] . This raises questions on how CHIKV will spread , evolve , and adapt in new environments in the near future . Previous epidemics of CHIKV have been attributed to adaptive mutations within the viral glycoproteins , allowing the virus to more readily infect the Asian tiger mosquito Aedes albopictus , and thus increase its transmission throughout areas of the world harboring this mosquito species . Interestingly , the CHIKV strain that has arrived to the Americas is from the Asian lineage and does not contain these adaptive mutations as of yet . However , both Aedes aegypti and albopictus are prevalent throughout many parts of North and South America [5] that , along with an enormous na\u00efve human population , give this new strain ample opportunity to undergo adaptive evolution . Using deep-sequencing technologies , we recently characterized the evolution of CHIKV within the mosquito host , where we recapitulated the emergence of previous epidemic variants and identified novel mutations yet to be detected in nature [6] . A survey of the mutant spectra present in human clinical samples , on the other hand , has not yet been performed for CHIKV . Here , we characterize the minority variants directly from human samples , collected between week 52\u20132013 and week 5\u20132014 , by whole-genome deep sequencing . While no significant consensus changes were observed between these samples collected within a short period of time , our data reveal considerable intra-host genetic diversity . Most importantly , we identify a 3\u2019 untranslated genome region ( UTR ) duplication that may have been missed by the initial sequencing performed on the ongoing epidemic in the Americas , which seems unique among the circulating CHIKV strains around the world . \n Samples involved in this study were chosen among human serum specimens received as part of standard diagnostic and expertise activities of the arboviruses National Reference Center for French Departments of the Americas located in French Guiana . The donor samples were rendered completely anonymous and renumbered prior to preparation of extracted RNA for sequencing with only the week of sampling and island of origin retained . Of the 100 samples , 20 gave whole-genome deep sequence coverage and five others ( last five in Table 1 ) gave partial coverage and were retained for analysis , and assigned new IDs as indicated in Table 1 . 100 human sera positive for CHIKV qRT-PCR were randomly selected amongst ( 1 ) those sampled between week 52 of 2013 and week 5 of 2014 around the beginning of epidemic phase in the French Caribbean islands , and ( 2 ) those having a high viral load ( mostly between 106 and 107 copies/ml , even if some lower viral loads were added to examine whether sampling bias with respect to viral load had occurred ( Table 1 ) . One third of these samples were from Guadeloupe and two thirds from Martinique . The consensus sequences of the 20 whole-genome samples were deposited in the European Nucleotide Archive , with the accession numbers indicated in Table 1 , and accessible at http://www . ebi . ac . uk/ena/data/view/LN898093-LN898112 . Total RNA from patient serum was isolated by Trizol ( Sigma ) extraction following the manufacturer\u2019s protocol , resuspended in nuclease free water , and used directly for cDNA synthesis using the Maxima H Minus First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit ( Thermo Scientific ) with random hexamers . Following cDNA synthesis , approximately 2 kb amplicons of the CHIKV genome were amplified by Phusion DNA polymerase using the primers designed based on the published St . Martin CHIKV strain CNR20235 ( Table 2 ) ( http://www . european-virus-archive . com/article147 . html ) . Amplicons were subsequently purified via a nucleospin PCR purification kit ( Macherey-Nagel ) , quantified by picogreen , and fragmented as described previously [6] . Sequences were obtained with an Illumina NextSeq500 machine and aligned against the CNR20235 reference sequence using the ViVAn pipeline [7] , which differentiates statistically significant variants from total SNPs identified within reads . For example , patient 1 , amplicon 1 presented 2557 SNPs in the quality filtered reads along the 871 nucleotide sites sequenced , with the lowest frequencies at 0 . 00001 . ViVan statistical analysis further reduced these SNPs to 1188 with the lowest frequency at 0 . 0001 for an average read coverage of 80 , 000X . We set an additional , conservative cut-off of a minimum of 3 , 000X coverage and 0 . 001 frequency , bringing the total SNPs in this sample to 564 . Average coverages were above 70 , 000X for all samples . All samples had similar profiles to the example given above , with no apparent outliers , with 95\u2013100% of all possible SNPs represented in quality filtered reads , 36\u201348% of SNPs in ViVan filtered data and 16\u201323% of SNPs above the conservative cut-off . Variants with a frequency above 0 . 5 ( 50% of the total population ) were considered consensus changes and were added to the CNR20235 reference sequence . The consensus sequences obtained from the 20 whole-genome samples were deposited in the European Nucleotide Archive with accession numbers listed in Table 1 . To align \u201ctotal\u201d and \u201cunique\u201d reads an in-house pipeline was used . The reads were trimmed to remove low-quality bases using fastq-mcf [8] and aligned with bwa-mem [9] to an artificial reference genome consisting of the two references genomes . For tissue culture passaged virus deep-sequencing , human sera were placed directly on Vero or C6/36 cells and supernatants were collected three days post-infection for C6/36 cells or at cell death for Vero cells . Viral RNA was extracted and analyzed as described above . Full-length CHIKV sequences were aligned using the CLUSTAL W program [10] . Once aligned , the program Model Generator [11] was used to identify the optimal evolutionary model that best described our sequence dataset . Akaike information criteria and hierarchical likelihood ratio test indicated that the GTR + \u0393 + I model best fit the sequence data . Maximum-likelihood phylogenetic trees were constructed under the GTR + \u0393 + I model using software from the PhyML program [11] . As a measure of the robustness of each node , we used an approximate Likelihood Ratio Test ( aLRT ) , which demonstrates that the branch studied provides a significant likelihood against the null hypothesis that involves collapsing that branch of the phylogenetic tree but leaving the rest of the tree topology identical . aLRT was calculated using three different approaches: ( a ) minimum of Chi square-based calculations; ( b ) a Shimodaira-Hasegawa-like procedure ( SH-like ) [12] [13] , which is non-parametric , and ( c ) a combination of both ( SH-like and the minimum Chi square-based calculations ) , which is the most conservative option for these calculations . In addition , the bootstrap method was also used . Patient serum was first inoculated on the Ae . albopictus mosquito cell line C6/36 and CHIKV obtained was subsequently amplified on Vero cells to generate a working viral stock . Viral RNA was isolated by Trizol extraction and cDNA was synthesized as described above . The infectious clone was constructed using four PCR amplicons generated by Phusion DNA polymerase using the primers in Table 3 and subcloned into the plasmid containing the published Indian Ocean Lineage ( IOL ) infectious clone [14] using common restriction sites . In brief , amplicon one was subcloned into the BamHI and AgeI restriction sites of the IOL infectious clone also generating a unique AgeI restriction site in the Caribbean CHIKV infectious clone sequence . The BamHI site was then removed by site-directed mutagenesis . Amplicon two was subcloned between the two AgeI restriction sites , followed by the subcloning of three into the 3\u2019 AgeI and XhoI restriction sites . Finally , amplicon four was subcloned into the XhoI and NotI restriction sites . Each cloning precursor was Sanger sequenced and the final clone was Sanger sequenced in full . Baby Hamster Kidney ( BHK-21 ) cells and Vero cells were maintained in Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle\u2019s Media ( DMEM ) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin ( P/S ) at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2 . Ae . albopictus cells ( C6/36 and U4 . 4 ) were maintained in Leibovitz L-15 media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum , 1% P/S , 1% nonessential amino acids , and 1% tryptose phosphate broth at 28\u00b0C and 5% CO2 . Working viral stocks from the Caribbean infectious clone was generated as described previously [14] . The Caribbean strain infectious clone lacking the 3\u2019UTR duplication was commercially synthesized and supplied by the laboratory of Andres Merits . The CHIKV strain NC/2011-58 ( accession # HE806461 ) was a gift from the Institut Pasteur\u2013New Caledonia . All viruses were passaged once over BHK cells to obtain a working viral stock . Viral titers were determined by plaque assay on Vero cells as previously described [14] . The strains from Mexico , Dominican Republic and Trinidad used to confirm the presence of the 3'UTR duplication were obtained from Scott Weaver and Rubing Chen . Mammalian cells ( BHK-21 and Vero ) and insect cells ( C6/36 and U4 . 4 ) were infected with each virus at an MOI of 0 . 1 in infection media ( DMEM containing 0 . 2% bovine serum albumin , 1 mM HEPES pH 7 . 4 , and 1% P/S ) for one hour at 37\u00b0C for mammalian cells and 28\u00b0C for insect cells . Virus was subsequently removed and cells were washed twice with phosphate buffered saline ( PBS ) and complete media was added . Aliquots of the viral supernatant were taken at the indicated time points and viral titers were determined by plaque assay as described previously [14] . \n To analyze the viral diversity present within human hosts infected during the current CHIKV outbreak in the Americas , we deep-sequenced 25 viral strains from sera of infected patients from Martinique and Guadeloupe ( Table 1 ) . The samples , consisting of approximately 70% from Martinique , were taken between weeks 52\u20132013 and week 5\u20132014 and represented the same proportion of patients who were diagnosed as CHIKV positive during this time . By using our deep sequencing data we assembled the consensus sequences obtained from each patient to determine the degree of genetic variability of these strains by phylogenetic approaches . These sequences were aligned with 63 full-length CHIKV strains isolated elsewhere , representing all major CHIKV lineages . Subsequently , maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees were constructed . The results of our analysis were in agreement with previous studies [1] [15][16] , placing these viruses into the Asian Lineage of CHIKV and to cluster with the St . Martin strain CNR20236 ( Fig 1A and 1B ) . Furthermore , deep-sequencing analysis identified a variety of unique high-frequency intra-host minority variants ( at greater than 0 . 5% frequency ) in infected individuals , as well as five synonymous consensus sequence differences with respect to the initially reported strain from St . Martin , which were common to all patients ( nsP2 position 2716 , A>G; nsP3 position 4507 , C>A; position 4513 , A>G; and the 3\u2019UTR position 11952 , C>T; position 11953 , G>A ) ( Table 4 , bold ) . We then evaluated the overall genetic variability of the outbreak strain across the entire CHIKV genome . With the exception of the five consensus changes , yielding a frequency of 1 , we found a number of high-frequency minority variants scattered throughout the genome; yet the majority were unique to individual patients , suggesting they did not mediate significant adaptation at the population level . In particular , these variants were found primarily in the nonstructural proteins and 3\u2019UTR with only several variants present in the structural genes . When we analyzed low-frequency minority variants we found a diverse population containing variants with frequencies ranging from as much as 30% to less than 0 . 1% of the population . We next analyzed the specific variants in each gene ( Figs 2 and 3 ) . We found that the nonstructural proteins presented many more variants ( 56 at a frequency of at least 10% of the population ) than the structural proteins ( 5 variants at a frequency above 10% of the population ) . In particular , within nsP1 , which functions as the methyltransferase and is necessary for RNA replication , we observed eight amino acid changes and three synonymous changes in individual patients and localized variation concentrated in the methyltransferase and D3 domains . Nsp2 is a multifunctional protein serving as the viral helicase , protease , and NTPase . Although we observed considerable variation scattered across nsP2 , this protein contained six synonymous and six amino acid changes including one mutation ( G772D ) present at roughly 50% of the viral population in one individual . The nsP3 gene , which encodes a phosphoprotein required for RNA replication , contained the largest number of minority variants , with 23 total changes . These include only five synonymous changes and 18 coding changes ( Fig 2 and Table 4 ) , with several minority variants making up a considerable portion of the viral population . We noted the mutations of several serine residues in nsP3 ( S48R , S255F , and S340P ) that were present at nearly 100% in one individual that could change the phosphorylation state of the protein , as well as several charge changes ( G113R , R178Q and E415K ) that may have functional roles in RNA binding or viral replication . The viral RNA dependent RNA polymerase , nsP4 , contained 10 sequence changes with three synonymous and seven coding changes . Interestingly , one patient presented a stop codon ( L441Stop ) at 63% of the viral population that is coupled with the R178Q mutation of nsP3 mentioned above . It is possible that these mutations may function together to oblate the large amount of truncated nsP4 in this individual . In contrast , the structural genes presented fewer numbers and frequencies of minority variants , with only two nonsynonymous variants in E3 and E1 genes , with frequencies between 10 and 14 percent of the viral population ( Fig 3 ) . Given the role of the viral glycoproteins E2 and E1 in viral evolution and transmission , we looked at the overall genetic variation within these two proteins . Here , we found portions of the protein involved in protein-protein interactions ( Domains I and II of E1 , as well as the E2 and E1 stem domains ) and the transmembrane domains required for membrane binding to contain variation . Interestingly , regions flanking the fusion-loop ( amino acids 83\u2013101 ) of E1 contained more variation then the fusion-loop itself indicating that changes directly in the fusion loop are poorly tolerated . Importantly , no samples contain any significant levels of previously observed vector-adaptive mutations such as E2 L210Q , E1T98A , or E1 A226V , which could potentially facilitate dissemination of this virus in Aedes albopictus mosquitoes [17] . In addition to the variation within serum samples , we also addressed how minority variants change as they are passaged through tissue culture , a technique that is commonly used to amplify viral stocks from low-titer human samples . By passaging five different individual sera once through mammalian and insect cells , we found the number of higher-frequency variants dropped considerably from roughly 60 variants in the human samples to 15 in the tissue culture passages ( Table 5 ) . Of the 15 variants , the six consensus sequence changes were maintained in insect cells; however , passaging through mammalian cells removed the two consensus changes in nsP3 ( positions 4507 and 4513 ) . Furthermore , passaging virus through tissue culture cells also identified five novel variants not found in the human samples . These included two synonymous changes in E2 ( position 8874 , C>T ) and E1 ( position 10104 , G>A ) , as well as three coding changes in nsP2 ( G460S , 37% of the population in mammalian cells ) , nsP4 ( L455M , 95% of the population in insect cells ) , and E1 ( G274V , 95% of the population in mammalian cells ) in unique sera passages . When we compared the variants between serum and tissue cultured passages of the same samples , we found that the high-frequency variants present in the sera were indeed maintained over passaging . Finally , passaging each virus a single time through mammalian cells maintained more diversity than passaging virus once through insect cells ( Fig 4 , bottom graphs in each panel ) , something that has been seen previously when looking at viral adaptation between such disparate hosts [14] . Taken together , these data shed light on variable hot spots within the CHIKV genome , identified novel variants circulating at high frequency in individuals , and suggests that if wildtype-like population diversity is desired , it may be best to passage viral strains through highly-permissive mammalian cell lines . In addition to characterizing the viral diversity present in the coding regions of the CHIKV genome , we also examined the diversity within the noncoding untranslated regions ( UTR ) ( Fig 5 ) . To begin , we analyzed the well-conserved 5\u2019UTR ( Fig 5A ) and 3\u2019 subgenomic promoter ( Fig 5B ) and found only slight variations in these regions ( frequencies ranging from 0 . 01 to 10% in the 5\u2019UTR and 0 . 01 to 1% in the subgenomic promoter ) , suggesting that RNA secondary structure in these regions is maintained and may be important for viral replication . In contrast , we found a higher degree of genetic diversity within the 3\u2019UTR . Interestingly , when we initially aligned the deep sequencing reads to the published St . Martin strain of CHIKV , we observed a near doubling of read coverage mapping to a region in the 3'UTR , spanning the 1+2a and 1+2b repeat regions ( Fig 5D , Asian Lineage ) , suggesting that this region may have been duplicated . Examination of filtered reads that did not properly align to the original reference sequence identified reads that overlapped the expected junction site where the duplication would have occurred . Indeed , this 177 nucleotide duplication was confirmed by Sanger sequencing of RT-PCR amplicons and mapped to a duplication of the 3\u2019 portion of the 1+2a region and complete 1+2b region ( Fig 5D , Caribbean Lineage ) . Subsequently , when we generated a new reference sequence containing the expected duplication for alignment of deep-sequencing data , the reads that originally could not map to the genome now mapped perfectly to the duplication in all patients where sequence data were available ( Fig 5D and 5E ) . This duplication was found in patients presenting both low and high viremia . Importantly , we confirmed this duplication by RT-PCR in CHIKV clinical samples from Mexico , the Dominican Republic and Trinidad ( Fig 5F ) , suggesting that this novel genetic element is present in samples throughout the Caribbean islands and Americas . To understand the function and evolutionary potential of these novel minority variants and RNA structural elements , we constructed an infectious clone of this virus ( Fig 6A ) as well as obtained an infectious clone lacking the 3\u2019UTR duplication ( Caribbean-\u22063\u2019UTR Duplication ) . Similar to what has been published previously , we found both of these viruses to replicate similarly to another Asian lineage of CHIKV ( NC-2011 ) in mammalian cells ( Fig 6B ) [19] . However , in mosquito cells we found the Caribbean strain containing the 3\u2019UTR duplication to have a roughly 10-fold growth advantage over the Asian strain as well as a Caribbean strain lacking the 3\u2019UTR duplication ( Fig 6C ) . These data suggest that the 3\u2019UTR duplication not only has no negative impact on viral replication , but that this novel element directly provides an advantage to Asian strains in insects . Prior historic duplications in the 3\u2019UTR are believed to have allowed the Asian genotype to recover from genetic drift after its introduction from Africa in the late 19th or early 20th century [19] . This infectious clone , containing the correct 3'UTR of the American strain of CHIKV , will provide a powerful tool in which to study pathogenesis and evolution . \n In this study we characterized the minority variants and viral populations within CHIKV-infected individuals from the recent Caribbean islands outbreak . It should be noted that the whole-genome analysis presented here was obtained from generally high viremia samples , which could possibly bias the observed diversity . Here we show that genetic diversity is spread throughout the coding region of the CHIKV genome , with higher levels of variation , including amino acid changes , in some non-structural proteins such as nsP3 . Given the relatively low frequency of most of these variants ( <10% ) , these mutations likely represent de novo generated neutral or lower fitness variants that would be purified during transmission bottlenecks . It is well known that the majority of mutations in RNA viruses bear a negative fitness cost [20] [21] . In our own study , human samples presented thousands of variants , over 80% of which had frequencies below 0 . 5% , yet above the background noise of sequencing . Most of the variants presenting stop mutations that would result in non viable virus are within this group . The variants presented here likely retained some level of replicative capacity , yet not sufficient fitness to outcompete the master sequence . It will be interesting to further characterize these variants in the context of the infectious clone , which we have developed to better understand how these variants may function in CHIKV pathogenesis and disease . Our data also indicate that a considerable loss of diversity present within human samples occurs after even a single passage in cell culture , especially in C6/36 mosquito cells . Even a single amplification in cell culture passage , although often necessary for diagnostics and surveillance , may thus introduce artifacts or purify previously existing minority variants that were in the process of emerging in human samples . Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the strains collected in Guadeloupe and Martinique islands belong to the Asian genotype circulating in the Caribbean . Furthermore , the strains sequenced in this study show a closer phylogenetic relationship , which can be attributed to the short genetic distances depicted in their tree branches . We observed strains from Brazil ( TR206 and AMA2798 ) and Mexico ( InDRE_4CHIK and InDRE_51CHIK ) to cluster with our cohort as well . Interestingly , the strain InDRE_4CHIK in Mexico was obtained from an imported case from Antigua and Barbuda , islands in close geographic proximity to Guadeloupe and Martinique [22] [23] and the strain from Brazil ( TR206 ) was obtained from a patient who had recently traveled to Guadeloupe [15] . Finally , our phylogenetic analysis supports previous hypothesis about the introduction of CHIKV into the Americas by a single entry event of the Asian genotype [15] . Moreover , whereas previous analyses focused on amino acid changes that may impart a functional or enzymatic impact , we also analyzed variation in the noncoding , untranslated regions of the genome . In this analysis , we identified a novel 3\u2019UTR duplication that had not previously been observed in nature , yet is present in several viruses circulating in the Americas including Mexico , the Dominican Republic and Trinidad . The fact that we have found this duplication in clinical samples from 2013 and again in 2015 suggests this duplication is fixed in the current circulating Caribbean strain . Importantly , we found this new UTR structure to provide no disadvantage for the virus and interestingly , it led to increases in viral titers in mosquito cells when compared to a similar Asian strain and a Caribbean strain clone lacking the duplication . As the 3\u2019UTR has been shown to play essential roles in arbovirus replication , evolution , and host adaptation [19] [24] , it will be interesting to dissect the role of this novel structure in its ability to specifically infect mosquitoes native to these affected areas as well as its ability to affect pathogenesis in humans . These studies highlight the need to carefully re-analyze deep-sequencing assemblies , such as sudden increases in read coverage and the inability to map unfiltered reads that still contain virus-specific sequences , which may be indicative of duplications and insertions . The origins of this duplication still needs to be determined to understand if it first originated in Asia prior to arriving in the Caribbean , or was generated just before or after December 9 , 2013 , the start of the epidemic in St . Martin [25] and has since spread throughout the Americas due to a fitness advantage . These scenarios are both possible as chikungunya virus was first observed in Martinique on December 19 , 2013 and Guadeloupe on December 28 , 2013 and our earliest sample analyzed in this study was on December 26 , 2013 , shortly after its spread to Martinique . In either case , a population bottleneck was involved that may have facilitated the fixation of this beneficial insertion . Nonetheless , this study provides an in depth look at the minority variants present during an ongoing chikungunya virus epidemic , identifying novel variants and structural elements , and the construction of an infectious clone of this virus to be used to future study the pathogenesis , adaptation and evolution of chikungunya virus in the Americas . The study of these evolutionary elements , which may play crucial roles in chikungunya virus evolution and adaptation , will be necessary to address potential future public health issues both in disease and viral dissemination .", "headings": ["Abstract", "Introduction", "Methods", "Results", "Discussion"], "keywords": ["sequencing techniques", "infographics", "organismal evolution", "medicine and health sciences", "pathology and laboratory medicine", "togaviruses", "chikungunya infection", "pathogens", "geographical locations", "microbiology", "cloning", "alphaviruses", "viruses", "north america", "chikungunya virus", "rna viruses", "phylogenetic analysis", "microbial evolution", "molecular biology techniques", "caribbean", "research and analysis methods", "sequence analysis", "infectious diseases", "computer and information sciences", "sequence alignment", "medical microbiology", "microbial pathogens", "molecular biology", "viral evolution", "molecular biology assays and analysis techniques", "people and places", "data visualization", "virology", "viral pathogens", "graphs", "biology and life sciences", "viral diseases", "evolutionary biology", "organisms"], "id": "journal.pntd.0004402"}

Here , we identify UBTOR , a previously unannotated gene as a functional player in regulating cell growth and mTOR signaling . Reduction of UBTOR function in cultured hippocampal neurons and PC12 cells promotes neurite outgrowth . UBTOR depletion activates mTOR signaling and promotes cell growth , whilst UBTOR overexpression suppresses colony formation in cancer cell lines .

Lastly , UBTOR depletion promotes tumor growth and mTOR signaling in a xenograft mouse model . Together , our results demonstrate how UBTOR regulates cell growth and neoplasia via mTOR signaling . \n Mechanistic target of rapamycin ( mTOR ) signaling is a central pathway that controls cell metabolism , growth , proliferation and survival . Clinically the mTOR pathway is implicated in human diseases including tumor formation , obesity , epilepsy , autism and neurodegeneration [1\u20133] . mTOR signaling activity is regulated by various factors at multiple cellular organelles [4] . The central catalytic protein mTOR forms two complexes mTORC1 and mTORC2 through interactions with a number of proteins . These mTOR interacting proteins exert important regulatory roles on mTOR activity . A protein of interest is DEPTOR , a component of both mTOR complexes and an inhibitor of mTOR signaling found only in the vertebrate species [5] . DEPTOR is phosphorylated and ubiquitylated when mTORC1 signaling pathway is activated by serum stimulation , which subsequently results in its degradation [6\u20138] . Here , we identify Ubtor as a functional player in regulating cell growth and mTOR signaling . Ubtor is a vertebrate-specific , previously unannotated gene except being listed as a downregulated or mutated gene in tumor tissues [9\u201311] . Ubtor encodes a protein without any known functional domains . We first show reductions of Ubtor expression levels in cultured hippocampal neurons and PC12 cells promote neurite outgrowth . In addition , UBTOR depletion promotes cell growth in HEK293T and U87MG cells , whilst UBTOR overexpression suppresses colony formation in HEK293T and T24 cells . We next show reduction of Ubtor promotes mTOR signaling . Mechanistic studies in cultured cells show UBTOR interacts with DEPTOR and mTOR complexes . Further studies show UBTOR stabilizes DEPTOR and regulates DEPTOR\u2019s ubiquitination . Lastly , ubtor gene disruption in zebrafish increases mTOR activity and aggravates HRAS ( G12V ) induced neoplasia in the intact animals . In parallel , Ubtor depletion promotes tumor growth and mTOR signaling in xenograft-bearing mice . Together , our results demonstrate how Ubtor regulates cell growth and neoplasia via mTOR signaling . \n kiaa1024/ubtor was identified in a zebrafish enhancer-trap screen aimed to isolate genes with expression in the central nervous system ( see Materials and Methods ) . It was an unannotated gene and present in the vertebrate species only . In situ hybridization results showed ubtor was expressed in the brain and spinal cord in the zebrafish ( S1 Fig ) . RT-PCR results showed ubtor was additionally expressed in other tissues including internal organs in the zebrafish . Based on expression data from the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas 12] and the GENSAT [13] , Ubtor gene expression patterns in the nervous system appeared conserved between the zebrafish and the mouse . To investigate the function of Ubtor , we examined neurite outgrowth in rat primary hippocampal neurons ( Fig 1 ) . Fluorescence dye Cy3 labeled small interference RNA ( Cy3-siRNA ) was transfected into the dissociated hippocampal neurons to knock down Ubtor expression levels ( Fig 1C ) , and the outgrowth of the neurites were revealed by acetylated tubulin stain and measured at 36 hours post in vitro culture ( HIV ) and 56 HIV ( Fig 1A and S2A Fig ) . The results showed the neurite outgrowth length was almost twice long in Ubtor knock-down hippocampal neurons compared with neurons transfected with control siRNA at 36 HIV ( Fig 1B ) . Longer neurite outgrowth length was also observed in Ubtor knock-down hippocampal neurons at 56 HIV ( S2A Fig ) . We next examined the nerve growth factor ( NGF ) induced neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells [14] . We tested both PC12 cells and a PC12 subline ( ld-PC12 ) , in which the expression level of Ubtor was higher than that in the PC12 cell line ( S2D Fig ) . Interestingly , NGF treatment increased Ubtor mRNA levels by about six-fold in the ld-PC12 cells ( Fig 1F ) . Small interference RNA ( siRNA ) was transfected into the ld-PC12 cells to knock down Ubtor expression levels ( Fig 1G ) . After the transfected cells were treated with NGF for 48 hours , the neurite outgrowth length doubled in Ubtor knock-down cells compared with cells transfected with control siRNA ( Fig 1D and 1E ) . Enhanced neurite outgrowth was also observed when Ubtor function was inhibited in the PC12 cells ( S2B Fig ) . UBTOR was listed as a downregulated or mutated gene in tumor tissues in previous studies [9\u201311] . Expression analyses in human cancer samples by the Xena Browser ( http://xena . ucsc . edu ) and the FireBrowse ( http://firebrowse . org/ ) tools showed UBTOR was markedly downregulated in adrenocortical cancer , pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma , and glioma ( S3 Fig ) . Thus we examined effects of UBTOR reduction in cultured human cells by lentivirus mediated shRNA knockdowns ( Fig 2B ) . The results showed UBTOR knock-down promoted proliferation in human HEK293T cells and human glioblastoma U87MG cells ( Fig 2A ) . In addition , UBTOR knock-down also promoted colony formation in HEK293T cells ( Fig 2C ) . In contrast , overexpression of UBTOR decreased colony formation in both the carcinoma T24 cells and the HEK293T cells ( Fig 2D ) . In PC12 cells , NGF mainly acts through TrkA receptor to promote neurite outgrowth . Activated TrkA receptor functions through two major downstream signaling pathways: Ras-MAPK and PI3K pathways [15\u201318] . We found no difference in the phosphorylation levels of ERK1/2 , a crucial kinase of the Ras-MAPK signaling pathway , between the Ubtor knock-down and control PC12 cells ( S4B Fig ) . One important downstream target of PI3K is the mTOR complex . Phosphorylation level of RPS6 ( p-S6 ) , a read-out of mTORC1 activity , was marked higher in the Ubtor knock-down ld-PC12 cells before NGF treatment ( Fig 3A ) . One or 3 hours after NGF was added , the p-S6 levels were increased in both the Ubtor knock-down and control cells , with higher levels in the Ubtor knock-down cells . With longer NGF treatment at 6 hours and 12 hours , the p-S6 level decreased in control cells , while in Ubtor knock-down cells the high p-S6 level was maintained ( Fig 3A and 3B ) . NGF-induced p-S6 up-regulation was abolished by co-treatment of mTORC1 specific inhibitor rapamycin ( Fig 3A and 3B ) . Consistent with mTORC1 activation , the cell diameters of the ld-PC12 cells with reduced Ubtor expression were larger than those of the control cells ( Fig 3D ) . In contrast to p-S6 , the phosphorylation level of AKT ( S473 ) , a read-out of mTORC2 activity , was slightly higher in the Ubtor knock-down cells ( Fig 3A ) . Similar increases of p-S6 levels were observed in the PC12 cells when Ubtor was knocked-down; and rapamycin treatment blocked S6 phosphorylation ( S4A Fig ) . Similar to results in the PC12 cells , the phosphorylation levels of ERK1/2 were not changed in HEK293T cells with reduced UBTOR expression ( S4C Fig ) . Phosphorylation levels of p70 S6K ( p-S6K ) , another read-out of mTORC1 activity , were significantly higher in UBTOR knock-down cells upon serum stimulation and rapamycin treatment blocked S6K phosphorylation in both the control and the UBTOR knock-down cells ( Fig 3C ) . HEK293T cells with reduced UBTOR expression were also larger than control cells ( Fig 3D ) . Protein sequence analysis tools indicated UBTOR was a transmembrane protein with most amino acid residues located in the cytoplasm . Subcellular localization results confirmed UBTOR was localized to the endoplasmic reticulum and the plasma membrane , with the bulk of protein on the cytoplasm side ( Fig 4A and S5 Fig ) . We investigated whether UBTOR interacted with the mTOR complex . We first co-transfected HeLa cells with tagged UBTOR and mTOR components and examined their subcellular co-localization . Under basal growth condition , UBTOR co-localized with exogenously expressed DEPTOR , RPTOR , and MLST8 proteins ( Fig 4B ) . We next validated an antibody that recognized endogenous mTOR protein ( S6 Fig ) . We found upon serum stimulation or treatment of phenylarsine oxide ( PAO ) , a chemical activator of mTORC1 signaling pathway [19 , 20] , co-localization between UBTOR and endogenous mTOR was observed ( Fig 4C ) . We further examined UBTOR-mTOR complex interaction by co-immunoprecipitation . Under basal growth condition , FLAG-tagged UBTOR co-precipitated with endogenously expressed DEPTOR protein , but not other components of mTOR complex ( Fig 5A ) . Reciprocally , exogenously-expressed DEPTOR co-immunoprecipitated with endogenously expressed UBTOR ( Fig 5B ) . Interestingly , when PAO was added to activate mTOR signaling , UBTOR co-immunopreciptations with endogenous DEPTOR , mTOR , RPTOR and MLST8 were observed ( Fig 5A ) . Finally , we found the N terminal region of UBTOR ( UBTOR1-467 ) strongly immunoprecipitated with endogenous DEPTOR under basal growth condition , and PAO treatment enhanced interactions between UBTOR1-467 and components of mTOR complexes ( Fig 5C ) . Bacteria-source purified UBTOR1-467 directly interacted with the PDZ domain of DEPTOR ( Fig 5D ) . These results indicated that UBTOR constitutively interacted with DEPTOR , and UBTOR may form stable interaction with the mTOR complexes under serum or PAO stimulated conditions . DEPTOR is an inhibitor of mTORC1 and mTORC2 [5 , 21] . DEPTOR is phosphorylated and ubiquitylated when mTOR signaling pathway is activated by serum stimulation , which results in its degradation [6\u20138] . In the PC12 cells , the expression level of DEPTOR was reduced by 40% after 6 hours treatment of NGF ( Fig 6A ) , consistent with degradation of DEPTOR caused by mTOR activation . Compare with the 40% reduction in the control cells , when UBTOR level was knocked down , the expression level of DEPTOR was reduced more than five-fold before and throughout the NGF treatment ( Fig 6A ) . Thus , these marked reductions in UBTOR knockdown cells could not solely be due to mTOR signaling activation and subsequent DEPTOR degradation . Alternatively , UBTOR might stabilize DEPTOR by its direct interaction with DEPTOR . In agreement with UBTOR\u2019s stabilization effect on DEPTOR , knockdown of UBTOR in HEK293T cells caused significant reduction of DEPTOR under basal growth condition ( Fig 6B ) . To further examine this issue , we transiently expressed DEPTOR in HEK293T cells and found when UBTOR was co-expressed with DEPTOR , DEPTOR\u2019s expression level was increased ( Fig 6C ) . The transmembrane domain of UBTOR ( \u0394896\u2013916 ) was dispensable for the stabilization effect on DEPTOR , whilst further deletion into the C terminal region of UBTOR protein ( \u0394852\u2013916 ) abrogated this stabilization effect ( Fig 6C ) . As expected , the UBTOR1-467 N terminal region was required for the full stabilization effects of DEPTOR ( Fig 6D ) , because UBTOR1-467 interacted with DEPTOR ( Fig 5 ) . The middle region of UBTOR ( 468\u2013773 ) was not required for the stabilization of DEPTOR ( Fig 6E ) . Previous studies have shown DEPTOR was degraded through ubiquitin-proteasome pathway [6\u20138] . Thus , UBTOR may stabilize DEPTOR by regulating ubiquitination of DEPTOR . Indeed , UBTOR reduced the ubiquitination level of DEPTOR when they were co-expressed in HEK293T cells ( Fig 6F and 6G ) . To investigate Ubtor\u2019s functions in intact animals , ubtor gene was disrupted in zebrafish by TALEN and CRISPR/Cas9 mediated mutagenesis ( see Materials and Methods ) . The targeted gene disruption resulted in frame-shift and multiple stop codons in the Ubtor coding sequence . Thus no functional Ubtor protein could be made in the homozygous mutant . The homozygous ubtor mutant had no gross developmental abnormalities . They were of similar sizes as their wild type siblings and were fertile under standard raising and maintaining conditions . Results from behavior tests showed ubtor mutant had enhanced fear-evoked freezing and compromised C-start responses ( S7 Fig ) , suggesting ubtor mutation had subtle but significant effects on neurodevelopment and animal physiology . To determine if UBTOR\u2019s regulation of mTOR signaling also occur in intact animals , we examined p-S6K levels in ubtor mutant and control larvae at 5 dpf , and found p-S6K was increased approximately 4-fold in the brains of ubtor mutant compared with the controls ( Fig 7A ) . To further examine the effects of ubtor mutation on the mTOR signaling , zebrafish of 13 . 5 dpf were fasted for 12 hours to down-regulate , then refed with ample food for 12 hours to activate the mTOR activities . The brain tissues of fasted and fed zebrafish were analyzed for the levels of p-S6K and p-S6 . Similar to results in rodents , food-deprivation reduced the levels of p-S6K and p-S6 , and feeding restored those phosphorylation levels . The ubtor mutation caused significantly higher levels of p-S6K and p-S6 in the fasted animals , and significantly higher p-S6 levels in the refed animals ( Fig 7B ) . Thus , ubtor mutation caused significant upregulation of the mTOR signaling in the intact animals . HRAS ( G12V ) , a dominant-active form of human oncogene HRAS , can promote tumor formation when overexpressed in zebrafish embryos [22] . Consistent with the in vitro effects of UBTOR knockdowns on cell growth and colony formation in the cultured cells , microinjection of the HRAS ( G12V ) construct into zebrafish ubtor mutant embryos increased neoplasia rate to over 70% compared with about 30% for the injection into the wild type controls ( Fig 7C ) . In total , 19 out of the 59 wild type control zebrafish developed tumors , whilst 26 out of the 37 ubtor mutants had tumors ( \u03c712 = 13 . 23 , P < 0 . 001 ) . To further examine effects of UBTOR depletion on tumor growth in a mammalian model , we injected nude mice with U87MG cells . UBTOR-depleted U87MG cells formed significantly larger tumors than the control cells did in the nude mice ( Fig 8A and 8B ) . Histopathology results showed UBTOR-depleted KD tumors were composed of pleomorphic cells featuring high cell density and high nuclear-cytoplasmic ratio ( Fig 8C ) . The Ki-67 indexes were also significantly higher in the UBTOR-depleted KD tumors ( Fig 8D ) . These features were consistent with high malignancy . Immunoblot results showed expression levels of S6 and p-S6 were elevated 4- and 3-fold in the UBTOR-depleted tumors ( Fig 8E ) . Thus , UBTOR depletion promoted tumor growth and mTOR signaling in the xenograft mouse model . \n In this study , UBTOR depletion promotes neurite and cellular growth , whilst UBTOR overexpression suppresses colony formation in cancer cell lines . Mechanistic studies in cultured cells revealed UBTOR stabilized DEPTOR , a component of the mTOR complexes , to inhibit the mTOR signaling . Investigations in the zebrafish model further showed disruption of ubtor gene upregulated the mTOR signaling and promoted HRAS ( G12V ) mediated tumor formation in intact animals . Similarly , UBTOR depletion promoted tumor growth and mTOR signaling in a xenograft mouse model . These findings demonstrate how Ubtor regulates cellular growth and neoplasia via mTOR signaling . Ubtor is an unannotated gene and present in the vertebrate species only . It encodes a protein without any known functional domains despite of exhaustive sequence homology-based searches [23\u201325] . Ubtor protein is highly conserved in the vertebrates , with the shark protein shares 55% identities with the human protein . Searches of protein prediction servers [26\u201327] and protein-protein interaction databases [28] provided no clues into the function of Ubtor protein . No previous studies have indicated the function of the Ubtor gene or protein product , except that UBTOR gene was listed as one of the top down-regulated genes in adrenocortical adenoma [10] , and a top-ranked mutated gene in pancreatic cancer [9 , 11] . Expression analyses of human tumor samples also indicated UBTOR was markedly downregulated in adrenocortical cancer , pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma , and glioma . The present study highlights Ubtor\u2019s functions in the cellular growth and the mTOR signaling . Abnormal activation of the mTOR signaling may provide explanation why UBTOR is downregulated or mutated in tumor tissues . Consistent with this view , our results show UBTOR knock-down promote growth in HEK293T and U87MG cells , and overexpression of UBTOR reduced colony formation in both the HEK293T cells and the carcinoma T24 cells . Enhancement of HRASG12V mediated tumor formation in the homozygous ubtor zebrafish mutant and larger xenograft tumor growth of UBOTR-depleted U87MG cells in the nude mice further support involvement of Ubtor in neoplasia . Interestingly , we show that NGF treatment in PC12 cells upregulate Ubtor expression . The induction of higher Ubtor expressions levels upon mTOR signaling activation may keep the mTOR signaling activity in check . Thus , Ubtor constitutes a novel negative feedback mechanism [29\u201331] to control mTOR signaling . mTOR signaling activity is tightly regulated by various interacting proteins of the catalytic mTOR protein . DEPTOR is an integral component of both mTOC complexes and it functions an inhibitor of the mTOR signaling . Previous studies show that DEPTOR is ubiquitylated when mTOR signaling pathway is activated , which results in its degradation [6\u20138] . Our results show that UBTOR reduces ubiquitination of DEPTOR and stabilizes DEPTOR expression levels . Because the N terminal UBTOR1-467 binds to DEPTOR , a parsimonious model may indicate UBTOR is a deubiquitinating enzyme ( DUB ) . Standard sequence-based homology searches fail to reveal an existence of DUB domain or any other functional domains in the UBTOR protein [23] , neither do other specialized methods meant to detect remote homologies [24 , 25] . However , the primary sequences of DUB are diverse [32 , 33] . Future studies will be required to determine if DUBTOR harbors deubiquitinating activity , or other mechanisms such as interference with the DEPTOR E3 ligase SCF [34] or trapping of mTOR complexes on the endoplasmic reticulum are involved . In summary , our study provides insights into how Ubtor regulate cellular growth and mTOR signaling . Manipulations of Ubtor function may potentially be utilized to optimize mTOR signaling activities for treatments of cancers and other diseases . \n The animal use protocols were reviewed and approved by the The Fudan University Shanghai Medical College Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee ( 110307\u2013084 , 130227\u2013092 , and 150119\u2013088 ) . All animals were handled in accordance with the NRC Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the Fudan University Regulations on Animal Experiments . Zebrafish were maintained in a recirculating water system according to standard protocols [35] . Lines used in this study include AB , Tg ( UAS:EGFP ) , Tg ( ubtor:GAL4FF ) , and ubtor mutant . The wild type ( wt ) AB line was obtained from the University of Oregon Zebrafish Facility . The Tg ( UAS:EGFP ) line was a gift from K . Kawakami [36] . The Tg ( ubtor:GAL4FF ) line was obtained from an enhancer trap screen , and the ubtor mutant line was generated by targeted gene disruption , both using the AB line as the subject ( see below ) . The enhancer-trap vector used in this study contains minimal transposable elements of Tol2 , a super core basal promoter , and coding sequence for a modified version of Gal4 transcriptional activator [37] . A mixture of the enhancer-trap vector and Tol2 transposase mRNA was microinjected into one-cell stage embryos . Transgenic founder fish were identified and selected based on EGFP expression patterns after crossing the injected fish with a Tg ( UAS:EGFP ) reporter line . Transgenic founder fish were outcrossed with the AB line for three generations before high-efficiency thermal asymmetric interlaced PCR [38 , 39] was used to map the genomic insertion site of the enhancer trap vector . In the Tg ( ubtor:GAL4FF ) line , the enhancer-trap vector was mapped to the second intron of an uncharacterized gene on chromosome 7 , which was subsequently named ubtor as results showed its protein product regulated protein ubiquitination and mTOR signaling . The mammalian Kiaa1024/Ubtor gene has two orthologs in the zebrafish genome . The trapped ortholog on chromosome 7 has a higher sequence identity to the mammalian sequences and was named ubtora ( 59% identity to the human protein sequence ) . The other ortholog on chromosome 18 was named ubtorb ( 26% identity to the human protein sequence ) . In situ hybridization results showed the ubtorb gene was transiently expressed in the Rohn-Beard cells between 24 and 72 hpf , and in a few cells in the trigeminal region after 72 hpf . Thus , it was unlikely to play significant roles in experiments in this study . To simplify the descriptions , the zebrafish ubtora gene was referred to as ubtor throughout this manuscript . To disrupt the ubtor gene in the zebrafish , three lesions were introduced into the zebrafish genome via the TALEN [40] and CRSPR/Cas9 mediated targeted gene modifications ( see S1 Table for target site sequences and lesion information ) . This produced a 7-base deletion at position 22 , a 10-base deletion at position 1319 , and a 7-base insertion at position 1989 into the coding sequence of ubtor . These three frame-shift mutations introduced multiple stop codons to the Ubtor coding sequence . Thus , no functional protein product can be made in the homozygous mutant . This ubtor mutant line ( ubtord10 ) was outcrossed with the AB line for 5 generations and then used in this study . The primer sequences , the target sequences and sources of siRNAs and Lentiviral shRNAs were listed in S1 Table . Plasmid constructs were generated via standard cloning methods . Construct descriptions , sources of antibodies and cell lines were listed in S2 Table . Operant conditioning was carried out using an apparatus built from a published design with modifications [41] . Briefly , four tanks of 13 cm x 5 cm x 5 cm ( L x W x H ) were placed on top of a LCD screen . Single zebrafish of 2 month old were placed into each tank with water 3 cm deep . During a 10 min adaptation period , a visual cue ( blue checkerboard ) was presented by the LCD screen on one side of each box for 10 sec and then on the other side for 10 sec . No electric shock was given during adaptation . During the conditioning period , the visual cue was presented on one side of each box . Free-moving zebrafish received a 0 . 2 sec 0 . 8V/cm electric shock whenever it entered the visual conditioned side of the tank and lingered for more than 0 . 5 sec . A 5 sec break period was provided after each shock , and the maximal number of shocks received by a fish within one minute period was limited to 3 . The conditioning period lasted for 15 min , and two conditioning session were given , with the visual cue switching to the other side in the second session . Then the visual cue was removed for 30 min . For retrieval test , the CS visual cue was presented on one side of each box for 2 min . No electric shock was given during retrieval . During the entire test , a computer running MATLAB scripts took live images from an infra-red camera at 10 frames per second , tracked the fish movements , presented the visual cues , and delivered the electric shocks . C-start response was carried out using an apparatus built from a published design with modifications [42] . Briefly , a 5 by 4 test grid was laser-cut onto a 70 mm x 50 mm x 2 mm ( L x W x T ) acrylic plate . A small vibrator rated at 12 , 000 rpm was fixed into the acrylic plate and driven by an Arduino micro-controller . The plate was placed on top of four steel balls and positioned by blocks on four corners . After each grid well was filled with single 5 dpf zebrafish , a 20\u201350 ms long current was sent to the vibrator to shake the plate and elicit C-starts . A high speed camera recorded the C-start response at 400\u2013500 frames per second . Preliminary tests showed ubtor mutant fish exhibited reduced C-start after repetitive stimulations . Thus , ten repetitive stimuli were first given at 1 second intervals , then one minute later another stimulus was delivered and the C-start responses were recorded and analyzed . Primary hippocampal neurons were dissected from day 18 embryonic Sprague Dawley ( SD ) rats and cultured using a previously reported method [43] . Briefly , hippocampus was dissected out by fine forceps and digested in 0 . 05% trypsin-EDTA solution for 15 minutes in a 37\u2009\u00b0C incubator . Digestion was stopped by DMEM/F12 medium with 10% FBS and neurons were collected by centrifuging at 1000 rpm for 8 minutes and re-suspended in DMEM/F12 medium with 10% FBS . Then neurons were plated on coverslips coated with poly-D-lysine at a density of 4 x 104 cells/cm2 . Twelve hours later , culture medium was replaced by neurobasal medium supplemented with 2% B27 ( GIBCO , Life Technologies ) . siRNAs were transfected at the time of cell plating using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX ( Thermos Scientific ) . Cells were lysed in 2 x SDS sample buffer ( 100 mM Tris-HCl pH 6 . 8 , 4% SDS , 0 . 02% bromophenol blue , 20% glycerol and 200 mM DTT ) then boiled at 95\u00b0C for 10 min . Proteins in cell lysates were resolved by 6%-20% SDS-PAGE , and tank-transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes . Membranes were probed with the primary antibodies overnight and detected with HRP conjugated secondary antibodies ( see S2 Table ) . Immuno-signals were developed by enhanced chemiluminescence , recorded by a FluorChem E system ( ProteinSimple ) , and analyzed by ImageJ . For immunoprecipitation , cell lysates were incubated with anti-FLAG-M2 beads ( Sigma-Aldrich ) or anti-HA-beads ( Sigma-Aldrich ) at 4\u00b0C for 4 hours , and then the beads were washed with lysis buffer for 3 times . Finally , the beads were mixed with 2 x SDS sample buffer ( 100 mM Tris-HCl , pH 6 . 8 , 4% SDS , 0 . 02% bromophenol blue 20% glycerol and 200 mM DTT ) and boiled at 95\u00b0C for 10 minutes . For pull down assays , cell lysates and GST-tagged proteins purified from bacteria were mixed with glutathione Sepharose beads ( GE Life Sciences ) at 4\u00b0C for 4 hours . Beads were washed 3 times with lysis buffer and boiled with 2 x SDS sample buffer at 95\u00b0C for 10 minutes . Bacteria BL21 ( DE3 ) expressing GST-tagged or His-tagged proteins were incubated with bacterium lysis buffer ( 20 mM Tris-Cl , pH 8 . 0 , 500 mM NaCl , 1 mM DTT , 5% glycerol , 1% TritonX-100 , protease inhibitor cocktail , 300 ug/ml lysozyme ) at 4\u00b0C for 1 hour then disrupted with sonication . The lysates were cleared by centrifugation and then incubated with glutathione Sepharose or Ni-NTA Agarose beads at 4\u00b0C for 1 hour . For GST-tagged proteins , the beads were washed three times with the lysis buffer and the GST-tagged proteins were eluted with elution buffer ( 50 mM Tris-Cl , pH 8 , 150 mM NaCl , 1 mM DTT , 5% glycerol , 1% TritonX-100 ) containing 10 mM glutathione . For His-tagged protein , the beads were washed three times with the lysis buffer containing 20 mM imidazole and the His-tagged proteins were eluted with elution buffer containing 500 mM imidazole . Cells were plated at 1500 cells/well in 96-well plate . The substrate WST-8 from the CCK-8 kit ( Dojindo ) was added from 6 hours to 4 days post plating and incubated for 4 hours , followed by absorbance measurement at 450 nm . Cells were plated at 2 x 104 ( HEK293T ) or 5 x 104 ( T24 ) cells/dish in a 6 cm diameter petri-dish and then transfected with plasmid constructs as indicated . Puromycin was added to the culture medium at 1 \u03bcg/ml and then the cells were fixed and stained with 0 . 01% crystal violet after two weeks . A Tol2-pCMV-GFP-HRAS ( G12V ) plasmid mixed with Tol2 transposase mRNA was injected to zebrafish embryos at one cell stage . Fish of one month old were examined for neoplasia by fluorescence microscopy and paraffin section of the tumors . To generate xenograft tumors , a total of 1x106 U87MG cells transfected with lentivirus negative control ( NC ) or UBTOR Lenti-1 shRNAs were suspended in 100 \u03bcl of MEM medium without serum and implanted subcutaneously into the flanks of 7-week-old female BALB/c nude mice . The tumor volume was measured every other days by a digital caliper . At the end point , portions of the xenograft tumors were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde , paraffin embedded , sectioned , and subjected to hematoxylin/eosin and Ki-67 staining . The remaining tumor tissues were processed for protein extraction and subsequent immunoblot analyses . Cells were briefly washed with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 minutes at room temperature . Fixed cells were washed with PBS and then post-fixed with methanol at -20\u00b0C for 15 minutes . After permeabilization with 0 . 5% TritonX-100 in PBS for 7 min , cells were blocked with blocking solution ( PBS containing 2% sheep serum , 2% goat serum 0 . 2% BSA and 0 . 1% Tween-20 ) and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with primary antibodies diluted in blocking solution . Cells were then washed with PBS containing 0 . 1% Tween-20 and incubated with secondary antibodies ( see S1 Table ) for 2 hours at room temperature . Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficients were measured using ImageJ package Fiji . Data are expressed as mean \u00b1 sem .

While protein-protein interactions are highly informative about protein function , a global map of protein interactions and complexes is still lacking for these important human parasites . Here , benefiting from in-depth biochemical fractionation , we systematically interrogated the co-complex interactions of more than 3354 protein groups in procyclic life stage of Trypanosoma brucei , the protozoan parasite responsible for human African trypanosomiasis . Using a rigorous methodology , our analysis led to identification of 128 high-confidence complexes encompassing 716 protein groups , including 635 protein groups that lacked experimental annotation . These complexes correlate well with known pathways as well as for proteins co-expressed across the T . brucei life cycle , and provide potential functions for a large number of previously uncharacterized proteins . We validated the functions of several novel proteins associated with the RNA-editing machinery , identifying a candidate potentially involved in the mitochondrial post-transcriptional regulation of T . brucei . Our data provide an unprecedented view of the protein complex map of T . brucei , and serve as a reliable resource for further characterization of trypanosomatid proteins . The presented results in this study are available at: www . TrypsNetDB . org . \n The unicellular flagellated parasite Trypanosoma brucei is the causative agent of the fatal human African trypanosomiasis ( HAT ) , also known as sleeping sickness , and the economically devastating disease Nagana in cattle . The life cycle of T . brucei comprise an insect stage ( procyclic stage ) and a mammalian stage . Trypanosomatid parasites , including T . brucei , are highly diverged from well-studied eukaryotes such as yeast and mammals [1\u20133] , resulting in a lack of sequence similarity with model organisms for the majority of their proteins . This has led to inapplicability of homology-based approaches for identification of potential functions of more than half of all trypanosomatid genes [4] . Protein interaction maps offer an invaluable resource for functional annotation of proteins [5] . Current methodological/instrumental advances have led to the development of several ex vivo , in vivo , and in silico approaches to systematically chart protein interactions and complexes [6] . Optimized yeast two-hybrid ( Y2H ) approaches have been employed to infer pairwise interactions among proteins [7 , 8] . Immunoprecipitation [9] , biochemical fractionation [10\u201313] , and affinity purification ( AP ) -based approaches [14\u201316] are widely used for the identification of protein complexes in a specific cell context . Additionally , functional association of proteins can be predicted computationally using data types such as transcriptomics data [17] , synthetic lethality [18] , and chemical sensitivity [19] . However , each of these approaches has limitations and is inherently associated , in varying degrees , with false positive and negative results . In AP-based approaches , for example , tagging the protein may affect the binding partners of the tagged protein by inactivation , capping the binding site , or changing the localization of the protein . Highly expressed proteins are also often co-purified with the tagged protein as a false positive contaminant . Moreover , transient interactions are likely to be lost if stringent conditions are used for the purification of the tagged protein . In biochemical fractionation strategies , fortuitous interactions can arise because confounding protein complexes can still be present in the same fraction regardless of in-depth fractionation [10] . In addition to non-negligible false positive rates , the Y2H system is relatively weak at detection of co-complex associations , although it works well at capturing binary , particularly transient , interactions [20] . Therefore , the integration of data from different approaches has been shown to improve the precision of protein maps [21] . To explore the protein complexes underlying the survival and pathogenesis of T . brucei , we performed four high resolution fractionation experiments benefiting from two orthogonal , complementary biochemical approaches . High-resolution mass spectrometry analysis of the fractions led to the construction of a global co-fractionation network for T . brucei in procyclic life stage . Evaluation of the constructed network demonstrated that it has topological and biological characteristics that are similar to those observed in the sampled networks of model organisms from previous large-scale studies . Importantly , our results demonstrated significantly higher precision for those interactions that were supported by the two orthogonal fractionation approaches compared to those that co-fractionated only in one approach . To extract a high-confidence core network , we combined the fractionation-derived network with other orthogonal resources of protein-protein interaction data . This high-confidence network predicts the network context of 866 protein groups , including many hypothetical and experimentally unannotated proteins . Clustering of this high-confidence network led to the assignment of 716 protein groups to 128 complexes . To our knowledge , this study presents the largest proteomics-based interaction map of trypanosomatid parasites to date , providing a useful resource for formulating new biological hypothesises and further experimental leads . To showcase the utility of this protein complex map , we used it to reveal novel factors involved in the mitochondrial post-transcriptional regulation of T . brucei , and validated them by several independent experiments . \n Late log phase ( ~2 x 107 cells/ml ) T . brucei procyclic form IsTaR 1 . 7 A cells ( a derivative of EATRO 164 ) were grown in 225 cm2 flasks to obtain 4\u00d7109 cells . The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 6000 x g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C , and washed once with ice-cold glucose-supplemented PBS ( 6mM glucose ) . The cells were then resuspended in 500 \u03bcl lysis buffer [10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7 . 2 , 10 mM MgCl2 , 100 mM KCl , 1 \u03bcg/ml pepstatin , 1 mM DTT , 1% triton X-100 and 1 x EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail ( Roche ) ] and incubated on a tube rotator for 15 min at 4\u00b0C . The lysate was treated with 40 units of RNase-free DNase I ( Roche ) for 1 h on ice and cleared twice by centrifugation at 16 , 000x g for 15 min at 4\u00b0C . The methods for preparing the extracts were adapted from conventional purification techniques [22\u201324] . Cell pellets were washed with ice-cold glucose-supplemented PBS as above , resuspended in 30 ml DTE buffer [1 mM Tris-HCl pH 8 . 0 and 1 mM EDTA] containing a protease inhibitor cocktail ( Roche ) , and lysed using a 40 ml sterile tight-fitting Dounce-homogenizer on ice . The lysate was immediately made isotonic by adding a 2 M sucrose stock solution to a final concentration of 250 mM , and the mitochondria were centrifuged at 15 , 800 x g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C . The mitochondrial pellet was treated with 0 . 3 mM CaCl2 and 40 Us of RNase-free DNase I ( Roche ) in 4 . 6 ml STM buffer [20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8 . 0 , 250 mM sucrose and 2 mM MgCl2] for 1 hr on ice and precipitated again . The mitochondrial lysate was prepared in 500 \u03bcl lysis buffer as described above for whole cells . The supernatant obtained upon collecting mitochondria at 15 , 800 x g , represents a crude preparation of the cytosol . This was centrifuged at 100 , 000 x g for 1 h at 4\u00b0C to eliminate small organelle contamination . Whole cell and mitochondrial extracts were resolved on 10\u201330% linear glycerol gradients [40 mM HEPES pH 7 . 9 , 20 mM Mg ( OAc ) 2 , 100 mM KCl , and 2 mM EDTA] at 178 , 000x g for 6 hr at 4\u00b0C , and fractionated into 46\u201348 fractions ( 250 \u03bcl each ) , as described elsewhere [25] . Protein separation on these gradients were standardized with known amounts of BSA ( Bovine serum albumin ) , catalase and IgM ( Immunoglobulin M ) , with apparent masses of 66 KDa , 230 KDa and 970 KDa , respectively . The glycerol gradient fractions were analyzed using an Agilent 1100 series capillary LC system and a ThermoScientific LTQ linear ion trap mass spectrometer . Fifty \u03bcl portions of each fraction were concentrated to approximately 10 \u03bcl volume by vacuum centrifugation , and 30 \u03bcl of 8M urea , 1 . 0 M Tris ( pH 8 . 5 ) , 8 mM CaCl2 , and 0 . 2 M methylamine added . Cysteines were then reduced by 14 mM dithiothreitol ( DTT ) at 50\u00b0C for 15 min , and alkylated by 33 mM iodoacetamide at room temperature for 30 min . The urea concentration in the samples was then diluted to 2M concentration and trypsin ( Sigma , T6567 ) added at an approximate ratio of 1:25 enzyme:substrate during an overnight digestion . Digests were then acidified by addition of formic acid at a final 5% concentration , vacuum concentrated to approximately 25 \u03bcl and injected for LC-MS/MS analysis . Electrospray ionization was performed with no sheath gas using an ion max source fitted with a 34 gauge metal needle . Samples were applied at 20 \u03bcl/min to a trap cartridge ( Michrom BioResources , Auburn , California , USA ) and then switched onto a 0 . 5\u00d7250 mm Zorbax SB-C18 column ( Agilent ) using a mobile phase containing 0 . 1% formic acid and a 7\u201330% acetonitrile ( ACN ) gradient over 95 min , with a 10 \u03bcl/min flow rate . Peptide sequences were determined by comparing the observed MS/MS spectra to theoretical MS/MS spectra of peptides generated from a T . brucei protein database containing 9 , 826 entries ( www . tritrypdb . org , release 3 . 2 ) comprised of both forward and reversed sequences using the program Sequest ( Version 27 , rev . 12 , ThermoScientific ) . SEQUEST was configured as follows: parent ion average mass tolerance of 2 . 5 Da , fragment ion monoisotopic mass tolerance of 1 . 0 Da , tryptic enzymatic cleavage , a maximum of 2 missed cleavages , static C+57 modifications , and variable M+16 modifications . Peptides were filtered at 2% false discovery rate ( FDR ) for whole cell cytosolic samples and 5% FDR for mitochondrial samples using the PAW pipeline [26] and the target/decoy method . It should be noted that the reported peptide-to-spectrum match ( PSM ) FDRs are for the entire set of fractions in each experiment; and the FDR per fraction is much less than 1% even for the mitochondrial glycerol gradient fractionation data . During the protein identification , we created protein groups by grouping the paralogous proteins ( proteins that were generated by duplication events within the genome ) with nearly identical protein sequences together . The total number of protein groups identified in this study was 1526 , using a minimum of 2 unique peptides per protein , at a false discovery rate of about 1% for the combined fraction analysis and about 3% for the individual fraction analysis based on comparison of hits identified for forward and reverse sequences . Protein abundances were based on MS2 intensity-weighted spectral counting , which have been shown to provide accurate protein abundance estimates from LTQ linear ion trap mass spectrometer [27] . Cytosolic and mitochondrial extracts were resolved by liquid chromatography using tandem cationic ( S ) \u2013anionic ( Q ) exchange columns ( UNOsphere , Biorad ) , adapted from [10 , 28] . The mobile phase consisted of buffer A [10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7 . 8 , 10 mM MgCl2 , 50 mM KCl and 1 mM DTT] and buffer B [buffer A + 950 mM KCl] . Chromatography was performed using Beckman-Coulter Gold high performance liquid chromatography system . Samples were passed through a 0 . 22 \u03bcm membrane , loaded on the columns and then washed for 15 mins with buffer A , followed by 0\u201350% buffer B ( 1%/min ) , a 10 min wash and then 50\u2013100% buffer B ( 5%/min ) . The flow-rate was maintained at 400 \u03bcl/min , and approximately 40 fractions ( 800 \u03bcl each ) were collected . The ion exchange separated proteins were analyzed using a Dionex NCP-3200RS UltiMate RSLCnano UPLC system and Thermo Scientific Orbitrap Fusion mass spectrometer . Pairs of adjacent fractions were pooled to create approximately 20 final fractions from each cytosol and mitochondria preparation and up to 200 \u03bcl of each were dried by vacuum concentration . Samples were then digested by trypsin ( Sigma , T6567 ) as described above , except 50 \u03bcl of urea digestion buffer and an enzyme:substrate ratio of 1:10 was used . Following vacuum centrifugation to dryness , samples were dissolved in up to 100 \u03bcl of 5% formic acid , centrifuged at 16 , 000 x g for 10 min to remove particulates , and approximately 2 \u03bcg of each digest injected onto an Acclaim PepMap 100 \u03bcm x 2 cm NanoViper C18 , 5 \u03bcm peptide trap on a switching valve . After 10 min of loading at 5\u03bcl/min , the trap column was switched on-line to a PepMap RSLC C18 , 2 \u03bcm , 75 \u03bcm x 25 cm EasySpray column ( Thermo Scientific ) . Peptides were then separated using a 7 . 5\u201330% ACN gradient over 60 min in mobile phase containing 0 . 1% formic acid at a 300 nl/min flow rate and ionized using an EasySpray NanoSource ( Thermo Scientific ) . Survey scans were performed by the Orbitrap mass analyzer at a resolution of 120 , 000 , and data-dependent MS2 scans acquired by the linear ion trap in rapid mode . Data-dependant scanning used a 30 sec exclusion time , repeat count of 1 , exclusion of +1 charge ions , top speed mode , and a 3 sec dwell time between survey scans . MaxQuant ( version 1 . 5 . 2 . 8 ) was used for peptide and protein identification from Orbitrap Fusion data . MaxQuant was configured as follows: FASTA database was a T . brucei protein database containing 11 , 567 entries ( www . tritrypdb . org , release 24 . 0 ) , default decoy sequence generation , tryptic enzymatic cleavage , default parent ion and fragment ion mass tolerances , a maximum of 2 missed cleavages , static C+57 . 02 modifications , variable M+15 . 995 modifications , and target peptide FDR of 1% ( cytosolic ) or 2% ( mitochondrial ) . A high protein FDR target was chosen because MaxQuant does not compute protein FDR per sample in multi-sample experiment designs; per sample protein FDRs are much less than overall experiment-wide protein FDR when there are many samples . Protein quantification used the protein total intensity values in the MaxQuant protein summary files . We also invoked a two peptide per protein per sample ( one LC run ) criteria to reduce protein identification noise . The RNA interference ( RNAi ) vector was prepared by amplifying 433 bp fragment from the open reading frame of Tb927 . 10 . 7910 gene . The amplified fragment was introduced into p2T7-177 [29] . Linearized plasmids were transfected into procyclic form 29\u201313 cells by electroporation , and transfected cells were selected by adding 2 . 5 \u03bcg/ml pheleomycin . Growth effect in RNAi cell lines was monitored for up to 10 days in the presence and absence of 2 . 5 \u03bcg/ml tetracyclin . RNA was collected from uninduced and Tet-induced RNAi Tb927 . 10 . 7910 cell line at day-3 post induction , selected based on the observed growth defect . RNA was isolated from ~108 cells using TRIzol ( Invitrogen ) . Ten micrograms of total RNA were treated with DNA-free DNase Kit ( Ambion ) to remove any residual DNA . Purified RNA was reverse transcribed in 25 \u03bcl RT-PCR reactions including TagMan reverse transcriptase and random hexamer primers using TagMan Reverse Transcription Kit ( Applied Biosciences ) . Different RT-PCR reactions were performed with primers specific to pre-edited , edited , and never-edited mitochondrial transcripts , as described previously [30] and primers that flank the junctions of the adjacent genes , 9S/ND8 , Cyb/A6 , and RPS12/ND5 [31] using a Corbett rotor gene 3000 . Data were normalized against the 18S rRNA as an internal reference , and were confirmed for several genes considering the \u03b2-tubulin as the internal reference . Each mRNA target was analyzed in two biological replicates and three technical replicates . Relative changes in RNA abundance were calculated using \u0394\u0394Ct , as described before [32] . The sequence information for primers used in this study is provided in S1 Table . To generate C-myc-tagged cell lines , the open reading frames of Tb927 . 1 . 1730 , Tb927 . 10 . 1730 , and Tb927 . 10 . 7910 were amplified and cloned into BamHI and HpaI sites ( for Tb927 . 1 . 1730 ) or BamHI and HindIII sites ( for Tb927 . 10 . 1730 and Tb927 . 10 . 7910 ) of pHD-1700 [33] . All constructs were digested with NotI before transfection into 13\u201313 procyclic form cells . C-myc tagged cell lines were induced with 0 . 5 \u03bcg/ml tetracycline for 48 hr and then used to prepare slides for immunofluorescence analysis . Briefly , mid-log phase cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS and placed on poly-L-lysine-treated round coverslips ( Fisher ) . Cells were permeabilized with 0 . 2% Triton-X-100 in PBS and blocked with 3% BSA in PBS . Anti-myc antibody ( 1:500 ) was used to visualize myc-tagged cells . Mitotracker ( Invitrogen ) was used to stain the organelles and DAPI was used for DNA staining . Slides were analyzed using a Nikon up-right microscope . Hypotonic purification of mitochondria from ~5 x 107 uninduced and tet-induced PF cmyc-Tb927 . 1 . 1730 , cmyc-Tb927 . 10 . 1730 , and cmyc-Tb927 . 10 . 7910 cells was carried out as described above . The lysis buffer was prepared either with 40 U of RNaseOUT ( Invitrogen ) or 200\u03bcg/ml of RNase A from bovine pancreas ( Sigma ) . Anti c-myc agarose conjugated beads ( Sigma ) were washed five times with 1ml ice-cold PBS at 4\u00b0C and subsequently washed once with 1ml of ice-cold immunoprecipitation wash buffer ( Tris-HCL , pH 8 . 0 , 10mM , NaCl 100mM , NP-40 0 . 1% , 1X complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor ( Roch ) and 1% PBS ) . After the last wash , 50 \u03bcl of beads were re-suspended for each reaction in 1 ml of ice-cold wash buffer and incubated for 1 hour at 4\u00b0C on a tube rotator . After adding the mitochondrial lysate to the beads , mixture was rotated for 2 hours at 4\u00b0C followed by centrifugation at 500rpm for 1 min at 4\u00b0C . After removing the supernatant ( unbound proteins ) , the beads were washed four times with 1ml of immunoprecipitation wash buffer and then resuspended in SDS-PAGE loading dye . Aliquots of lysate , bound and unbound fractions were loaded on 10% SDS-PAGE gel . Proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane and probed with polyclonal antibodies against MRB 8170 and TbRGG2 ( a generous gift from Laurie Read , state University of New York at Buffalo , USA ) . Although the stoichiometric ratio among proteins that are involved in one complex is expected to be linear , this relationship can be more complicated for those participating in several complexes ( As an example , see the fractionation patterns for proteins related to the RNA editing process presented in the validation section ) . For stringent analysis of data , we used a previously developed mutual information-based approach , termed context likelihood of relatedness ( CLR ) [34] , to infer pairwise interactions among the proteins based on the observed fractionation patterns . In contrast to association measures such as Pearson correlation coefficient , mutual information is a measure of association that does not have strong prior assumption about the association type [35] . After calculating fractionation pattern similarity scores for each possible interaction using mutual information , CLR determines significant pairwise interactions by comparing the similarity score of each protein pair to a background joint distribution , which was obtained by the calculation of similarities for all possible interactions that each of the interacting proteins can be involved in . To construct the co-fractionation networks , we set the false discovery rate cut-off threshold at 0 . 05 . False discovery rates were calculated using the provided functions in the CLR package [34] . However , since mutual information does not discriminate the type of association ( positive or negative ) , we considered only those interactions as valid that their fractionation patterns were non-negatively correlated with each other as judged by Pearson correlation coefficient . Comparison of results for the mutual information-based version of CLR with the correlation-based version of this algorithm as well as conventional Pearson correlation coefficient-based method indicated that the former is more consistent with the previous knowledge on T . brucei protein complexes . To assess whether the observed co-fractionation patterns for low abundant proteins is significant or unreliable , we generated 100 noisy datasets from each fractionation experiments . Expecting a uniform distribution of noises in the dataset , added noise to each cell in a dataset were modeled by Poisson distribution with the lambda equal to the value of the cell plus the noise term of [the lowest identified ion intensity in the dataset]/[No . of fractions in the dataset] . Those protein pairs that were significantly co-fractionated ( FDR \u22640 . 05 ) in the original dataset , but lost their significant co-fractionation ( p-value >0 . 05 ) in at least 10% of noisy datasets were discarded from the corresponding co-fractionation network . Modulation score examines the density of connections among a pre-specified group of nodes ( e . g . , proteins ) in a given-network with the interaction density that is expected to occur by chance [36] . The density of interactions for a group of nodes is defined as the number of within-group interactions divided by the total number of interactions of the members of the group . This ratio is then compared to the density distribution generated over random groups with the same number of nodes in the network . In the original implementation of the modulation score , the density distribution was estimated by normal distribution assumption [36]; however , the distribution may not necessarily be normal . Therefore , we developed a modified version of the algorithm that uses a kernel smoothing function to estimate the distribution . To find high-confidence interactions , we considered following available orthogonal resources that contain protein-protein interaction data: To estimate the precision ( percentage of interactions that are true ) and recall ( the fraction of overall true interactions that are present in the networks ) of the constructed networks , benefiting from our extensive literature search , we created a gold standard set of >200 proteins in 20 distinct protein complexes ( S3 Table ) , allowing us to evaluate our network against current literature . It should be noted that some of these complexes are partially identified and there might be some subunits that are still uncharacterized . We also ignored putative subunits that were suggested solely based on a single experiment like pull down without further experimental characterizations and/or verifications . The interactions between proteins in the same complex were defined as the positive set . Negative set were defined as interactions between proteins of different complexes . For more stringent analysis , we added to the negative set the other interactions that the subunits of the 20 complexes had with the rest of proteins in the network , unless they had external experimental evidences ( e . g . , pull down ) . Clearly , the defined negative set can contain some of genuine interactions that were not identified previously , leading to an underestimation of the calculated precision for the networks . Precision was defined as the number of interactions in a network that are in the positive set , divided by the total number of interactions in the network that belong to either positive or negative sets . For each network , two types of recalls were defined: 1 ) Recall for proteins: defined as the number of distinct subunits of the twenty complexes that are present in the network divided by the total number of known subunits identified in our mass spectrometry experiments; 2 ) Recall for the interactions: defined as the total number of interactions that the identified subunits of the same complex have in the network divided by the maximum number of interactions that they can have theoretically . Since in a network , the subunits of the same complex are often much sparser than the theoretically assumed fully-connected model , the calculated recalls for the interactions are usually small [10 , 13] . All networks were visualized using Cytoscape , a network visualization tool for Genome Space workflows [39] . NetworkAnalyzer , a plugin of Cytoscape , was used for the topological analysis of networks , including: node-degree distribution , shortest path-length distribution , and topological coefficient distribution [40] . To examine the gene ontology-biological process similarity of interacting genes in the constructed networks , we used Resnik\u2019s approach to quantify semantic similarity between gene ontology terms [41] . Semantic similarities between GO categories of biological processes and cellular compartments were calculated for each interacting protein pair present in a network , if both proteins were annotated in the uniprot database [42] . When calculating semantic similarities , we ignored those terms with evidence codes of NR ( Not recorded ) , ND ( No biological data available ) , and IEA ( Inferred from Electronic Annotation ) . The GO-BP sematic similarities were calculated by GOssTO tool using default parameters [43] . MATLAB R2014b software ( The MathWorks Inc . , Natick , MA ) was used for the CLR score false discovery rate estimation and kernel-based p-value estimation . C# programing language was used for the calculation of the KEGG pathways modulation scores as well as construction of random networks . Other statistical analysis was performed using the R programing language . The mass spectrometry data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium ( http://proteomecentral . proteomexchange . org ) via the PRIDE partner repository [44] with the dataset identifier PXD002640 . Full instrument settings , search parameters , pipeline processing details , and dataset statistics can be found in the PRIDE submission . \n Biochemical fractionation techniques have been widely applied to trypanosomatid organisms to test the possibility of physical associations among a set of pre-specified proteins . Fractionation approaches allow dissection of protein complexes based on different biochemical properties . In the glycerol gradient ( GG ) fractionation approach , protein complexes become separated according to their shape/density . Alternatively , complexes were fractionated on the basis of their overall charge in ion exchange high performance liquid chromatography ( IEX ) experiments . As summarized in Fig 1A , by coupling GG and IEX deep fractionation techniques with semi-quantitative , ultra-sensitive , mass spectrometry , we generalized the approach to chart a proteome-scale T . brucei interaction network . We were able to observe the fractionation pattern of 3354 protein groups ( paralogous proteins with nearly identical sequences were grouped together ) across total of 133 separate fractions from whole cell-GG ( 48 fractions ) , mitochondrial-GG ( 46 fractions ) , cytosolic-IEX ( 19 fractions ) , and mitochondrial-IEX ( 20 fractions ) experiments on T . brucei procyclic form cells ( Fig 2A ) . Due to complementary design of experiments , we were able to observe the fractionation patterns of 1398 ( 42% of total ) proteins in both GG and IEX fractionation approaches , providing a global picture of protein complexes present in T . brucei procyclic cells ( Fig 2B ) . Comparison of our results from mitochondrial experiments with a previously reported repository of mitochondrial proteins [25] revealed that 79% of the detected proteins in our experiments were independently supported to be present in the mitochondria . Comparing the mitochondrial signal probability of the proteins identified in our mitochondrial samples with the above mentioned list and also a list of transcripts that are expressed in procyclic life stage of T . brucei [45] suggested that the identified proteins were significantly enriched ( comparing to proteins identified in [25]; p-value < 1 . 4E-08 , Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney rank sum test ) for the mitochondrial proteins ( Fig 2C ) . The same analysis on the proteins identified in the cytosolic experiment demonstrated a significant depletion ( comparing to total procyclic transcripts; p-value <1 . 4E-07 , Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney rank sum test ) of mitochondrial proteins in the sample . These results demonstrate the accuracy of the employed compartment enrichment procedures . In total , proteins identified in our fractionation experiments cover 43% of all expressed protein coding genes in T . brucei procyclic stage [45] and 77\u2013127% of number of proteins reported in previous proteome-wide SILAC studies [47\u201349] . To test for bias in the data , we examined the distribution of detected proteins in terms of cellular component and number of putative transmembrane domains . As expected , soluble proteins were preferentially detected by the employed fractionation approaches , while the membrane associated proteins were under-represented ( Fig 2D and S1 Fig ) . The detected proteins did not show bias in terms of protein length ( S1 Fig ) . Moreover , observing the transcriptome responses of the identified proteins in different life stages [50] and over the differentiation process [51 , 52] indicated that they show over-expression trend in the procyclic life stage , but biased towards more abundant transcripts in the cell ( S2 Fig ) . Because paralogous proteins with nearly identical sequences are expected to play similar functions in the cell , we randomly selected one representative protein from each protein group to construct a protein interaction map based on the observed fractionation patterns . The relative abundance of proteins in each fraction were measured based on label-free MS2 ion intensity-based approaches ( Detailed in the method section ) . To decipher physical associations from the data , we reasoned physically interacting proteins would show similar patterns across the biochemical fractions . The employed bioinformatics approach for the inference of co-fractionation networks based on the observed patterns is summarized in Fig 1B . As described below , for stringent analysis of data , physically interacting protein pairs were predicted based on five criteria: 1 ) showing significant similarity in their fractionation patterns; 2 ) being robust to the addition of noise in their observed co-fractionation similarity; 3 ) showing shared-peak in at least one fraction; 4 ) being stably interacting with protein complexes as judge by GG-derived patterns; 5 ) reproducibility of co-fractionation when the same fractionation technique was used . Initially , we constructed four separate co-fractionation networks by application of the context likelihood relatedness ( CLR ) algorithm [34] on each of four datasets , separately . As described in the methods section , the CLR algorithm is an information theoretic-based approach that can predict the association of two random variables ( proteins ) based on their observed values ( fractionation patterns ) . It predicts two proteins as interacting only if the similarity of their patterns is significantly higher than what expected based on the background ( estimated Benjamini-corrected FDR of 5% ) . Low abundance proteins might not have reliable patterns in the dataset and therefore show random similarities to other proteins in their fractionation patterns . To confirm that observed similarity is not due to presence of noise in the dataset , co-fractionation similarities were recalculated after the generation of Poisson noise models from each dataset . In each network , we discarded those interactions that lost their significant similarity due to the addition of noise ( Detailed in the method section ) . To further reduce the possibility of chance co-fractionation , we only kept those interactions for which both interacting proteins had a peak in at least one shared fraction . A protein was deemed to have a peak in a fraction if its ion intensity for that fraction was at least 80% of its second-highest intensity . We observed that filtering the interactions by this more stringent criterion led to an increased reproducibility rate of results and , most likely , the elimination of putative false positive interactions from the networks ( Fig 3A ) . In GG fractionation experiments , early fractions are highly enriched for monomeric proteins in the cell ( e . g . , many enzymes ) or those that are not stably involved in the complexes . Since interacting partners for these groups of proteins cannot be reliably identified by our approach , proteins that had a peak only in the top two fractions of GG experiments were discarded from the networks . Cytosolic-IEX and mitochondrial-IEX networks were significantly depleted for proteins of one another ( p-value < 6E-35 ) , most likely because of the enrichment procedures used for these two experiments . To check the technical reproducibility of the results , we focused on interactions occurring among proteins that were detected in both GG experiments . As illustrated in Fig 3B , we found that more than half of co-sedimented protein pairs ( 940 reproducible interactions ) in one GG experiment were also co-sedimented in the other ( FDR \u22640 . 05 in one experiment and p-value \u22640 . 05 in the other ) . Moreover , comparing the number of common interactions between whole cell-GG and mitochondrial-GG networks with random networks with the same structural characteristics revealed that these two networks are significantly enriched for reproducible interactions ( S3 Fig ) . These results indicated that significantly co-sedimented protein pairs in the whole cell-GG experiment are typically co-sedimented in the mitochondrial-GG experiment and vice versa . To increase the accuracy , we removed the interactions among those proteins that were not consistently co-fractionated with each other in both experiments ( i . e . , despite the detection of proteins in both experiments , they co-fractionated in only one experiment ) . Overall , merging GG networks led to a network composed of 12 , 196 interactions among 1 , 417 proteins . The IEX experiments led to the identification of 1 , 708 interactions among 1 , 261 proteins . The smaller size of IEX network compared to those of GG is because former experiments had smaller number of fractions and , therefore , were less informative on protein complexes compared to GG experiments . We next assessed the agreements between IEX-derived and GG-derived networks . As shown in Fig 3C , comparison of cytosolic-IEX network with whole cell-GG network indicated that interactions have peak in the reproducible region ( median correlation of 0 . 47 and 0 . 83 for cytosolic-IEX and whole cell-GG , respectively ) , but skewed toward the region with negative IEX correlations . Importantly , none of significantly co-eluted protein pairs in cytosolic-IEX experiment had correlations less than 0 . 47 in the whole cell-GG dataset . Comparison of mitochondrial-IEX network with mitochondrial-GG network led to a similar result ( Fig 3D ) ; i . e . , interactions had peak in the reproducible region ( median correlation of 0 . 53 and 0 . 73 in mitochondrial-IEX and mitochondrial-GG datasets , respectively ) . Moreover , comparison with random graphs demonstrated that the IEX-derived and GG-derived networks were significantly enriched for the reproducible interactions ( S4 Fig ) . Due to separation of protein complexes in IEX and GG experiments based on different biochemical properties , the confounding complexes in one approach have lower chance to co-fractionate in the other approach as well . However , the observed discrepancies in co-fractionation patterns are not only because of confounding elements , but rather reflect the differences in the nature of the two fractionation experiments as well . As an illustration , we observed that members of translation initiation complex co-sedimented in the whole cell-GG network with the median correlation of 0 . 85 . However , their median correlation in the cytosolic-IEX experiments reduced to 0 . 53 . Likewise , comparison of the co-fractionation patterns among a set of proteins enriched for RNA-dependent interactions demonstrated their strong co-sedimentation in the GG experiments , but separation in the IEX experiment ( S5 Fig ) . This discrepancy can be due to the use of salt gradient in the latter experiment and disruption of the less stable ionic interaction complexes . However , these effects were minimal on complexes that are known to form more stable complexes such as ribosome , proteasome , F0F1 ATPase , and core editosome ( discussed more on the validation part ) . These results suggested that our GG fractionation experiments better preserved the less stable interactions ( i . e . ionic-based interactions ) , but our IEX experiments favored more stable interactions . For the follow-up analysis , we merged the GG and IEX networks together . This global physical map , named TbCF net ( T . brucei co-fractionation network ) , was constructed by distinguishing two types of interactions ( S2 Table ) : 1 ) Those protein pairs that were reproducibly co-fractionated in both GG and IEX networks ( FDR \u22640 . 05 in one experiment and p-value \u22640 . 05 in the other ) ; and 2 ) Those protein pairs that were co-fractionated only in one experiment . The TbCF net connects 2 , 151 proteins with 13 , 865 interactions . The orthogonal reproducible part of TbCF network , termed TbCFOR net , was composed of 2 , 601 ( 19% of total ) interactions among 828 ( 38% of total ) proteins . To test the validity of TbCF net , we first examined the topological properties of the constructed network ( Fig 4A ) . In agreement with protein interaction networks of model organisms , TbCF net has scales-free architecture [53]; i . e . , while most proteins interact with a small number of proteins , some of them ( known as hubs ) are highly linked to the other proteins ( Fig 4B ) . Moreover , as shown in Fig 4C , each protein typically can be reached from every other protein by a small traverse in the network ( i . e . , small path length ) , as expected from a network with a small-world property [54] . Additionally , we observed that expect for ribosomal proteins which make a large , densely intra-connected module in the TbCF net , the topological coefficient also decreases with the number of neighbors ( Fig 4D ) , reflecting that the number of common neighbors for hub proteins compared with the other proteins in the network is relatively low . This feature indicates that highly interacting proteins are not sporadically connected to each other . We next assessed different biological features that can be expected from a protein interaction network . To this end , we first examined whether interacting proteins in the network tend to be involved in the same biological process . As shown in Fig 5A and S6 Fig , we observed that higher similarity scores of fractionation patterns consistently led to an increased probability that two proteins are involved in the same biological process , as judged by gene ontology-biological process ( GO-BP ) analysis . Importantly , this analysis suggested the higher precision of TbCFOR net compared to the TbCF net . KEGG pathway [55] analysis also led to similar results , i . e . , the chance of two proteins participating in the same KEGG pathway increases by having a higher similarity score ( S7 Fig ) . Although proteins in the same KEGG pathway do not necessarily interact with each other as they can have functional rather than physical associations , protein complexes are involved in some KEGG pathways such as ribosome and proteasome . Importantly , we found that KEGG pathway interactions that were also supported by the TbCF net had significantly higher ( p-value <3 . 5E-33 , Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney rank sum test ) co-localization scores compared with the other KEGG interactions ( Fig 5B ) , suggesting the physical nature of associations for the captured interactions . In a more stringent analysis , we next investigated whether or not proteins involved in a same KEGG pathway tend to form a significant module in the TbCF net . To this end , we used a score , termed modulation score [36] , that assess the density of connections among a set of pre-specified proteins; e . g . , proteins with a shared KEGG attribute ( See methods for details ) . This analysis revealed that members of 15 KEGG pathways form densely connected modules ( p-value<0 . 05 ) in the TbCF net ( Fig 5C ) . Interestingly , we observed a significant modulation score for many pathways that are well-known to involve protein complexes ( ribosomes , proteasome , RNA transport , oxidative phosphorylation , etc . ) . The same analysis on the TbCFOR net indicated that this network is not biased towards a specific process and most KEGG pathways remain or even become significantly connected in the TbCFOR net . However , as discussed earlier , TbCFOR net were depleted for those pathways that involved less stable and salt sensitive interactions ( Fig 5C ) . We also analyzed the TbCF net in terms of gene expression responses . In model organisms , it has been shown that transcriptional co-regulation of proteins plays a major role in the efficient control of the cell homeostasis in different environments [17] . It has also been shown in T . brucei that functionally-related proteins tend to be co-expressed with each other [56] . Indeed , gene expression analysis indicated that interacting proteins in the TbCF net show significantly high ( p-value < 2 . 2E-16 , Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney rank sum test ) co-expression trends in different life stages and also during the differentiation process ( Fig 5D and S8 Fig ) . Consistent with GO-BP semantic similarity analysis , co-expression analysis also indicated a significantly higher ( p-value < 2E-07 , Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney rank sum test ) co-expression trend for interactions of TbCFOR net compared to those of TbCF net , suggesting a higher precision of the former network . To estimate precision of TbCF net , we focused on twenty complexes that have been identified experimentally in T . brucei , composed of more than 200 proteins ( S3 Table ) . This analysis demonstrated a precision of 34% in TbCF net with a recall of 80% on proteins and 17% on interactions , which is comparable to previous high-throughput studies of protein interactions based on biochemical fractionation [10 , 13] ( see methods for details ) . However , the estimated precision can be an underestimate as in many cases , subunits of the complexes had been partially identified because of application of stringent conditions . Importantly , consistent with the expected higher precision of TbCFOR net as judged by GO-BP and co-expression analysis , the same analysis on TbCFOR net with literature interactions suggested a precision of 59% ( ~2-fold increase in precision ) . As mentioned in the introduction , the integration of different data sources is highly recommended to reduce false positive results from an interactome . However , due to the lack of a global , unbiased protein interaction map for T . brucei , we were not able to utilize the state-of-art machine learning approaches to systematically integrate additional data sources . To experimentally examine the extent to which the precision of TbCF network can be further improved by other orthogonal information , we performed TAP-TAG TEV-elution of RNA editing ligase 1 ( REL1 ) protein . We selected this protein because it is a subunit of a well-studied T . brucei complex , the core editosome . TEV-elution is a low stringency condition in which transient interactors along with many contaminants can co-purify with the tagged protein . TEV-elution of REL1 protein led to the co-purification of 83 proteins as putative interacting partners ( S4 Table ) . We extracted the sub-network from TbCF net that was restricted to the co-purified proteins . Consistent with that , REL1 was directly connected to its known interacting partners , while well separated from other contaminant proteins in the network ( Fig 6A ) . It should be noted that since only a small subset ( i . e . , five proteins ) of previously known interacting partners of REL1 protein were co-purified in the pull down experiment , and the constructed sub-network was restricted to the identified proteins in that experiment , the other previously known interacting proteins that were also connected to REL1 in TbCF net are not represented in the sub-network , indicating the importance of queried proteins on obtaining a comprehensive sub-network . To further assess the TbCF net , we considered six separate pull down experiments of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase ( aaRS ) proteins in different T . brucei life stages [57] . In these pull down experiments , 262 proteins were co-purified as candidate proteins involved in T . brucei tRNA-synthesis with a minimum overall mass spectral count of two . Following the same procedure as that used for REL1 , the sub-network of these proteins suggested the existence of several distinct complexes among the proteins co-purified with aaRS proteins ( Fig 6B ) . Interestingly , one of these complexes was highly enriched for proteins involved in tRNA-synthesis including the recently identified members of MARS complex [57] and two additional hypothetical proteins . Therefore , the TbCF net was able to successfully distinguish contaminant proteins from direct interactors in both cases . Integration of various TAP-TAG experiments with the TbCF net also suggested that the chance of retrieving a high false positive rate with a targeted search , i . e . , a list of putatively interacting proteins , is very low . In our next attempt , we considered the functional protein interaction network of T . brucei deposited in the STRING database [58] . In the STRING database , most of available functional association data for T . brucei is inferred based on the indirect approaches ( such as text mining and co-expression ) rather than direct experimental evidence ( S9 Fig ) . We extracted the STRING network using a medium confidence level threshold ( the default threshold set by STRING ) for the proteins present in the TbCF net . The retained STRING network was densely connected with 19 , 119 interactions among 1 , 402 proteins ( S10 Fig ) . Next , we derived a secondary network composed of the interactions that were supported by both STRING and TbCF net , termed TbCFSTRING net . The TbCFSTRING net was composed of 2 , 413 interactions among 449 proteins ( that included 13% of interactions and 32% of proteins in the primary STRING network , S10 Fig ) . To assess the validity of the network , the TbCFSTRING net was clustered using the clusterOne algorithm [59] . As shown in Fig 6C ( and presented in more details in S1 File ) , many previously known protein complexes were recovered by this approach , indicating the high accuracy of the TbCFSTRING net . This result indicated that integration of our co-fractionation network with other independent sources ( like AP and STRING in this case ) leads to the elimination of false positive interactions from both sources . Based on the findings in the previous step , we partitioned the interactions in the TbCF net into two parts; those with high confidence , TbCFHC , and those with no external evidence , TbCFNE . As schematically shown in Fig 1A , the high confidence group was composed of interactions that were supported by at least one of the orthogonal resources including KEGG pathways , the STRING database , interlog-mapping , extensive literature searches , and orthogonal reproducibility ( see methods for details ) . As discussed earlier , interaction data in each of these orthogonal resources ( e . g . KEGG , STRING , AP , etc . ) suffers from false positives and also , for some sources , does not imply physical interaction among protein pairs . However , we expected to observe elimination of the false positive interactions by integration of these data with our fractionation-derived network . TbCFHC network was composed of 4 , 726 interactions among 866 proteins ( S2 Table ) , encompassing 34% of the total interactions in TbCF net ( Table 1 ) . Analysis of TbCFHC net indicated its improvement over TbCF net in terms of GO-BP ( S12 Fig; p-value <2E-08 , Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney rank sum test ) , GO-CC ( S12 Fig; p-value <6E-07 , Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney rank sum test ) , and co-expression ( S12 Fig; p-value <5E-117 , Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney rank sum test ) . As judged by the analysis of the same twenty protein complexes discussed above , the estimated precision for TbCFHC net was 80% and 68% without and with the exclusion of literature-derived data from the network , respectively . The estimated precisions for both TbCFOR and TbCFHC networks suggest that integration of TbCF net with other orthogonal resources leads to the overall false discovery rate of less than 40% . Clustering TbCFHC net using ClusterOne algorithm [59] led to the prediction of 128 protein complexes among 716 proteins ( S5 Table ) . The predicted complexes varied in size between three and 70 with the median size of four proteins per complex that is similar to reports from other organisms [10] . Many of the predicted complexes were significantly enriched for subunits of previously known T . brucei complexes . For example , as illustrated in S13 Fig , we were able to successfully identify complexes related to cytoplasmic and mitochondrial ribosomes , proteasome , T-Complex , intraflagellar transport , translation initiation , and mitochondrial RNA editing . To further assess the quality of predicted complexes , we associated them with the available large-scale RNAi screening data for T . brucei [60] . Because each protein complex act as a functional unit in the cell , it is expected that the essential proteins to be over- or under-represented in a protein complex , depending on the function of the complex [61] . Indeed , enrichment analysis of predicted complexes indicated over representation of complexes with enriched or depleted fraction of essential proteins , while complexes with random distribution of essential proteins were under represented ( Fig 7A ) . The predicted essential complexes recapitulated the previous findings for T . brucei . As an illustration , the results indicated that the cytoplasmic ribosomal complex ( Complex 1 ) , proteasome ( Complex 3 ) , and T-complex ( Complexes 10 and 11 ) are essential in all life stages of the parasite ( Fig 7B ) . Conversely , the complex 7 which is highly enriched for intraflagellar proteins ( Fig 7B ) , was not essential in the procyclic life stage of T . brucei [62] . Additionally , complexes related to the mitochondrial ribosome ( Complex 2 and 8 ) were depleted for the essential proteins in the bloodstream life stages ( Fig 7B ) . Clustering of TbCFHC net also led to the prediction of complex membership for 188 protein groups currently annotated as hypothetical , 350 protein groups with the annotated name as putative , and 635 protein groups lacked experimental GO-BP annotation ( evidence codes of EXP , IDA , IPI , IMP , IGI , and IEP according to TriTrypDB v5 ) . To experimentally verify the quality of predictions , we focused on the overlapping complexes that were highly enriched for proteins involved in the Kinetoplastid RNA editing process . Mitochondrial gene regulation is a highly interesting , yet not fully understood , process in T . brucei . In this process , mitochondrial genes are transcribed as polycistronic units . After cleavage , mitochondrial transcripts ( mtRNAs ) become stabilized by the addition of short tails at their 3' ends [63] . Intriguingly , most of the produced mtRNAs originally do not possess correct open reading frames ( ORFs ) and require to be edited before the translation . In the editing process , small RNAs , known as guide RNAs ( gRNAs ) , dictate the insertion , and less frequently deletion , of a defined number of uridine nucleotides at pre-specified positions in mtRNAs [64] . The edited mtRNAs become marked for the translation by the addition of long A/U tails [65] . This highly complicated and intertwined process provides the parasite multiple post-transcriptional regulatory layers over mtRNAs . Mitochondrial post-transcriptional gene regulation is essential for the survival of the parasite in both bloodstream and procyclic life stages , although the precise role of this process is not well understood in the bloodstream form [66 , 67] . Experimental evidence confirms differential regulation of some mtRNAs in at least editing step during the parasite\u2019s life cycle [68 , 69] . For example , while the Cytochrome b ( Cyb; a subunit of complex III ) and cytochrome oxidase subunit II ( COII ) transcripts are preferentially edited in procyclic form , some subunits of complex I such as NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit 8 ( ND8 ) and NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit 7 ( ND7 ) are mostly edited in the bloodstream stage . This developmental regulation in RNA editing is coordinated with the activities of the trypanosome mitochondria during its life cycle to allow the adaptation and survival of the organism in changing environmental conditions [70] . Consistent with the developmental regulation of the RNA editing process , comparative sedimentation analysis of the RNA editing machinery demonstrated that the complexes associated with the RNA editing machinery of bloodstream and procyclic forms are not identical [71] . The TbCFHC net suggested the physical association of 49 protein groups ( 50 proteins ) with the RNA editing machinery of T . brucei in the procyclic life stage ( S6 Table ) . Many of these proteins are well-known to be involved in the RNA editing process . For example , among the 50 predicted proteins , 17 are known to be involved in the core editosome complex [72] , while 21 function in the MRB1 complex [73] . For detailed analysis of their interactions , we distinguished predicted interactions originated from IEX experiments to those of GG experiment . This analysis indicated that members of core editosome and some of the accessory elements were reproducibly co-fractionated in both approaches ( S15 Fig ) . However , about 70% of significantly co-sedimenting protein pairs in the GG experiments were not significantly co-eluted in the IEX experiments ( S15 Fig ) . Visual inspection of the fractionation patterns of these 50 proteins confirmed that they mainly co-sedimented together in mitochondrial-GG experiment , but dissociated into different protein clusters in the mitochondrial-IEX experiment ( Fig 7C ) . It should be pointed out that many proteins that are functionally associated with the RNA editing machinery , mediate their functions through binding to the RNA and GG and IEX mitochondrial fractionation experiments were not RNase treated . However , technical differences between the IEX and GG experiments provided a high resolution picture of the distinct complexes involved in the mitochondrial post-transcriptional regulation of T . brucei . For example , while members of core editosome were reproducibly co-fractionated in both approaches , comparison of IEX and GG data suggested existence of at least three distinct groups of proteins among the accessory elements . These three groups were co-sedimented with each other and with core editosome in the mitochondrial-GG experiment . However , they failed to co-fractionate in the mitochondrial-IEX experiment possibly due to the increased salt concentration , suggesting RNA-dependent or less stable nature of interactions between these groups . Consistent with previous reports [73] , observed fractionation patterns supported a direct interaction between Tb927 . 8 . 8170 and Tb927 . 11 . 16860 , while suggested RNA-dependent interaction of Tb927 . 2 . 6070 with MRB core proteins ( i . e . , Tb927 . 5 . 3010 , Tb927 . 10 . 11870 , and Tb927 . 10 . 10130 ) . However , comparison with previous findings on the interactome of proteins related to the RNA editing machinery suggested that the lack of co-elution in the IEX data could be also because of less stable direct protein-protein interactions . For example , although MRB8170 ( Tb927 . 8 . 8170 ) and TbRGG2 ( Tb927 . 10 . 10830 ) did not co-eluted in the IEX experiment , they were reported to directly interact in Y2H assays [73 , 74] , or AP-based studies [75] . Importantly , a previous study has demonstrated the TEV co-elution of the two proteins in a RNA-enhanced manner [76] . Hence , the lack of co-elution in the IEX fractionation experiment for MRB8170 and TbRGG2 proteins is likely due to less stable interaction of the two proteins . Moreover , fractionation data indicated that members of KPAP1 polyadenylation complex reproducibly fractionated differently from those of core editosome , and suggested their association with mitochondrial ribosome , which is consistent with their functional role that couple the mitochondrial editing with the translation process [65] . Also , the fractionation patterns successfully captured interactions of KPAP1 protein ( Tb927 . 11 . 7960 ) with both editing and ribosomal complexes ( Fig 7C ) , recapitulating the results obtained by mass spectrometric and immunochemical experiments [65] . The TbCFHC net also suggested that six new proteins ( Tb927 . 1 . 3010 , Tb927 . 10 . 7910 , Tb927 . 1 . 1730 , Tb927 . 10 . 5830 , Tb927 . 6 . 1200 , and Tb927 . 10 . 1730 ) play a role in the mitochondrial post-transcriptional gene regulation . Fractionation patterns of GG experiment for these candidates indicated their co-sedimentation with core editosome and accessory elements , but separation from subunits of KPAP1 polyadenylation complex . Importantly , IEX fractionation patterns suggested that two of these candidates ( Tb927 . 6 . 1200 and Tb927 . 10 . 1730 ) strikingly co-fractionated with members of the core-editosome and some accessory elements , but the co-elution of the other four proteins were , in varying degrees , sensitive to the presence of salt with Tb927 . 10 . 7910 being the most salt sensitive one . Examining the localization pattern for three of our candidate proteins ( Tb927 . 10 . 7910 , Tb927 . 10 . 1730 , and Tb927 . 1 . 1730 ) clearly confirmed their exclusive presence in the mitochondria of the parasite ( S16 Fig ) . We also performed immunoprecipitation experiments on tagged versions of these three proteins . These experiments verified their interactions with TbRGG2 and MRB8170 proteins . Consistent with the observed IEX fractionation patterns , we found that the interaction of all three candidates with MRB8170 was abolished following the RNase treatment ( Fig 8A ) . Likewise , we found that only Tb927 . 10 . 1730 remains still bound to TbRGG2 after RNase treatment ( Fig 8A ) . Consistent with this work , another study reported four out of our six candidates ( including Tb927 . 1 . 3010 , Tb927 . 1 . 1730 , Tb927 . 6 . 1200 , Tb927 . 10 . 1730 ) form a novel complex involved in the post-transcriptional regulation of mtRNAs , termed polyadenylation mediator complex , confirming the predictions on these four proteins [77] . To further assess the role of the candidate proteins in the RNA editing process , we performed tetracycline ( Tet ) -inducible RNA interference ( RNAi ) knockdown of Tb927 . 10 . 7910 in the procyclic form of T . brucei . RNAi induction for this gene led to growth-defect phenotype , reflecting its essential role in normal growth of the parasite in the procyclic life stage ( Fig 8B ) . Follow up quantitative RT-PCR verified the knockdown of the candidate transcript compared with the control , uninduced cells ( Fig 8C ) . We next quantified the relative changes in mitochondrial-encoded pre-edited , edited , and never-edited transcripts in the RNAi-knock down background . We also considered three precursor RNAs to examine whether this protein play a role in the precursor RNA processing . This experiment indicated that Tb927 . 10 . 7910 affect the RNA editing process as judged by the accumulation or reduction of pre-edited or edited transcripts for different target RNAs ( Fig 8C ) . Interestingly , our results suggested that Tb927 . 10 . 7910 affect the editing process of the Cyb transcript ( i . e . upregulation of pre-edited mRNA and down-regulation of the edited mRNA ) . The knock down of Tb927 . 10 . 7910 also led to the down regulation of RPS12 edited transcript , and also accumulation of MURF2 pre-edited as well as COIII and A6 edited mtRNAs , suggesting the multiple functionality of Tb927 . 10 . 7910 in the mitochondrial post transcriptional regulatory network of T . brucei . Consistently , a previous study has suggested the essentiality of Tb927 . 10 . 7910 protein in the bloodstream life stage of the parasite [60] . We have presented a systematic study of protein complexes in T . brucei using two complementary biochemical fractionation approaches . Our results led to the assignment of many previously uncharacterized proteins to complexes . The quality of predictions was verified by independent follow up experiments on newly characterized proteins associated with RNA editing machinery . Interestingly , we found that at least five out of six predictions of TbCFHC net are truly associated with the RNA editing machinery , and also that one of them preferentially affect the editing process of Cyb transcript , a developmentally regulated mitochondrial mRNA . Further experiments are required to clarify the roles of these proteins in the mitochondrial gene regulatory network of T . brucei . Despite the employment of stringent filtration criteria , our preliminary network ( TbCF net ) contains false positive interactions ( estimated precision of 34% ) that arose from limitations of the employed fractionation approaches . However , integration of results from two different fractionation approaches led to significant boosting of the precision ( ~2-fold ) , reflecting the importance of data integration for accurate predictions . Due to the lack of an unbiased , high-confidence , and large-enough protein complex map for T . brucei , we were not able to apply sophisticated machine-learning approaches to increase the precision of TbCF net by incorporating other data sources such as transcriptome . The KEGG interactions imply functional rather than physical associations . The interactions deposited in the STRING database were mostly inferred based on the indirect evidences that support functional associations . The literature-derived network was highly biased towards specific protein complexes and also contaminated with non-specific interactors . According to the primary literature-derived network , for example , there were ~360 co-purified protein groups with known members of RNA editing machinery . Of these , 242 protein groups were detected in our experiments . However , the TbCF net predicted strikingly similar co-fractionation pattern for only 49 of these protein groups , reflecting the high-contamination rate of literature-derived network . By stringent filtration of data , we focused on the high confidence sub-network of TbCF net ( TbCFHC net ) , composed of interactions whose existences were supported by at least one other independent resource . The TbCFHC net refines and extracts new information from previous data and computational predictions on the interactome of T . brucei . However , this additional step can lead to the loss of information on proteins for which these types of evidences were not available . Therefore , we can expect that the number of high-confidence interactions will increase with the availability of more experimental data on T . brucei protein-protein interactions . Consistent with this , we have found that integration of results from other experiments ( e . g . AP or immunoprecipitation ) with TbCF net ( which is a mixture of high- and low-confidence interactions ) leads to the elimination of false positive results from both sources . Importantly , our analysis suggested that integration of TbCF net with other orthogonal resources leads to the overall false discovery rate of less than 40% . This finding has a great impact since most protein interactions in T . brucei are inferred by applying stringent conditions at the expense of an increased false negative rate , i . e . , losing transient interactions . Our results suggest that this criterion can be relaxed by considering TbCF net as an orthogonal validation resource . Mass spectrometry-based experiments are known to have limitations in the detection of low abundance proteins ( including many regulator proteins ) , as they become masked in the sample by more abundant proteins . This issue was partially addressed in our approach by fractionating cell-extracts before mass spectrometry . Although comparable with previous SILAC experiments , our experiments cover 42% of proteins associated with expressed mRNAs in the procyclic stage [45] . Despite the fact that some of these transcripts can be translationally silent , the fraction of identified proteins is still potentially low . Our fractionation experiments demonstrated that enrichment for specific cellular compartments offers a viable solution to this issue . Hence , a greater depth could be obtained by performing similar experiments for other subcellular compartments of the cell such as the nucleus or mRNA enriched extracts . Moreover , our analysis clearly indicated an under-representation of membrane proteins in the mass spectrometry data that stems from the employed experimental procedure . Recovery of this class of proteins could likely be increased by use of detergents that can solubilize various membrane associated complexes and protein sub-domains .

{"lay_summary": "Since tuberculosis is commonly considered a chronic lung disease , most studies in tuberculosis focus on the lungs while lymph nodes are almost always depicted only as sites of antigen presentation and immune activation . However , lymph nodes are among the most frequently infected sites of Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( Mtb ) aside from the lungs . The effect of Mtb infection and how lymph nodes respond to Mtb infection is currently unknown . To investigate this , we examined the lymph nodes of two macaque species , cynomolgus and rhesus macaques , at different time points after Mtb infection . We found that overall lymph nodes are not effective killers of Mtb; the lymph nodes of rhesus macaques being less effective at killing Mtb than cynomolgus macaques . Mtb infection also resulted in the destruction of the lymph node structure and this was associated with increased bacterial burden . After a short course of anti-TB drug therapy , the reduction in bacterial burden was lower in lymph nodes compared to lung granulomas . Our data show that aside from being sites of antigen presentation and immune activation , lymph nodes are also niches of Mtb growth and persistence .", "article": "Tuberculosis is commonly considered a chronic lung disease , however , extrapulmonary infection can occur in any organ . Even though lymph nodes ( LN ) are among the most common sites of extrapulmonary Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( Mtb ) infection , and thoracic LNs are frequently infected in humans , bacterial dynamics and the effect of Mtb infection in LN structure and function is relatively unstudied . We surveyed thoracic LNs from Mtb-infected cynomolgus and rhesus macaques analyzing PET CT scans , bacterial burden , LN structure and immune function . FDG avidity correlated with the presence of live bacteria in LNs at necropsy . Lymph nodes have different trajectories ( increasing , maintaining , decreasing in PET activity over time ) even within the same animal . Rhesus macaques are more susceptible to Mtb infection than cynomolgus macaques and this is in part due to more extensive LN pathology . Here , we show that Mtb grows to the same level in cynomolgus and rhesus macaque LNs , however , cynomolgus macaques control Mtb at later time points post-infection while rhesus macaques do not . Notably , compared to lung granulomas , LNs are generally poor at killing Mtb , even with drug treatment . Granulomas that form in LNs lack B cell-rich tertiary lymphoid structures , disrupt LN structure by pushing out T cells and B cells , introduce large numbers of macrophages that can serve as niches for Mtb , and destroy normal vasculature . Our data support that LNs are not only sites of antigen presentation and immune activation during infection , but also serve as important sites for persistence of significant numbers of Mtb bacilli . \n Tuberculosis ( TB ) is one of the significant causes of morbidity and mortality in the world . It is estimated that 2 . 3 billion people worldwide are infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( Mtb ) , the causative agent of TB . In 2016 , there were an estimated 10 . 4 million new TB cases and 1 . 6 million deaths [1] . Although the most common site of infection and disease is the lungs , extrapulmonary TB also occurs , and lymph nodes ( LN ) are the most common sites of extrapulmonary Mtb infection [2 , 3] . In humans , it has been classically observed that a tuberculous pulmonary lesion is almost always accompanied by a granulomatous thoracic LN; this is called a Ghon complex [4 , 5] . Moreover , reports of TB-associated cervical lymphadenitis ( scrofula ) span from antiquity to the present [6\u20138] . Historically , it was not known whether scrofula was related to TB [6] , but some individuals with scrofula eventually died from TB-associated disease including TB meningitis and pneumonia , suggesting a relationship between these dissimilar-appearing pathologies [6\u20138] and this has been demonstrated by more modern techniques , including microscopy , culture and nucleic acid amplification tests [9 , 10] . Lymph node infection occurs in people with active and clinically latent TB [11\u201314] but the timing and frequency of LN infection , bacterial load in LNs , and the relationship between LN infection and disease outcome remain uncertain . Most studies on Mtb infection in LNs were in murine models and focused mainly on identifying the mechanisms and regulation of T cell priming in LNs [15\u201318] . However , mice are different from humans in that they only have a single lung-draining mediastinal LN . Moreover , pathologic presentation and course of TB in mice is substantially different than that seen in humans [19] , and there has been little emphasis on identifying the long-term consequences of Mtb infection in these lymphoid tissues . Guinea pigs have been shown to develop rapid and severe lymphadenopathy after Mtb infection with live bacteria and T cell influx demonstrable in LNs as early as 5 days post-infection [20\u201322] . In cattle , LNs are the most common site of M . bovis infection with microscopic lesions visible as early as 7 days post-infection [23\u201325] . In a small study examining the prevalence of lung and LN infections in bovine TB , all cattle had M . bovis-infected LNs while pulmonary infection was much less common ( 1 of 15 cattle ) [26] . However , since tuberculous lung lesions can be small , some authors as cited by Neill et al , believe that without thorough examination these lesions are missed [25] . It is widely believed that LNs get infected with M . bovis first while lung lesions develop later during infection [24 , 25] . Rhesus and cynomolgus macaques have been used as models of human TB , and represent the spectrum of pathology and disease outcome seen in human Mtb infection [27\u201330] . Thoracic LNs are frequently infected in Mtb-infected macaques [27 , 28 , 31] and the first signs of reactivated TB assessed by microscopic histology can occur in thoracic LNs . We previously showed that macaques considered high risk for reactivation after TNF neutralization had a greater proportion of thoracic LN with Mtb growth compared to those that were low risk [32] . Moreover , in studies where immune suppression was induced by anti-CD4 antibodies , reactivation was associated with macaques with greater depletion of CD4 T cells in thoracic LNs [32 , 33] , suggesting immune responses in these organs are important for overall protection . Anti-TNF induced reactivation can also present in thoracic LNs [32] . In BCG or BCG+H56 vaccinated cynomolgus macaques , protection against reactivation was associated with limited LN involvement [34] . Although closely related to cynomolgus macaques , rhesus macaques are more susceptible to TB owing in part to their more extensive LN pathology [35] . Rhesus macaques have increased numbers of Mtb-infected LNs , higher bacterial burden per LN , and greater LN pathology than cynomolgus macaques . Extensive LN disease can lead to enlargement of LNs such that they impinge on the macaque\u2019s airway , occasionally leading to lung lobe collapse . Enlarged and necrotic LNs have also been noted to erode into the airways leading to substantial dissemination [35] . Although it is clear that LNs are commonly infected , we know very little about how Mtb infection influences LN structure and function . Lymph nodes are highly-structured organs where T cells and B cells interact with dendritic cells ( DCs ) in spatially-distinct anatomic regions , and this delicately balanced organization facilitates priming and adaptive immunity [36\u201339] . Other elements in LNs that are required for proper function and are susceptible to disruption by Mtb infection include subcapsular macrophages and fibroblastic reticular cells [40 , 41] , conduit systems that mediate fluid flow and antigen entry into LNs , capillaries , and lymphatic vessels [42\u201344] . Lymphatic endothelial cells have also been shown to promote or restrict Mtb replication depending on their activation status , thus these cells may represent an underappreciated intra-lymph node niche for Mtb [45 , 46] . In addition to priming adaptive immunity , LNs have intrinsic antimicrobial capacities that limit dissemination of pathogens [47\u201349] although it is unknown whether they have this capacity in Mtb infection . Studies on LNs in TB often focus on diagnosis [9 , 50\u201353] or priming of adaptive immunity [16\u201318 , 36 , 54] , and despite more than a century of TB research , there are many aspects of the infection that remain unclear . Basic questions including the dynamics of LN Mtb infection , whether LNs are sites of successful defense against Mtb growth , the proportion of LNs that get infected , and how Mtb infection affects LN structure and function remain unanswered . To address these questions , we performed a comprehensive study of thoracic LNs in Mtb-infected cynomolgus and rhesus macaques to identify how Mtb infection changes LNs . We found that LNs in Mtb-infected macaques increased in PET-CT-measured metabolic activity early during infection , and at necropsy , almost all of the FDG-avid LNs contained viable Mtb or persistent Mtb DNA . We show that Mtb grows to the same level in LNs of both macaque species , however , cynomolgus macaque LNs were better able to control the infection compared to rhesus macaque LNs . In comparison with granulomas in the lung [55] , thoracic LNs had limited abilities to kill Mtb . Granulomas that form in Mtb-infected LNs disrupt LN structures and greater destruction of the LN structure is associated with higher Mtb burden . Our data support that LNs are a niche for persistent infection , and are likely to play a larger role in the pathogenesis of TB than previously appreciated . Moreover , identifying relationships between LNs , bacterial persistence , and disease progression may yield new insights into disease pathogenesis , improve TB treatment and limit reactivation of latent TB . \n Macaques have multiple thoracic LNs [28] that drain different lung regions , and variable numbers among animals . We previously described differences in the extent of LN disease between rhesus and cynomolgus macaques [35] . To address the overall question of LN infection dynamics and differences between species , we first used PET CT imaging to track inflammation in thoracic LNs following Mtb infection . Our PET probe was 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose ( FDG ) , a radiolabeled glucose analog that is taken up by metabolically active cells; we have demonstrated previously that FDG avidity is enhanced in Mtb-affected tissues and is a surrogate for inflammation in granulomas and lungs [34 , 35 , 56\u201359] . In our study , LNs that were FDG avid and detectable by PET follow one of three courses of FDG uptake over the course of the infection: increased , maintained , or decreased FDG avidity ( Fig 1A and 1B ) . In many macaques , one or more thoracic LNs had measurable FDG uptake by 2 weeks post-infection ( examples shown in Fig 1B ) , and different thoracic LNs within an animal followed different trajectories ( ie . increasing , decreasing , maintaining FDG uptake ) such that one animal could have individual LNs with different uptake patterns ( Fig 1B ) . To examine the relationship between FDG positivity and the presence of viable Mtb in a specific LN , we performed PET CT scans on animals 1\u20132 days prior to necropsy and cultured LN homogenates to measure bacterial burden . We found 90 . 65% ( 194 of 214 ) of LNs visible on scan by PET at necropsy contained culturable Mtb at necropsy , while 83 . 33% ( 200 of 240 ) of undetectable LNs ( SUVR = 0 ) were sterile . Of the \u201chot\u201d lymph nodes ( defined as SUVR \u2265 5 [34] ) on the pre-necropsy PET CT scan , 96 . 3% ( 181 of 188 ) of thoracic LNs contained culturable Mtb , while in thoracic LNs that were \u201cwarm\u201d ( detectable but with SUVR< 5 ) , only 50% ( 13 of 26 ) contained culturable Mtb ( Fig 1C ) . There was a modest correlation ( Spearman\u2019s rho = 0 . 4812 , p < 0 . 001 ) between SUVR and live bacterial burden in PET-detectable LNs at necropsy ( S1 Fig ) . These data suggest that mycobacterial involvement in thoracic LNs is a dynamic process and PET CT-detected FDG uptake is associated with bacterial infection in LNs . We previously determined that there is variation in the number of thoracic LNs that become infected with Mtb among macaques and differences in LN pathology and total LN bacterial burden between cynomolgus and rhesus macaques [35] , however , we know little about bacterial dynamics in individual LNs . To address this , we first determined the number of viable Mtb per LN in both macaque species over time . In cynomolgus macaques , CFU peaked at 4\u20136 weeks ( median = 72001 ) post-infection which then greatly decreased by 11\u201314 weeks ( median = 1226 ) and 16\u201329 weeks ( median = 1021 ) post-infection ( Fig 2A ) . Cynomolgus macaques with well-controlled ( clinically latent , [28] ) infection necropsied at 34\u201354 weeks post infection had the lowest median CFU ( 1 CFU per LN ) ( Fig 2A ) . Unlike cynomolgus macaques where CFU per LN decreased over the course of infection , rhesus macaques had relatively stable median CFU per LN ( Fig 2B ) . At both early ( 4\u20136 weeks ) and later ( 16\u201328 weeks ) time points post-infection , there was no significant difference between the two species ( S2A Fig ) . Of note , the 16\u201329 week post-infection group consisted of two animals with active disease ( n = 2; 15 LNs; median = 4901 CFU; green and orange circles ) and six macaques that were controlling infection ( n = 6; 14 LNs; median = 101 CFU ) ( S3A Fig ) . A subanalysis showed that there was no significant difference between the LN CFU of the two cynomolgus macaques with active disease and the rhesus macaques at 16\u201329 weeks post-infection . However , median LN CFU of the six cynomolgus macaques controlling the infection was significantly lower compared to rhesus macaques at this time point ( S3A Fig ) . Moreover , CFU of cynomolgus macaques at 11\u201314 weeks post infection was significantly lower than rhesus macaques , although the actual difference between medians was only 4-fold ( S2A Fig ) . These data suggest that after reaching a peak in CFU , cynomolgus macaques are capable of reducing the bacterial burden in their LNs over the course of infection while rhesus macaques are not . To determine whether there were differences in the total ( both live and dead ) bacterial burden in these LNs , we used a qPCR-based technique amplifying sigF , a single-copy mycobacterial gene , to estimate the mycobacterial chromosomes per LN ( expressed as chromosomal equivalents [CEQ] ) [55] . Chromosomal DNA ( CEQ ) was first shown to persist in mice lungs after killing Mtb with isoniazid treatment [60] . We previously assessed CEQ in macaque lung granulomas and demonstrated that CEQ persist after bacteria are killed by host responses or by isoniazid [55 , 60] . To confirm this technique worked in LNs , we performed qPCR and bacterial culture on LN samples from isoniazid-treated macaques ( n = 4 ) and found similar CEQ numbers in the drug treated and control groups ( S4A Fig ) . Moreover , similar levels of CEQ were found between CFU+ LNs and sterile LNs with granulomas from drug-treated macaques ( S4B Fig ) . This shows that Mtb DNA persists in LNs even after Mtb is killed by isoniazid treatment . As a negative control and to confirm the specificity of our probes , we used LNs from an uninfected macaque and were unable to detect any Mtb genomes in these samples . We did not find significant differences in CEQ across different time points post-infection in cynomolgus macaques ( Fig 2C ) . However , we saw a reduction in CEQ levels in rhesus macaques at later time points post-infection ( 4 weeks vs 16\u201328 weeks , 23 . 5-fold , p = 0 . 0184; 11\u201314 weeks vs 16\u201328 weeks , 6 . 7-fold , p = 0 . 0278 ) ( Fig 2D ) , which could be because the macaques that have severe disease and have deteriorated clinically are necropsied prior to this time point , and thus the samples are from those with less severe disease . Both species had similar levels of CEQ at 4\u20136 weeks and 11\u201314 weeks post-infection . Rhesus macaques at 16\u201328 weeks post-infection had lower CEQ compared to cynomolgus macaques ( 3 . 2-fold ) ( S2B Fig ) . These data suggest that Mtb replicates and grows to the same extent in LNs of both species and the lower viable Mtb burden in cynomolgus macaque LNs was not due to fewer Mtb in these tissues , but more likely to those LNs being better able to kill Mtb . To estimate the ability of LNs to kill Mtb , we evaluated the ratio of live Mtb burden ( CFU ) and total ( live+dead ) Mtb burden ( CEQ ) per LN [55] , as we previously described in macaque lung granulomas [55] . As validation of this technique in LNs , we estimated the CFU/CEQ killing ratio in sterile LNs ( with evidence of previous infection , i . e . granuloma ) compared to CFU+ LNs with granulomas following isonaized treatment ( S4C Fig ) . As expected , isoniazid treatment reduced the CFU/CEQ ratio ( i . e . increased bacterial killing ) in LNs . Thus , this technique can estimate Mtb killing in lymph nodes in the setting of drug treatment . Cynomolgus macaque LNs showed little to no killing at 4 weeks post infection , but their ability to kill Mtb increased ~9-fold by 11\u201314 weeks post infection ( Fig 2E ) . There was no significant difference in the killing capacity of LNs between 4 weeks and 16\u201329 weeks post-infection . Lymph nodes in the 16\u201329 weeks group represented macaques with a wide range of disease and the poor killing capacity is largely driven by samples from two monkeys with severe disease at this time point ( n = 2; 12 LNs; median = 0 . 122; green and orange circles vs controlling animals n = 6; 10 LNs; median = 0 . 0076 ) . We found no significant difference between the killing capacity of cynomolgus macaque LNs who had active disease and rhesus macaque LNs at this time point . However , LNs from cynomolgus macaques who were controlling the infection had higher bacterial killing compared to rhesus macaques ( S3B Fig ) . Lymph nodes from cynomolgus macaques with well-controlled infection sampled at 34\u201354 weeks had the highest level of bacterial killing ( 277-fold increase in killing capacity relative to macaques sampled at 4\u20136 weeks post infection ) ( Fig 2E ) . While the Mtb killing capacity of LNs from cynomolgus macaques who are controlling the infection improves over time , rhesus macaque LNs demonstrated little to no Mtb killing at any time point examined ( Fig 2F ) . Cynomolgus macaque thoracic LNs were 13-fold ( p < 0 . 0001 ) better at killing Mtb than rhesus macaque LNs at 11\u201314 weeks post-infection ( S2C Fig ) , suggesting that rhesus macaque LN\u2019s reduced ability to kill Mtb may contribute to the more severe LN disease in rhesus macaques during Mtb infection [35] . Not all thoracic LNs in an individual macaque become infected with Mtb ( Fig 3A , S5 Fig ) . A significant proportion of thoracic LNs in individual macaques were CFU- ( cynomolgus: 50\u201381% , rhesus: 26\u201340% , depending on time of necropsy ) as supported by our PET CT data ( Fig 1C ) . Although most CEQ+ LNs were also CFU+ ( Fig 3B , pink bars ) , there were also CEQ+ LNs that were CFU- ( Fig 3B , purple bars ) , suggesting that these LNs were able to completely sterilize the infection . Alternatively , it is possible that such LNs never have contained viable Mtb but we detected \u2018free-floating\u2019 Mtb genomes that were trapped by the LN; our limit of detection is 1000 CEQ per whole LN , so free floating DNA would have to be at reasonably high levels . These CFU-CEQ+ ( purple bars ) LNs were more prevalent in cynomolgus than rhesus macaques ( Fig 3B ) . There were also LNs without detectable Mtb genomes but contained culturable Mtb ( CEQ-CFU+ ) ( Fig 3B , yellow bars ) which likely represent samples where the number of Mtb genomes were below the limit of our qPCR assay . Overall , these data indicate that although it is possible for immune responses in LNs to kill Mtb , viable bacteria can remain in LNs for extended periods of time , suggesting these organs represent sites of long-term bacterial persistence . Peripheral LNs , such as axillary and inguinal LNs , do not directly drain the lungs but may offer insight into extrapulmonary dissemination and immunity . To quantify mycobacterial dynamics in these organs , we sampled peripheral LNs for live Mtb and Mtb genomes from all macaques in this study and compared them to thoracic LNs . We found that only 8 . 2% ( 14 of 171 ) of the peripheral LNs we examined yielded Mtb genomes , and only 3 . 5% ( 6 of 171 ) contained viable Mtb , and these were at quite low levels ( Fig 4A ) ; this is not surprising since Mtb infection is generally confined to the thoracic cavity . Extrapulmonary disease , if present , is most frequently found in the liver , and occasionally the spleen , as noted in our previous publications [27 , 28 , 35] . We compared the live and total ( live+dead ) bacterial burden , as well as killing capacity of LNs from ten macaques ( n = 5 cynomolgus , n = 5 rhesus ) that had CEQ from both thoracic and peripheral LNs . Peripheral LNs had significantly lower levels of CFU compared to thoracic LNs ( Fig 4B ) . Because the CFU levels were so low , the majority of the CFU+ LNs were outside the CEQ assay\u2019s limit of detection . Here ( Fig 4 ) , we are only showing CFU , CEQ and CFU/CEQ data from CEQ+ LNs . The number of Mtb genomes recovered from peripheral LNs was significantly lower ( 29-fold , p<0 . 0001 ) compared to thoracic LNs ( Fig 4C ) . Since we found significantly more live Mtb in thoracic LNs and most of the peripheral LNs were sterile ( Fig 4B ) , the killing capacity of peripheral LNs was significantly higher ( 168-fold , p<0 . 0001 ) than thoracic LNs ( Fig 4D ) . Our data suggest that Mtb infection of peripheral LNs can occur but is infrequent , and when it does occur , growth is to lower levels ( CEQ ) and these LNs are more likely to kill Mtb than thoracic LNs . However , trafficking of dead Mtb or Mtb genomes to peripheral LNs could also occur and should not be discounted . Mtb infection leads to granuloma formation in thoracic LNs and these granulomas can be focal or coalescing lesions that grow in size and efface the LN ( Fig 5A and 5B ) . We previously reported that bacilli from multiple granulomas can seed a single LN [55 , 61] , and this is supported by histologic evidence where multiple independent granulomas are observed in a single LN ( Fig 5B ) . A LN\u2019s function is tightly linked to its physical structure and organization , and granulomas may physically disrupt LN architecture and impair their ability to function ( ie . lymphatic filtration and immune cell trafficking to , from and within the LN ) . We performed immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) on cynomolgus macaque thoracic LNs with or without granulomas to investigate how granulomas influence the localization of cells , blood vessels , and the conduit systems that are important for normal LN function ( Fig 6 ) . We selected lymphocyte markers CD3 ( T cells ) and CD20 ( B cells ) . Myeloid cell markers in lymph nodes are complex because dendritic cells ( DCs ) and epithelioid macrophages express both CD11c and DC-SIGN but can be distinguished by their different sizes and morphologies , while macrophages also express CD68 and can express CD163 . For structural studies , we used markers defining vessels and conduit systems in LNs including LYVE-1 for lymphatic vessels , PNAd for high endothelial vessels ( HEV ) , and collagen 1 ( col1 ) for conduit systems . We focused on LNs from cynomolgus macaques to capture LNs from the full range of infection outcomes . Uninfected thoracic LN organization is consistent with typical LN architecture with CD3+ T cells and CD11c+ DCs being abundandant in paracortical regions , CD20+ B cell-rich germinal centers at the periphery , and CD68+ and CD163+ macrophages present in the subcapsular space and medullary region ( Fig 6A ) . Mesh-like LYVE-1+ lymphatic vessels were present in the central LN region while PNAd+ HEV are distributed throughout the paracortex , and col1+ conduits regularly-spaced through the T cell regions . Mtb-infected thoracic LNs can contain multiple focal non-necrotizing granulomas or large coalescing granulomas that disrupt the LN architecture . We found that even small granulomas ( Fig 6B ) had large clusters of CD11c+CD68+ macrophages that appeared to push T cells out of these regions and impinged on germinal centers , but also disrupted nearby HEV and lymphatic vessels . Moreover , granulomas and adjacent areas had disorganized col1 staining instead of the uniformly-distributed staining associated with the nomal conduit network found in uninvolved areas . Large granulomas caused extensive remodeling of LN structure . Effaced LNs ( Fig 6C ) had coalescing necrotic granulomas with poorly-circumscribed margins and large numbers of CD11c+CD68+ macrophages , and these granulomas displaced T cell- and DC-rich zones in the LN paracortex , destroyed B cell-rich germinal centers , and eliminated the normal vascular elements in their vicinity . The granulomas in these LNs stained positively for col1 , but as with less involved LNs , the staining is disorganized and lacks cohesive conduit-like organization . Interestingly , LN granulomas lack several features that are present in lung granulomas . Although these granulomas are present in B cell and T cell-rich organs , they appear to lack granuloma-adjacent B cell-rich tertiary lymphoid structures [62 , 63] , and distinct lymphocyte cuff regions . These observations suggest LN granulomas have large populations of potential host cells , but have structural differences that may impair the ability to control bacterial replication . Moreover , the process of granuloma formation in thoracic LNs can destroy important aspects of LN structure that contribute to T cell and B cell priming and may affect overall anti-mycobacterial immunity . We hypothesized that effaced LNs ( i . e . extensive necrosis ) would be an excellent site for Mtb growth so we used auramine-rhodamine ( A-R ) staining to identify where bacteria localize in LNs . We found that Mtb , visualized as numerous small puncta in A-R stained sections ( Fig 7A , A-R inset ) , were abundant in granulomatous regions but absent from granuloma-free regions suggesting granulomas are foci of bacterial persistence and replications in LNs . When LNs with different levels of effacement were compared for CFU and CEQ , LNs with >50% effacement had significantly higher CFU and CEQ than those with \u226450% effacement ( Fig 7B and 7C ) but there was no difference in the killing capacity of LNs with differing degrees of effacement ( Fig 7D ) . The increase in both CEQ and CFU , and lack of killing , suggests that the macrophage populations and necrotic regions associated with effacement are conducive to Mtb persistence and replication . Cytokine producing cells play important roles in the control of Mtb infection [64] . Although LNs are sites of T cell priming for control of infection in lung granulomas , they also must generate functional cells to control infection within the LNs . We evaluated cytokine expression using multiparameter flow cytometry in thoracic LN cells from 24 cynomolgus macaques ( S2 Table ) included as controls in other studies . We investigated T cell , B cell , and macrophage expression of proinflammatory cytokines: Th1 ( IFN\u03b3 , IL-2 , TNF ) , Th17 ( IL-17 ) and anti-inflamtory cytokine IL-10 following stimulation with peptide pools from Mtb antigens ESAT-6 and CFP-10 . LNs with granulomas ( identified either by gross pathology or histopathology ) were evaluated for this analysis . Uninfected LNs ( no granuloma established and no live Mtb ) had similar cytokine profile as that of LNs with granuloma that cleared Mtb , however uninfected LNs had significantly higher proportions of CD3 T cells ( p = 0 . 0009 ) than LNs with granulomas . The number of LNs for each analysis varied by the panel used in that particular study ( S3 Table ) . First , we compared cytokine reponses between thoracic LNs with granuloma that had live Mtb ( CFU+ ) and those that cleared Mtb ( CFU- ) . As seen in lung granulomas [65] , we found that LN granulomas represent a multi-cytokine environment with the presence of both pro and anti inflammatory cytokines produced by a variety of cells within a LN . Cytokine responses largely overlapped between CFU+ LNs and CFU- LNs ( S3 Table ) . Nevertheless , CFU- LNs with granulomas had significantly higher proportions of CD11b+ cells producing IL-10 ( Fig 8A ) when compared with CFU+ LNs with granulomas , while CD4+ T cells producing TNF ( Fig 8B ) were significantly higher in CFU+ LNs ( S3 Table Panel A ) . With the exception of TNF response , there was no significant difference in cytokine producing T , B and CD11b+ cells in CFU+ and CFU- LNs ( S3 Table Panel A ) in response to Mtb antigens ESAT-6 and CFP-10 . Secondly , we questioned whether there was an association between cytokine response and bacterial burden . We found a significant negative correlation between bacterial burden and CD11b+ cells producing IL-10 ( Spearman\u2019s \u03c1 -0 . 5046 , p = 0 . 0389 ) ( S3 Table Panel C ) , and a positive correlation with bacterial burden and CD4 T cells producing TNF ( Spearman\u2019s \u03c1 0 . 2892 , p = 0 . 0462 ) ( S3 Table Panel C ) . These data suggest that IL-10 response from macrophages is associated with bacterial clearance while CD4+ T cell TNF response could be attributed to onging Mtb replication . Next , we investigated whether Mtb burden alters the overall capacity of cells in thoracic LNs with granuloma to produce cytokines by stimulating them non-specifically with PDBu and ionomycin . Overall , sterile ( CFU- ) LNs have a trend towards cells producing higher frequency of cytokines compared to CFU+ LNs . Of note , LNs with granulomas that are sterile had significantly higher frequencies of CD3+ T cells producing IFN\u03b3 ( Fig 8C ) ; CD8+ cytotoxic T cells producing IFN\u03b3 , IL-2 or TNF ( Fig 8D ) and CD20+ B cells producing IL-2 ( Fig 8E ) than CFU+ LNs . In addition , we also observed a higher proportion of CD11b+ cells producing IFN\u03b3 and IL-10 ( S3 Table Panel B ) in LNs without bacterial burden under the same conditions , even though PDBu-ionomycin does not induce these cytokine production in CD11b+cells . These data suggest that LNs that have sterilized the infection have a higher capacity to produce both pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines and this may have contributed to its ability to eliminate Mtb . We extended our investigation to understand whether there are differences in Mtb-specific responses between thoracic and peripheral LNs to determine whether these responses could contribute to protection in the periphery . For this analysis , 14 peripheral LNs and 27 thoracic LNs from 7 animals were evaluated ( S4 Table ) . None of the peripheral LNs had any granuloma or grew Mtb from culture , while 14 of thoracic LNs had granulomas and 12 thoracic LNs grew Mtb . Peripheral LNs had significantly higher proportion of CD3+ ( S6A Fig ) and CD4+ T cells ( S6B Fig ) than thoracic LNs ( S4 Table ) . Irrespective of bacterial burden or granuloma presence , the proliferative capacity of T cells , as measured by Ki67+ CD3+ T cells , especially Ki67+ CD8+ cytotoxic T cells ( S4 Table , S6C Fig ) , was significantly higher in thoracic LNs than in peripheral LNs , suggesting that Mtb induced proliferation might occur in the thoracic LNs . There was no difference in T cell cytokine response or the capacity to induce cytokines by T cells as determined by PDBu and ionomycin stimulation between thoracic and peripheral LNs ( S4 Table ) . Finally , since we observed that the thoracic LNs with higher bacterial burden had decreased capacity to produce certain cytokines when compared to those with no bacterial burden , we examined whether the degree of LN effacement altered immune cell function in a subset of thoracic LNs where data for degree of effacement ( n = 55 ) were available . There was no difference in cytokine responses to Mtb specific antigens , capacity to produce cytokines in LNs without granulomas , \u226450% effaced LNs , and >50% effaced LNs ( S5 Table ) suggesting that LN effacement does not alter the functional capacity of LN cells . Since thoracic LNs are generally poor at killing Mtb , we examined whether there was a relationship between LN involvement and extrapulmonary disease . Greater lymph node involvement , as assessed by gross pathology scoring ( which accounts for number of LNs with granulomas , size of LN , and effacement ) was associated with more extrapulmonary disease in rhesus ( F test , R2 = 0 . 588 , p < 0 . 0001 ) but not in cynomolgus macaques ( S7A Fig ) . Extrapulmonary score was not related to total LN bacterial burden in either macaque species ( S7B Fig ) . We also examined data from a previous study [57] to determine whether Mtb in thoracic LNs was less effectively killed during a short-course ( 2 months ) linezolid ( LZD ) treatment relative to lung granulomas . Lung granulomas had a higher proportion of sterility ( 75% LZD-treated vs . 21 . 8% control ) after drug treatment compared to thoracic LNs ( 16 . 7% LZD-treated vs . 2 . 5% control ) . The reduction in bacterial burden in LNs ( S8A Fig ) was lower than the reduction of bacterial burden in lung granulomas ( S8B Fig ) of LZD-treated macaques ( 55-fold vs . 181-fold , respectively ) compared to untreated control macaques . These data suggest that after 2 months of LZD treatment , Mtb was killed less effectively in thoracic LNs compared to lung granulomas , supporting that LNs are bacterial reservoirs and potential sites of reactivation or relapse . This is consistent with our previously published observation in which short course isoniazid and rifampin treatment for 2 months was more effective in reducing bacterial burden in lung granulomas than in thoracic LN during active disease treatment [66] . \n Traditionally , lung infection has been the primary focus of TB research and treatment , despite evidence that Mtb also infects and persists in LNs . There are unanswered questions regarding the importance of LN infection in the pathogenesis of TB including bacterial replication or killing , and the antimicrobial immune responses in LNs . Here we focused on LN infection in cynomolgus and rhesus macaques , two closely-related nonhuman primate species that replicate the pathology of human TB [27\u201329] . We present data supporting that LNs can become inflamed ( FDG-avid ) as early as 2 weeks post infection . Starting at 4 weeks post-infection , FDG activity correlated with the presence of live bacteria in LNs at necropsy . Although thoracic LNs in cynomolgus macaques initiate killing of Mtb by 11 weeks post-infection , with substantially more killing at later time points , LNs from rhesus macaques have impaired killing capacity , likely contributing to the increased susceptibility of this species . We also found that granulomas substantially disrupt the structure of LNs , and can completely efface the organ , which is associated with increased growth of Mtb . Overall , our data support that thoracic LNs are a site of prolonged bacterial persistence , sometimes at quite high levels . Previous work has demonstrated that LNs are important in reactivation TB [11 , 32\u201334] but little is known about the interplay of Mtb infection and host responses in LNs . Large human studies by Poulsen in the 1930s and 1940s showed that early after Mtb infection , there was often an initial fever that lasted 2\u20133 weeks [67 , 68] . These subjects presented with enlarged \u201chilar shadows\u201d by x-ray , assumed to be lymphadenopathy . A large number of subjects also presented with hilar adenitis when they first became tuberculin skin test positive which they ascertained to be ~40 days after infection . To investigate the dynamics of Mtb infection in LNs of macaques , we used PET CT to monitor LNs over the course of infection . In support of Poulsen\u2019s early data , we found increased metabolic activity ( FDG uptake ) in thoracic LNs as early as 2 weeks post-infection and more LNs became FDG-avid by 4\u20136 weeks . This increase in FDG uptake is associated with Mtb infection in that nearly all FDG+ LNS are also CFU+ at necropsy , and is likely due to increased metabolic activity of cells during priming of the adaptive immune response as well as the host cells reacting to the presence of Mtb bacilli . However , not all LNs in an individual macaque became infected , and those that were infected could wax and wane in FDG avidity over the course of infection . Rhesus and cynomolgus macaques are closely related species used in TB research , and we recently performed quantitative analyses of similarities and differences between Mtb infection outcomes in these species [35] . Cynomolgus macaques develop the full range of infection outcomes seen in humans , from clinically latent to severe active TB . In contrast , rhesus macaques are more susceptible , with nearly all animals developing active and often severe TB within several months of experimental low dose infection . One striking feature of TB in rhesus macaques is the often substantial involvement of thoracic LNs with high levels of necrosis; in some cases a LN can grow massively and impinge on the airways causing lobe collapse or erode into a bronchus leading to further dissemination . Certainly , substantial LN involvement can be seen in some cynomolgus macaques , but in general the extent of LN disease is lower in this species [35] . A limitation of comparing these models is that due to the susceptible nature of rhesus macaques , essentially none of these animals present with long term controlled ( latent ) infection following low dose challenge with virulent Mtb and nearly all succumb before 24 weeks of infection . Thus , LN samples from long term ( >26 weeks post-infection ) rhesus macaques for comparison with similar time points in cynomolgus macaques are not available . Here , we show that Mtb grows to the same initial level ( with a wide range ) in thoracic LNs at 4 weeks post infection in both species , but rhesus lymph nodes were less successful at killing Mtb over time . Remarkably , at 16\u201329 weeks post-infection , the different disease states ( controlling to active disease ) of cynomolgus macaques were reflected in the capacities of their LNs to kill Mtb . This further supports our findings that the lungs and LNs are intricately linked during Mtb infection [35] . However , in general , LNs were less bactericidal than lung granulomas in both species [55] . This deficit in bacterial killing at the LN level in part explains the pronounced LN disease and increased susceptibility of rhesus macaques to Mtb infection [35] . Despite the limitation of CEQ as being simply an estimate of Mtb genomes , it is the only technology at this time that is available to estimate live + dead bacilli and actual killing of Mtb ( together with CFU measurement ) in vivo . Lung granulomas peak in bacterial burden early in infection with approximately 104\u2212105 CFU per granuloma , followed by substantial killing of bacteria in most granulomas once the adaptive immune response is initiated [55] . In contrast , some thoracic LNs had 100-fold more bacteria than lung granulomas . In cynomolgus macaques , we show that even when granulomas are established , some LNs are able to clear Mtb and these LNs are associated with higher CD11b+ cells producing IL-10 . LN bacterial burden was inversely correlated with CD11b+ cells producing the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 and sterile LNs had significantly higher capacity to produce both pro- and anti- inflammatory cytokines , suggesting this multi-cytokine environment might contribute to bacterial containment in a subset of LNs , similar to our observations in lung TB granulomas [65] . We did not have sufficient samples to conduct a full kinetic analysis of the CD11b+IL-10+ population; this finding requires further study to understand its significance . Somewhat surprisingly , we discovered Mtb genomes in peripheral LNs ( i . e . , axillary and inguinal ) that do not drain the lungs , even though most of these LNs were sterile . Although our data suggest that occasionally peripheral LNs can be infected with small numbers of bacteria and are better at killing Mtb than thoracic LNs , we cannot exclude the possibility that genomes detected here were free-floating DNA trapped in these tissues . Histologic analysis did not reveal evidence of pathology in the CEQ+ peripheral LNs , even in the few that had viable Mtb . The difference in the cytokine responses and proliferative markers we observed between peripheral and thoracic LNs could be attributed to constant stimuli from Mtb at the thoracic LNs . The improved sterilizing capacity of peripheral LNs could also be due to the timing of infection in these LNs , which we could not ascertain in our study . The structure and spatial organization of cells in LNs are critical for their function [69 , 70] , and may also help explain why LNs have limited abilities to kill Mtb . Even though the killing capacity and immune function of LNs with varying degrees of effacement are similar , the bacterial burden ( CEQ and CFU ) in >50% effaced LNs was 16-fold higher compared to \u226450% effaced LNs . Our data support that the more extensive the disruption in LN structure is , the more conducive the LN is for Mtb growth and this is likely due to a number of factors . First , the formation of a granuloma recruits a large number of macrophages that can serve as niches for Mtb growth . Moreover , as LN granulomas expand they push out T cells , disrupt B cell follicles , which could interfere in antibody production that could aid in controlling infection [71 , 72] , and damage LN-associated vasculature , which could potentially change drug availability . This disruption of LN architecture may also affect resident innate immune cells that have been shown to be spatially pre-positioned to provide a cascade of cytokines which promote macrophage antimicrobial resistance limiting pathogen dissemination [47] . In contrast to lung granulomas [62 , 73 , 74] , LN granulomas do not have a well-defined lymphocytic cuff with tertiary lymphoid structures surrounding the epithelioid macrophage region . As the presence of these structures in lung granulomas has been associated with protection in pulmonary TB [63 , 75 , 76] , we speculate that the absence of these structures results in poorly functional granulomas that have limited capacity to restrain or kill Mtb . These observations suggest that granulomas can potently influence aspects of LN architecture that facilitate T cell priming and systemic immunity , while providing an abundance of extra- and intracellular sites for mycobacterial replication . Early autopsy studies support the idea that LNs serve as long-term reservoirs for Mtb . Viable Mtb bacilli were found in 9 . 4\u201327% of LNs from autopsies of patients without evidence of TB disease in lungs or anywhere in their bodies [77\u201379] . Mtb infection of LNs may also have implications in drug treatment . In our study , we found that a short-course LZD therapy was less effective in killing Mtb in LNs compared to Mtb in lung granulomas and this was also observed in short course isoniazid with rifampin [66] . Indeed , in a study that followed 113 patients that relapsed for 30 months , tuberculous lymphadenitis was found as a risk factor for relapse [80] . Of the 12 patients that had both pulmonary and LN TB , 9 ( 75% ) patients had a recurrence exclusively in the LNs , while the remaining 3 patients had recurrence in both lungs and LNs [80] . However , only 1 patient was confirmed by bacterial culture and lymphadenopathy could also be caused by an impaired regulation of the immune system . In HIV+ patients with clinically latent TB , the presence of abnormal FDG uptake in mediastinal LNs was associated with patients showing subclinical TB disease and the likelihood of developing symptomatic TB disease during the 6 month follow up [11] . These studies suggest that Mtb can persist in LNs even after drug treatment , which we observed as well , and increased FDG activity in these tissues are associated with persisting or reactivating TB disease . This study presents an in-depth investigation into bacterial dynamics and immunity in thoracic LNs during Mtb infection . Our data indicate that LNs can contain large numbers of bacteria and serve as long-term reservoirs of bacterial persistence . Thus , understanding how non-protective LN granulomas differ from protective lung granulomas may lead to strategies that improve TB treatment and outcomes . Moreover , our study identifies LNs and LN infection as important considerations for measuring vaccine and treatment efficacy . \n Cynomolgus ( Macaca fascicularis ) ( n = 32 ) and rhesus macaques ( Macaca mulatta ) ( n = 19 ) that served as controls ( no vaccine or drug treatment ) for other studies from 2011 to 2016 were selected for this study . These macaques were infected with a low dose ( ~1\u201328 CFU , median = 6 CFU ) of Mtb strain Erdman using a bronchoscope . The animals used in this study are summarized in Table 1 . The number of LNs examined per monkey ranged from 4\u201321 , with the median being 12 per monkey . A detailed list of animals can be found in Supplementary Table 1; other data from some monkeys have been previously published in other studies as noted in that table . All procedures and protocols were approved by the University of Pittsburgh\u2019s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee . All experimental manipulations , protocols , and care of the animals were approved by the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee ( IACUC ) . The protocol assurance number for our IACUC is A3187-01 . Our specific protocol approval numbers for this project are: 13122856 , 15066174 , 12080653 , 15126588 , 11110045 , 12060181 , 14023305 , 1105870 , 11090030 , 15015299 , 12090832 , 15066174 , 1003622 , 1105870 . The IACUC adheres to national guidelines established in the Animal Welfare Act ( 7 U . S . C . Sections 2131\u20132159 ) and the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals ( 8th Edition ) as mandated by the U . S . Public Health Service Policy . All macaques used in this study were housed at the University of Pittsburgh in rooms with autonomously controlled temperature , humidity , and lighting . Animals were singly housed in caging at least 2 square meters apart that allowed visual and tactile contact with neighboring conspecifics . The macaques were fed twice daily with biscuits formulated for nonhuman primates , supplemented at least 4 days/week with large pieces of fresh fruits or vegetables . Animals had access to water ad libitem . Because our macaques were singly housed due to the infectious nature of these studies , an enhanced enrichment plan was designed and overseen by our nonhuman primate enrichment specialist . This plan has three components . First , species-specific behaviors are encouraged . All animals have access to toys and other manipulata , some of which will be filled with food treats ( e . g . frozen fruit , peanut butter , etc . ) . These are rotated on a regular basis . Puzzle feeders foraging boards , and cardboard tubes containing small food items also are placed in the cage to stimulate foraging behaviors . Adjustable mirrors accessible to the animals stimulate interaction between animals . Second , routine interaction between humans and macaques are encouraged . These interactions occur daily and consist mainly of small food objects offered as enrichment and adhere to established safety protocols . Animal caretakers are encouraged to interact with the animals ( by talking or with facial expressions ) while performing tasks in the housing area . Routine procedures ( e . g . feeding , cage cleaning , etc ) are done on a strict schedule to allow the animals to acclimate to a routine daily schedule . Third , all macaques are provided with a variety of visual and auditory stimulation . Housing areas contain either radios or TV/video equipment that play cartoons or other formats designed for children for at least 3 hours each day . The videos and radios are rotated between animal rooms so that the same enrichment is not played repetitively for the same group of animals . All animals are checked at least twice daily to assess appetite , attitude , activity level , hydration status , etc . Following M . tuberculosis infection , the animals are monitored closely for evidence of disease ( e . g . , anorexia , weight loss , tachypnea , dyspnea , coughing ) . Physical exams , including weights , are performed on a regular basis . Animals are sedated prior to all veterinary procedures ( e . g . blood draws , etc . ) using ketamine or other approved drugs . Regular PET/CT imaging is conducted on most of our macaques following infection and has proved very useful for monitoring disease progression . Our veterinary technicians monitor animals especially closely for any signs of pain or distress . If any are noted , appropriate supportive care ( e . g . dietary supplementation , rehydration ) and clinical treatments ( analgesics ) are given . Any animal considered to have advanced disease or intractable pain or distress from any cause is sedated with ketamine and then humanely euthanatized using sodium pentobarbital . Serial 2-deoxy-2-[18F]-D-deoxyglucose ( FDG ) positron emission tomography ( PET ) with computed tomography ( CT ) imaging was performed in a biosafety level 3 facility as described previously [56] . Lymph nodes were identified by our analyst ( P . Maiello ) and metabolic activity ( FDG avidity ) was measured [81] . Lymph nodes that were seen on scan had a maximum SUV ( standard uptake value ) greater than or equal to 2 . 3 SUVR ( maximum standard uptake value ratio normalized to muscle to reduce variability between scans ) . Despite the fact that we can see LNs with SUV \u2265 2 . 3 on the scans , we consider LNs with SUVR of \u2265 5 to be \u201chot . \u201d Serial scans were performed ranging from 1 week to 54 weeks post-infection . The majority of the shorter term infection macaques ( necropsied 14 weeks post-infection or earlier ) were scanned every 2 weeks until necropsy . The longer term infection macaques ( necropsied 15 weeks post-infection or longer ) were scanned every 2 weeks until 8 weeks post-infection and every 4 weeks thereafter . Some of the latent monkeys ( 34\u201354 weeks ) were only scanned immediately prior to necropsy . Necropsy procedures were as previously described [31] . Briefly , one to three days prior to necropsy , macaques were imaged by FDG-PET/CT to ascertain which LNs were metabolically active and to measure their FDG avidity . Individual lung granulomas , thoracic , axillary and inguinal LNs were excised and cut into 2 sections . One section was homogenized into single cell suspension in PBS for immunology and aliquots made for both plating on 7H11 agar plates to obtain colony forming units ( CFU ) and DNA extraction for qPCR . The other section was placed in 10% normal buffered formalin and paraffin embedded for histologic examination . Bacterial burden ( CFU ) per LN was determined by accounting for the amount of sample plated compared to the entire LN sample . The LN necropsy score was determined based on the number of LNs with granulomas , the size of the lymph nodes and the degree of LN effacement . The extrapulmonary score was determined based on the presence , relative frequency and size of granulomas in other areas of the body ( eg . diaphragm , liver , spleen , other abdominal viscera ) and the number of extrapulmonary sites ( excluding lymph nodes ) that had bacterial burden . Our necropsy scoring system is available in [35] . Intracellular cytokine staining was performed on a random sampling of LNs with and without granuloma from each animal ( n = ~4/animal ) . A total of 168 LNs ( with and without granuloma ) from 24 cynomolgus macaques that were part of other studies in our lab were included in this analysis and processed as previously described [65] . Single cell suspension of 96 LNs were stimulated with peptide pools of Mtb specific antigens ESAT-6 and CFP-10 ( 10 \u03bcg/ml of every peptide ) in the presence of Brefeldin A ( Golgiplug: BD biosciences ) for 3 . 5 hours at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2 [65] . Positive control ( n = 72 LNs ) included stimulation with phorbol dibutyrate ( PDBu ) and ionomycin [31] . An unstimulated control was included whenever additional cells were available . The cells were then stained for viability ( Invitrogen ) , surface and intracellular cytokine markers according to standardized protocols . Flow cytometry panel for cell surface markers for T cells included CD3 ( clone SP34-2; BD Pharmingen ) , CD4 ( Clone L200 , BD Horizon ) and CD8 ( clone SK1: BD biosciences ) . In addition , the B cell marker CD20 ( clone 2H7; eBioscience ) and myeloid cell marker CD11b ( clone Mac-1 , BD Pharmingen ) were included as additional markers in certain samples . Intracellular cytokine staining panel included pro-inflammatory cytokines: Th1 [IFN-\u03b3 ( clone B27 ) , IL-2 ( clone: MQ1-17H12 ) , TNF ( clone: MAB11 ) ] , Th17 [IL-17 ( clone eBio64CAP17 ) ] and the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 ( clone JES3-9D7 ) markers . In addition , T cell proliferation marker Ki67 [clone B56] was included in the panel for a subset of samples . Data acquisition was performed using an LSR II ( BD ) and analyzed using FlowJo Software v . 9 . 7 ( Treestar Inc , Ashland , OR ) . A detailed list of macaques included in the analysis can be found in S2 Table . Histological examination was performed by an experienced veterinary pathologist ( E . Klein ) as previously described [31] . Tissue samples were cut ( 4-6mm ) and stained with hematoxylin and eosin . Characteristics of granulomas , such as , size , type ( caseous , non-necrotizing , suppurative , or mixed ) , distribution pattern ( focal , multifocal , coalescing , focally extensive and locally invasive ) , and cellular composition were noted . Immunohistochemistry was performed as previously indicated [73 , 82] on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded ( FFPE ) LNs obtained at necropsy . Briefly , sections were deparaffinized and antigen retrieval was performed using a Retriever ( Electron Microscopy Services , Hatfield , PA ) in Tris-EDTA-Tween-80 buffer 73 . Sections were stained for Tcells/B cells/dendritic cells ( polyclonal rabbit anti-CD3 , Dako , Santa Clara , CA; polyclonal rabbit anti-CD20 , Thermo Fisher Scientific , Pittsburgh , PA; mouse-anti-CD11c , Leica Microsystems , Buffalo Grove , IL ) , macrophage subsets ( mouse anti-CD68 , Thermo Fisher; rabbit anti-DC-SIGN , ProSci Inc , Poway , CA; mouse anti-CD163 , Thermo Fisher ) , LN vascular and structural aspects ( Goat anti-LYVE-1 , R&D Systems , Minneapolis , MN; rat-anti PNAd , BioLegend , San Diego , CA ) , and LN conduit systems ( visualized by staining for rabbit anti-collagen 1 [Abcam , Cambridge , MA] ) . Primary antibodies were visualized with species- and isotype-specific secondary antibodies purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch ( West Grove , PA ) . Auramine rhodamine was performed as previously indicated [73] using reagents from BD Biosciences ( San Jose , CA ) . Images were acquired at 20x magnification with a Nikon e1000 widefield microscope ( Nikon , Melville , NY ) with Nikon Elements . DNA extraction and qPCR was performed with modifications as described previously [55] . Briefly , frozen aliquots were thawed and volumes recorded throughout the extraction process . Samples were transferred to tubes containing 150 \u03bcl of 0 . 1mm zirconia-silica beads ( Biospec Products ) before adding 600\u03bcl of Tris-EDTA buffer , pH 8 . 0 . Three hundred microliters of 70\u00b0C phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol ( 25:24:1 , Sigma-Aldrich ) were subsequently added and the samples incubated at room temperature for 10 minutes . The samples were then vortexed , the aqueous layer separated and supplemented with 50\u03bcl 5M NaCl and a second phenol chloroform extraction performed on the extracted aqueous layer . DNA was precipitated with the addition of one volume of 100% isopropanol and one-tenth volume of 3M sodium acetate and incubating at -20\u00b0C overnight . The DNA pellet was washed with 70% ethanol , dried and resuspended in nuclease-free water . Mtb genomes were then quantified using Taqman Universal Master Mix II ( Life Technologies ) and previously published sigF primer-probe combination [55] . Each sample was amplified in triplicate using an ABI Systems 7900HT machine . Chromosomal equivalents ( CEQ ) were quantified by comparing the samples with a standard curve derived from serial dilution of Mtb genomes prepared from liquid culture . Our detection limit for the standard curve was 10 copies per reaction . When we calculated the number of genomes for the whole lymph node , our detection limit was 1 , 000 copies per lymph node . D\u2019Agostino & Pearson Omnibus normality test was performed on all data described in this manuscript . Since the data were not normally distributed , Nonparametric t-test was used when comparing two groups ( Mann-Whitney test ) . Kruskal-Wallis test was used to compare more than two groups with post hoc analysis Dunn\u2019s multiple test comparisons . P values \u22640 . 05 were considered significant .

{"lay_summary": "Microsporidia are microbial parasites that live inside their host cells and can cause disease in humans and many other animals . The small nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans has recently become a convenient model host for studying microsporidian infections . In this work , we sample Caenorhabditis and other small nematodes and 47 associated microsporidian strains from the wild . We characterize the parasites for their position in the evolutionary tree of microsporidia and for their lifecycle and morphology . We find several new species and genera , especially some that are distantly related to the previously known Nematocida parisii and instead closely related to human pathogens . We find that some of these species have a narrow host range . We studied two species in detail using electron microscopy and uncover a new likely mode of exit from the host cell , by budding off the host cell plasma membrane rather than by fusion of a vesicle to the plasma membrane as in N . parisii . We also find a new species that infects the epidermis and muscles of Caenorhabditis rather than the host intestinal cells and is closely related to human pathogens . Finally , we find that one Nematocida species fails to elicit the same host response that other Nematocida species do . These new microsporidia open up many windows into microsporidia biology and opportunities to investigate host-parasite coevolution in the C . elegans system .", "article": "Microsporidia are fungi-related intracellular pathogens that may infect virtually all animals , but are poorly understood . The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has recently become a model host for studying microsporidia through the identification of its natural microsporidian pathogen Nematocida parisii . However , it was unclear how widespread and diverse microsporidia infections are in C . elegans or other related nematodes in the wild . Here we describe the isolation and culture of 47 nematodes with microsporidian infections . N . parisii is found to be the most common microsporidia infecting C . elegans in the wild . In addition , we further describe and name six new species in the Nematocida genus . Our sampling and phylogenetic analysis further identify two subclades that are genetically distinct from Nematocida , and we name them Enteropsectra and Pancytospora . Interestingly , unlike Nematocida , these two genera belong to the main clade of microsporidia that includes human pathogens . All of these microsporidia are horizontally transmitted and most specifically infect intestinal cells , except Pancytospora epiphaga that replicates mostly in the epidermis of its Caenorhabditis host . At the subcellular level in the infected host cell , spores of the novel genus Enteropsectra show a characteristic apical distribution and exit via budding off of the plasma membrane , instead of exiting via exocytosis as spores of Nematocida . Host specificity is broad for some microsporidia , narrow for others: indeed , some microsporidia can infect Oscheius tipulae but not its sister species Oscheius sp . 3 , and conversely some microsporidia found infecting Oscheius sp . 3 do not infect O . tipulae . We also show that N . ausubeli fails to strongly induce in C . elegans the transcription of genes that are induced by other Nematocida species , suggesting it has evolved mechanisms to prevent induction of this host response . Altogether , these newly isolated species illustrate the diversity and ubiquity of microsporidian infections in nematodes , and provide a rich resource to investigate host-parasite coevolution in tractable nematode hosts . \n Microsporidia are fungi-related obligate intracellular pathogens , with over 1400 described species [1 , 2] . Interest in these organisms started 150 years ago when researchers , especially Louis Pasteur , studied silkworm disease that was caused by a microsporidian species later named Nosema bombycis [3] . In the past decades , microsporidia have attracted more attention when they were revealed to be a cause of diarrhea in immunocompromised patients and were further demonstrated to have a high prevalence in some areas in immunocompetent patients and healthy individuals [4\u20136] . Microsporidia are transmitted between hosts through a spore stage . Inside the microsporidian spore is found a characteristic structure called the polar tube , which at the time of infection can pierce through host cell membranes and introduce the sporoplasm ( the spore cytoplasm and nucleus ) into host cells [1 , 7] . These obligate intracellular pathogens are known to infect a wide range of hosts among protists and animals , especially insects , fish and mammals [1] . Even though nematodes constitute a huge phylum with over 25 , 000 described species , very few studies on microsporidian infections in nematodes have been reported so far [1] . The free-living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has been used as a major biological model species over the last 50 years [8] . However , until the past decade , little was known about its biology and ecology in its natural environment and no natural pathogens were isolated until C . elegans could be readily isolated from natural environments . C . elegans is now known to be found in compost heaps , rotting fruits ( apples , figs , etc . ) and herbaceous stems , as well as with diverse carrier invertebrates ( snails , isopods , etc . ) [9\u201311] . C . elegans coexists with a variety of prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbes , including both its food and pathogens , which likely have a large impact on its physiology and evolution [12\u201315] . With an improved understanding of the natural history of Caenorhabditis [16 , 17] , dramatically increased number of various wild rhabditid nematode strains and species have been isolated and identified . C . elegans' close relatives such as Caenorhabditis briggsae or Caenorhabditis remanei are isolated from similar environments [18] . Oscheius tipulae , a very common bacteriovorous nematode species , also in family Rhabditidae , can be readily isolated from soil and rotting vegetal matter [10 , 19 , 20] , as well as its closest known relative Oscheius sp . 3 , with which it cannot interbreed [21] . Interest in these rhabditid nematodes concerns not only the evolution of genomic and phenotypic characters , but also their inter- and intraspecific interactions and co-evolution with other organisms , especially with various microbes in their natural habitats . While nematodes feed on bacteria and small eukaryotes , some microbes take nematodes as their food source [13 , 14 , 16] . Among them , microsporidia are obligate intracellular parasites and thus are in particularly tight association with their hosts . The microsporidian Nematocida parisii was the first found natural intracellular pathogen of C . elegans , which we isolated from a wild C . elegans sampled near Paris , France [22] . Nematocida sp . 1 ( described here as Nematocida ausubeli ) was further isolated from a wild Caenorhabditis briggsae strain in India [22] . A microsporidian species isolated in C . elegans was found to infect the epidermis and muscles and was named Nematocida displodere [23] . Two microsporidia infecting marine nematodes have also been described , namely Sporanauta perivermis [24] and Nematocenator marisprofundi [25 , 26] . However , the extent and diversity of microsporidia infections in nematodes remained sparsely described . Here we describe a collection of 47 terrestrial nematode strains that we isolated from the wild with a microsporidian infection . The microsporidia can be grown in the laboratory in their host using C . elegans culture conditions and stored frozen with their nematode host . They are all transmitted horizontally . In this set , we found that N . parisii and N . ausubeli ( formerly called N . sp . 1 ) are in association with further host species and display a wider geographical distribution than so far reported [22] . N . parisii is the most common C . elegans-infecting species we found in the wild . We further discovered new nematode-infecting microsporidian species . From our phylogenetic analysis using small subunit ( SSU ) ribosomal DNA and \u03b2-tubulin sequences , five new microsporidia species were placed in the Nematocida genus , while the others defined two new genera in the microsporidian clade often designated as Clade IV , which includes human pathogenic microsporidia such as Enterocytozoon bieneusi and Vittaforma corneae . The similarities and differences in the morphological features of these microsporidia matched their groupings by sequence similarity . We therefore describe two new microsporidian genera , Enteropsectra and Pancytospora . and nine new species in these two genera and Nematocida . We further examined Nematocida ausubeli and Enteropsectra longa by electron microscopy , which allowed us to observe different mechanisms for their exit from host intestinal cells , through a vesicular pathway for N . ausubeli ( as described for N . parisii; [27] ) , but surprisingly through membrane budding for E . longa . Concerning specificity of infection , we find cases of tight specificity between host and pathogen . We also find that N . ausubeli fails to strongly induce the transcription of genes that are induced in C . elegans by N . parisii infection . Overall , our study points to strong and diverse interactions between wild rhabditid nematodes and microsporidia , and provides a platform for further study of these infections . \n Our worldwide sampling of bacteriovorous nematodes was primarily aimed at isolating Caenorhabditis species and , to a lesser degree , Oscheius species . From this sampling , we identified a subset of strains with a pale body color ( Fig 1A ) , some of which , upon morphological examination using Nomarski microscopy [22] , appeared infected with microsporidia . In total , we collected 47 nematode strains ( S1 Table ) displaying putative microsporidian infections , comprising 10 nematode species from different parts of the world ( Tables 1 and 2; Fig 1B ) . The microsporidia strain JUm2807 was isolated during these sampling efforts and described elsewhere as Nematocida displodere , and is not considered here [23] . The unidentified microsporidian strains were characterized by sequencing of PCR fragments of the SSU rDNA and \u03b2-tubulin genes . We were able to amplify 45 SSU rDNA sequences ( most 1390 bp long ) and 32 \u03b2-tubulin sequences ( most 1210 bp long ) ( S1 Table ) . We first blasted the sequences in GenBank for initial grouping , then built phylogenetic trees and calculated interspecific genetic distances , based on our sequences and the sequences of related species from GenBank . We present below the grouping and phylogenetic distribution of new microsporidia strains , starting with those closest to N . parisii . Molecular sequences of microsporidia in ten wild C . elegans strains and four C . briggsae strains showed \u2265 99% SSU rDNA and \u2265 97% \u03b2-tubulin sequence identities to N . parisii sequences in GenBank . In the global phylogenetic analysis of microsporidia , these 14 sequences form a group with previously reported sequences of N . parisii strains ERTm1 , ERTm3 and ERTm5 [26] ( Fig 2 ) . The N . parisii isolates were all found in Europe ( note however that the sampling is highly biased towards Europe , especially France ) , with the exception of the previously reported ERTm5 ( JUm2055 ) , isolated from a C . briggsae strain sampled in Hawaii ( Fig 1B; Table 1A ) [29] . Note that a recent article assigns this strain to a new species based on genome divergence [28] . Eight other microsporidian strains showed \u2265 99% SSU rDNA and \u2265 95% \u03b2-tubulin sequence identities to the corresponding genes of the unnamed Nematocida sp . 1 in GenBank ( Table 1B ) , previously reported in C . briggsae [22 , 30] . This N . sp . 1 group is most closely related to N . parisii in the microsporidian phylogeny and the sequences of both SSU and \u03b2-tubulin genes gave the same grouping ( Figs 2 and 3; S2 Fig; Table 3 ) . Because of these new samples of N . sp . 1 and their phylogenetic difference and genetic distance to the N . parisii group , here we describe N . sp . 1 as Nematocida ausubeli n . sp . ( see Taxonomy section after the Discussion ) . Whereas N . ausubeli was so far only reported from C . briggsae ( India , Cape Verde [30] ) , we also found it in C . elegans and C . remanei , in France , Portugal and Germany ( Table 1B; Fig 1B ) , thus broadening its geographic and host range to several species of the Elegans group of Caenorhabditis from Europe . The remaining 20 microsporidia strains that we identified are distributed among several other species , including some species in another clade ( see below ) . Thus the dominant microsporidia species in our collection of Caenorhabditis and other nematodes are Nematocida parisii and Nematocida ausubeli n . sp . , with 17 and 10 strains , respectively . They were found in several species of the Elegans group of Caenorhabditis nematodes . Of the remaining 19 microsporidian strains , nine had a Nematocida species as their top blast hit in GenBank , with similarity between 81% ~ 86% of SSU rDNA and 74% ~ 84% of \u03b2-tubulin genes . In terms of host and geographical ranges , these microsporidia were found in two C . briggsae strains ( Thailand and Guadeloupe ) , one C . tropicalis strain ( Guadeloupe ) , one C . sp . 42 strain ( NIC1041 from French Guiana ) , three Oscheius tipulae strains ( France , Czech Republic , and Armenia ) , one Rhabditella typhae strain ( Portugal ) and one Procephalobus sp . strain ( JU2895 from Spain ) . In the phylogenetic analysis of SSU rDNA , the corresponding sequences formed a single clade with N . parisii and N . ausubeli , with Ovavesicula popilliae as sister group within Clade II of the microsporidian phylum ( see Fig 2 ) [34] . In addition , the JUm2807 strain that has been recently described as Nematocida displodere [23] is distinct from all of them . From phylogenetic analysis and genetic distance of SSU rDNA genes , these Nematocida strains form four groups . These putative new Nematocida species have a mean genetic distance among them of at least 0 . 06 ( Table 3 ) , while their intra-specific genetic distances are all 0 . 00 ( when several strains were isolated ) . This inter-group distance is also greater than the distance between N . parisii and N . ausubeli . Hence we describe them below as four new species: Nematocida minor , Nematocida major , Nematocida homosporus and Nematocida ciargi n . spp . ( see Taxonomy section ) . In terms of the phylogenetic relationships within the Nematocida genus in the SSU rDNA tree , the first outgroup clade to N . parisii + N . ausubeli was formed by JUm2751 , JUm2747 and JUm2751 , corresponding to N . major ( Fig 2 ) . The second branch out was formed by JUm1510 and JUm2772 , described here as N . minor . N . ciargi JUm2895 was placed in a basal position to the clade formed by N . parisii , N . ausubeli , N . major and N . minor ( Fig 2 ) . At the base of the Nematocida genus , the most externally branching sequences appeared to be those of N . displodere JUm2807 , and of N . homosporus JUm1504 and NICm516 . All topologies were highly supported , except for the node defining the latter clade of N . homosporus and N . displodere ( Fig 2 ) . In the phylogenetic tree based on both genes ( SSU rDNA and \u03b2-tubulin ) , N . ciargi was placed at the base of Nematocida genus , while N . displodere and N . homosporus still formed one clade ( Fig 3 ) . The phylogenetic tree only based on \u03b2-tubulin sequences supported the grouping of strains and overall their relative positions ( S2 Fig ) , except that the relative placement of N . displodere and N . ciargi was exchanged . The \u03b2-tubulin phylogeny has one more branch formed by NICm1041 , numbered provisionally N . sp . 7 , for which we failed to amplify the SSU rDNA fragment . Whole-genome analysis could be performed in the future to refine these placements . The Nematocida consensus phylogeny is shown in Fig 3 next to the phylogenetic relationships of the nematode hosts in which they were naturally found ( see below for further specificity tests ) . Although the numbers of samples and species are too low for rigorous testing , the data are at least consistent with the intestinal microsporidia species branching through continuous co-evolution with their nematode host . For example , all intestinal Nematocida species found in Caenorhabditis species form one clade , with a first outgroup including Oscheius and Rhabditella pathogens and a distant outgroup infecting the distant outgroup Procephalobus ( Fig 3 ) . The exception is N . displodere that was found a single time , in C . elegans , and corresponds to a change in tissue tropism . As with previously isolated Nematocida , the newly identified microsporidia appeared to be transmitted horizontally , because a bleaching treatment [35] of infected gravid adults eliminated the infection in the culture and reinfection could be obtained by exposure to spores in the environment . All Nematocida microsporidia stages described here were found exclusively in the intestinal cells and were not detected in the germ line . As previously described for N . parisii [22] , two main stages could be distinguished by Nomarski optics . First , the meront stage appeared as areas of infected intestinal cells devoid of storage granules . These areas were first small circular regions , then extending to longer grooves . Second , rod-shaped sporoblasts and spores appeared in the intestinal cell cytoplasm . In host cells that were heavily infected with N . parisii and some other species , groups of spores inside vesicles could be seen [22] , possibly derived from spore re-endocytosis [36] . In this study , as described before [22] , all N . parisii and N . ausubeli infections displayed two distinct classes of spore size ( Table 1; Fig 4A and 4B; S3A Fig ) . N . major and N . minor also displayed two spore size classes . N . major formed slightly longer but thinner spores than N . parisii . N . minor showed however much smaller spores , for each class taken separately ( Tables 2 and 4; Fig 4C and 4D ) . In contrast , N . homosporus and N . ciargi only have a single class of spore size , with N . homosporus spores having an intermediate size ( 2 . 00 \u00b1 0 . 22 \u03bcm long , 0 . 72 \u00b1 0 . 12 \u03bcm wide ) and N . ciargi spores having a smaller size ( 1 . 39 \u00b1 0 . 20 \u03bcm long , 0 . 59 \u00b1 0 . 13 \u03bcm wide ) . Spore vesicles were observed more frequently with N . homosporus or N . ciargi infections than with other Nematocida infections ( Fig 4E and 4F ) . N . ausubeli being the most commonly found parasite of C . elegans besides N . parisii , we further chose to study its lifecycle by electron microscopy . The ultrastructure by electron microscopy and the deduced lifecycle of N . ausubeli overall resembled those of N . parisii , with possible differences outlined below . High-pressure freezing/freezesubstitution allowed better to visualize lipid membranes compared to room temperature preparation methods . We observed meronts , which are separated from the host cell by a single membrane bilayer , likely pathogen-derived ( Fig 5A and 5B; S1A and S1B Fig ) . Their cytoplasm appeared packed with ribosomes . Some meronts displayed an elongated shape and contained several nuclei ( Fig 5B and 5L ) . The membrane enclosing the meronts appeared to darken progressively and intracellular membrane compartments developed , likely corresponding to the progressive transition to a sporont stage ( Fig 5C ) . We further observed sporogony , whereby individual sporoblasts with a single nucleus are formed , each surrounded by a membrane ( Fig 5D and 5E; S1A and S1D Fig ) . We did not observe any nuclear division at this stage ( unlike in Enteropsectra longa , where they were easily found; see below ) . We observed progressive stages of sporogenesis , including formation of the anchoring disk , polaroplast membranes , polar tube , posterior vacuole and spore coat ( Fig 5E\u20135G; S1C , S1D , S1F and S1G Fig ) . In the final stages of sporogenesis and in mature spores that corresponded to the small size class observed in light microscopy , two polar tube coil cross-sections could usually be observed ( Fig 5H and 5J; S1L Fig ) . A single large spore could be found , which displayed three polar tube coil sections on either side of the spore ( six sections in total; Fig 5K ) . Thus , the tube coiled several times in large spores , instead of once in the small spores . In N . parisii , five polar tube sections were reported on one side of the large spores [22]; it is thus possible that large spores of N . ausubeli harbor fewer polar tube coils than those of N . parisii ( because a single large spore was found in each species , it is however difficult to conclude ) . The anchoring disk defines the anterior pole of the spore . Below the anchoring disk , the polar tube is lined on either side by polaroplast membranes ( visible in Fig 5F and 5G ) . A polar tube cross-section with several layers could be seen in Fig 5J and the posterior turn of the polar tube in S1I Fig . The mature spore was seen to contain a posterior vacuole on the side opposite to the anchoring disk ( Fig 5K; S1H\u2013S1J Fig ) . This vacuole seemed to develop from a dense membrane compartment of the sporoblast ( S1C and S1D Fig ) . The spores displayed an external coat with several layers ( Figs 5H , 5J , 5K and 6A; S1I\u2013S1L Fig ) . The spores in the host cytoplasm appeared either isolated , or clustered within a large vesicle . Some isolated spores were surrounded by an additional membrane outside the spore coat and the inner face of this membrane appeared coated ( Fig 5H ) . Unlike in N . parisii [27] , we could not see the additional membrane around all spores . Fig 6A shows a spore apparently exiting the host cell through exocytosis ( although we cannot rule out that such images correspond to endocytotic events ) . Spores in the lumen were not surrounded by any additional membrane ( Figs 5K , 5L and 6A ) . When spores were clustered in a vesicle , two membranes could be observed around them ( Fig 5J , and other instances ) . Whereas the Nematocida genus is in Clade II of the microsporidia [22 , 34] , the remaining nine microsporidia strains in our collection were placed in Clade IV , which , unlike Clade II , contains several human-infecting microsporidia ( Fig 2 ) . This clade assignment was based on SSU rDNA sequences , which had closest ( 88\u201389% ) identities to the insect parasite Orthosomella operophterae ( host: moth Operophtera brumata ) ( Table 2 ) . Only four \u03b2-tubulin sequences could be obtained , and these were closest ( 75% ~ 76% identity ) to Vittaforma corneae , a human-infecting microsporidia species and a close relative of Orthosomella operophterae ( whose \u03b2-tubulin sequence is not available ) , consistent with rDNA analysis . We thus isolated nematode-infecting microsporidia that are in a distinct evolutionary branch compared to Nematocida and are closer relatives of the human-infecting microsporidia . Eight out of the nine strains in this group have Oscheius species as their nematode host and infect their gut: seven of them from different locations in France were found in O . tipulae , while JUm408 was found in Oscheius sp . 3 [21] from Iceland . The ninth strain , JUm1396 , was isolated from a C . brenneri strain and is the only one in this set to infect non-intestinal tissues . In the phylogenetic analysis , these nine strains separated into two groups , corresponding to the two new genera described below , Enteropsectra and Pancytospora ( see section on Taxonomy ) ( Fig 2; S4 Fig ) . The first group included four strains , JUm408 , JUm1456 , JUm2551 and JUm1483 , which were phylogenetically placed as a sister group to Liebermannia species ( with hosts such as grasshoppers ) ( Fig 2 ) . In the \u03b2-tubulin phylogeny , Enteropsectra strains also showed a sister relationship with the group of V . corneae and Enterocytozoon bieneusi , a human intestinal parasite ( S2 Fig ) . However , with \u03b2-tubulin , JUm408 and JUm1483 formed a branch , JUm1456 and JUm2551 another branch , which was different from their SSU rDNA phylogenetic position . Based on molecular sequences , spore morphology and host specificity ( below ) , we describe two species in the Enteropsectra genus , E . longa ( type strain JUm408 ) and E . breve ( type strain JUm2551 ) , and do not assign the two other strains to a species . E . longa and E . breve strains have a small mean SSU genetic distance of 0 . 005 ( Table 3 ) but differ in spore size and host specificity ( see below ) . While E . longa and E . breve form a sister group to Liebermannia species on the SSU rDNA phylogeny , they have a smaller mean genetic distance to O . operophterae ( 0 . 08 ) than to Liebermannia ( 0 . 11 ) . The second new clade of nematode-infecting microsporidia includes the five remaining strains and showed strong support as sister lineage to the clade formed by Enteropsectra and Liebermannia species , with O . operophterae as outgroup ( Fig 2 ) . Based on molecular sequences , host and tissue specificity , we describe two new species: Pancytospora philotis ( JUm1505 as type strain , JUm1505 , JUm1670 , JUm2552 ) , found in the Oscheius gut , and P . epiphaga ( JUm1396 ) from a C . brenneri strain from Colombia that caused an epidermis and muscle infection ( Fig 7; S5 Fig ) . As with Nematocida , all of the infections by Clade IV microsporidian strains mentioned above appeared to be transmitted horizontally , as bleaching of the nematode culture eliminated the infection . The Enteropsectra strains and P . philotis were only observed to infect the intestine of Oscheius nematodes . By contrast , P . epiphaga ( JUm1396 ) was found to infect epidermis and muscles of C . brenneri ( Fig 7D; S5D , S5E and S5F Fig ) , thus sharing its tissue tropism with N . displodere , although on a different evolutionary branch . P . epiphaga could also infect C . elegans ( N2 reference background ) ( S7F Fig ) and C . briggsae ( AF16 ) . A striking feature of Enteropsectra strains is their cellular localization within the nematode intestinal cells: Enteropsectra were all observed to form their spores on the apical side of the epithelial cell at first , while meront stages could be seen in a more basal position ( Figs 7A , 7B , 7E; 8L ) . This polarization within the host intestinal cell was not observed in infections of P . philotis nor of any Nematocida species ( Table 2; Figs 4 and 7 ) . The Enteropsectra and Pancytospora species displayed quite different sizes and shapes of spores from those of Nematocida species and we did not see any spore-containing vesicles in these microsporidian infections . They all show a single class of spore size . Though apart in the phylogenetic analysis , E . longa ( JUm408 ) and P . philotis share similar dimensions of spores , which are particularly long and thin: E . longa ( JUm408 ) spores measure 3 . 76 \u00b1 0 . 38 \u03bcm by 0 . 49 \u00b1 0 . 06 \u03bcm , while P . philotis spores measure 3 . 46 \u00b1 0 . 48 \u03bcm long by 0 . 42 \u00b1 0 . 06 \u03bcm . These spores are even longer than the largest spores and thinner than the smallest spores in Nematocida . In stark contrast , E . breve ( JUm2551 ) form small rod-shaped and crescent-shaped spores ( Fig 7B; Table 4 ) . Because of the striking difference in spore distribution , we further analyzed by electron microscopy the type species of the Enteropsectra genus , Enteropsectra longa ( JUm408 ) in Oscheius sp . 3 JU408 . The meront stage appeared overall similar to that of Nematocida species: the early stages displayed a cytoplasm packed with ribosomes and very few membranes ( Fig 8A ) ; elongated multinucleated meronts could also be observed ( Fig 8B ) . The parasite membrane then progressively darkened , indicating the transition to the sporont stage ( Fig 8C\u20138F ) . Figures of intranuclear mitosis could be seen at this stage , with intranuclear microtubules and spindle plaques at the nuclear membrane ( Fig 8E; S6A Fig ) . Signs of sporogenesis then developed , with a nascent polar tube ( Fig 8F\u20138H; S6B Fig ) . The spore membrane and nascent wall appeared wrinkled ( Fig 8G ) before becoming smooth in mature spores ( Fig 8H\u20138J ) . The spore wall with its endospore and exospore layers could be clearly observed ( Fig 8J ) . An anchoring disk formed ( Fig 8I and 8K ) , but the polaroplast membranes were less developed than in Nematocida species . In most spores , the polar tube presented a single section ( Fig 8G , 8H and 8J; S6D Fig ) . The polar tube however could be seen to turn on the posterior side of the spore ( S6C Fig ) and occasionally two polar tube sections could be counted in the same spore section ( S6E and S6F Fig ) . The polar tube thus likely folds back anteriorly on the posterior side of the spore on a short part of its length . By electron microscopy , we observed a potential key difference in the exit mode of the spores between Enteropsectra longa ( JUm408 ) on one hand , and N . parisii and N . ausubeli on the other hand . First , the sporoblasts and mature spores of E . longa were never seen to be surrounded by an additional membrane outside the spore wall , precluding exocytosis as an exit route . Second , the spores were seen to protrude on the apical side of the host cell , pushing out the host cell membrane like a finger in a glove ( Fig 6B; S6G\u2013S6I Fig ) . We further focused on spore sections in the intestinal lumen and saw both spores with a surrounding membrane ( S6I Fig ) and spores without any membrane ( Fig 8K ) . On the host side , rough endoplasmic reticulum was often seen to wrap around sporoblasts , yet never encircling them fully ( Fig 8G ) . The host cell nuclei presented a characteristic nucleolar structure , which became organized in long tubules ( often appearing circular in cross-sections; . S6J and S6K Fig ) . On one occasion , microsporidian spores were observed within the host intestinal cell nucleus , whose nucleolus had apparently further degenerated ( S6L Fig ) . The pattern of natural association revealed an apparent specificity of a given microsporidian species for a nematode genus , mostly Caenorhabditis versus Oscheius in our collection . Strikingly , N . parisii , N . ausubeli and N . major infections were found in Caenorhabditis species , while N . minor , N . homosporus and Clade IV microsporidia species infections were all found in Oscheius species and not in Caenorhabditis ( or , for N . homosporus , in Rhabditella , a closer relative of Oscheius compared to Caenorhabditis; Fig 3 ) . The notable exception in Clade IV was the epidermal P . epiphaga JUm1396 , found in C . brenneri . These results suggested a pattern of host-pathogen specificity between nematode and nematode-infecting microsporidia . We further complemented these natural associations with infections performed in the laboratory . To test for the capacity of a given microsporidia strain to infect a given host , uninfected nematode cultures ( cleaned by bleaching ) were exposed to microsporidian spores . We used clean spore preparations from seven microsporidian species ( see Materials and Methods ) , namely N . parisii , N . ausubeli , N . major , N . homosporus , E . longa , E . breve and P . philotis . On the host side , we focused on four nematode species of two genera: C . elegans , C . briggsae , O . tipulae and O . sp . 3 , all of which reproduce through self-fertilizing hermaphrodites and facultative males [19 , 20] . We favored wild strains that had been found naturally infected with microsporidia and were thus not generally resistant to microsporidian infections ( Table 5 ) . N . parisii ( JUm2816 ) infected more than 50% of C . elegans ( N2 , JU2009 ) and C . briggsae ( JU2747 , JU2793 ) individual animals at 72 hpi . However , no microsporidian infection symptom was observed in O . tipulae ( JU1483 , JU170 ) nor O . sp . 3 ( JU408 , JU75 ) at 72 and 120 hpi ( Table 5 ) . O . tipulae strains JU1504 , JU1510 and JU2552 were also exposed to N . parisii spores , and none of them became infected either . These infection results indicated that N . parisii was unable to infect O . tipulae nor O . sp . 3 ( Table 5 ) . Specificity of N . ausubeli ( JUm2009 ) slightly differed from that of N . parisii . By 72 hpi , half of all Caenorhabditis animals and about 30% of O . sp . 3 showed signs of infection . None of O . tipulae worms were infected even at 120 hpi ( Table 5 ) . However , when we made a new N . ausubeli ( JUm2009 ) spore preparation and used it directly for infection tests , O . tipulae strains JU1510 and JU2552 could be infected , but the preparation lost its ability to infect O . tipulae over storage at -80\u00b0C ( see Materials and Methods ) . We conclude that O . tipulae was far less susceptible to infection than C . elegans , C . briggsae and O . sp . 3 to N . ausubeli infection . The host spectrum of N . major ( JUm2747 ) was quite similar to that of N . parisii: it infected C . elegans ( N2 , JU2009 ) and C . briggsae ( JU2507 , JU2793 ) , but not O . tipulae ( JU1483 , JU170 ) nor O . sp . 3 ( JU408 , JU75 ) ( Table 5 ) . N . homosporus , however , could infect both Caenorhabditis and both Oscheius species and thus appeared as the most generalist ( Table 5 ) . Yet O . tipulae seemed relatively less sensitive than C . elegans , C . briggsae and O . sp . 3 to N . homosporus infection . Enteropsectra spp . and Pancytospora philotis showed different and even opposite specificities compared to the four tested Nematocida species . Indeed , none could successfully infect any tested Caenorhabditis strains at 120 hpi . Within the two Oscheius species , specific interactions were further observed . Enteropsectra longa ( JUm408 ) only infected O . sp . 3 strains ( JU408 , JU75 ) , but not O . tipulae ( JU1483 , JU2551 ) , while E . breve ( JUm2551 ) infected all four O . tipulae and O . sp . 3 strains ( Table 5 ) . Pancytospora philotis ( JUm1505 ) only infected O . tipulae ( JU1483 , JU1505 ) , but not O . sp . 3 strains ( JU408 , JU75 ) . Since O . sp . 3 is the closest known species to Oscheius tipulae , E . longa and P . philotis are examples of narrow specialization in the host-parasite interaction . We also found that C . elegans N2 could be infected with P . epiphaga ( JUm1396 ) , showing epidermal and muscle infection ( Table 5; S7F Fig ) . The spore morphology of a given microsporidian species was maintained in different nematode species , indicating that host genotype does not affect this pathogen phenotype . For instance , O . tipulae ( JU1510 ) infected with N . ausubeli ( JUm2526 ) displayed two sizes of spores in its intestinal cells as upon Caenorhabditis infection by N . ausubeli ( S7A Fig ) . Oscheius sp . 3 ( JU408 ) infected with Enteropsectra breve ( JUm2551 ) formed small rod-shaped or crescent-shaped spores along the apical side of the worms\u2019 intestinal cells , as upon O . tipulae infections ( S7D Fig ) . C . elegans N2 infected with P . epiphaga ( JUm1396 ) formed long and thin spores in the epidermis and muscles , as upon C . brenneri infection ( S7F Fig ) . Given the capacity of all Nematocida species to infect C . elegans , we next sought to compare the C . elegans response to infection among our newly isolated microsporidia species . N . parisii infection in C . elegans has been shown to induce a broad transcriptional response [38] . Among genes that were highly upregulated at all infection timepoints were C17H1 . 6 and F26F2 . 1 , two genes of unknown function . Two transgenic C . elegans strains , ERT54 and ERT72 , were generated as transcriptional reporters for these two genes and have been previously shown to be strongly induced in early N . parisii and N . displodere infection [38] . We tested these reporter strains with our new microsporidia species by placing them onto plates with a culture of infected worms and microsporidian spores , then monitoring GFP expression at different timepoints in the reporter strains , as well as monitoring microsporidian meront and spore formation . As expected , N . parisii , N . ausubeli , N . major and N . homosporus could all infect these reporter strains , forming meronts and spores , and induce reporter GFP expression . By contrast , E . longa and Enteropsectra JUm1483 failed to show evidence of proliferative infection and did not robustly induce reporter expression ( Fig 9A and 9B; S2 Table ) . Most interestingly , while N . parisii , N . major or N . homosporus consistently induced the GFP reporters , different strains of N . ausubeli ( JUm2009 , ERTm2 , ERTm6; Fig 9; S2 Table ) did not , although this species did robustly infect and proliferate within the C . elegans intestine . To verify that this differential induction of the GFP reporters matched the transcripts of the endogenous genes , we conducted qRT-PCR after controlled N . parisii ( ERTm1 ) and N . ausubeli ( ERTm2 ) infections of N2 using purified spore preparations that were normalized for an equivalent level of invasion ( see Materials and Methods ) . Indeed , we saw that both C17H1 . 6 and F26F2 . 1 transcripts , along with another gene highly induced by N . parisii infection W04B5 . 5 [39] , were induced approximately 6-7-fold lower upon N . ausubeli infection compared to N . parisii infection ( Fig 9C ) , while the levels of pathogen rRNA ( indicative of pathogen load ) remained similar . Thus , N . ausubeli infection caused a much reduced host response compared to other Nematocida species ( Fig 9; S2 Table ) , despite causing an equivalent , or even more robust infection [40] . Considering the phylogenetic relationships of the Nematocida species ( Figs 2 and 3; S2 Fig ) , this evolutionary change can be polarized: N . ausubeli seems to have lost the capacity to activate these transcriptional reporters as strongly as its closest relatives , or has acquired the capacity to inhibit their activation . Thus , although morphologically quite similar and both are able to infect C . elegans , N . parisii and N . ausubeli elicit distinct host responses . \n Microsporidia are ubiquitous obligate intracellular pathogens that have agricultural and medical significance , but have been difficult to study in the laboratory . Our study provides a collection of microsporidia that can infect bacteriovorous nematodes and can easily be studied in the laboratory in their natural hosts and in related species . These rhabditid nematode-infecting microsporidia seem to have more than one origin within the Microsporidia phylum: at least one origin within Clade II and one or two within Clade IV . We thus here enlarge considerably the spectrum of microsporidia that can be cultured in nematodes , including some that are genetically close to human pathogens in Clade IV . Environmental SSU rDNA microsporidian sequences have been reported from soil , sand and compost samples from North America [41] . ( The corresponding species have not been named . ) Some of them branch in the SSU phylogeny in the vicinity of the nematode-infecting microsporidia that we isolated ( S4 Fig ) . Specifically , some branch close to Nematocida homosporus and some may be outgroups to Nematocida or further species of the genus . In Clade IV , one is closely related to the Pancytospora epiphaga JUm1396 sequence . The clades of nematode-infecting microsporidia that we describe have close relatives that infect arthropods , especially insects . This relationship may be due to deep co-evolution ( arthropods and nematodes being close relatives on the animal phylogeny ) , or to the fact that nematodes share their habitats and interact with insects by using them as hosts or carriers [16] , which may have facilitated a host shift or a complex lifecycle with several hosts . The microsporidia described here can be cultured continuously in their nematode hosts , but we cannot rule out the possibility that some of them may use non-nematode hosts as well , including insects . Of note , all of them use a horizontal mode of transmission , despite the fact that many instances of vertical transmission of microsporidia in arthropods , molluscs and fish are known [42 , 43] . In addition , Nematocida species are diploid with evidence of recombination and thus possibly a sexual cycle [30 , 39] , which might occur in another host . Our results suggest that infections by N . parisii and N . ausubeli are quite common in wild Caenorhabditis strains , especially in C . elegans and C . briggsae . In our collection , N . parisii , N . ausubeli and N . major infections were found in 30 strains of four Caenorhabditis species . Though we have a sampling bias towards France , N . ausubeli was found in Asia , Europe and Africa , while N . parisii was found mostly in France and once ( ERTm5 ) from Hawaii . N . major was only found from three Caenorhabditis strains of C . briggsae and C . tropicalis , all of which were sampled in tropical areas , despite the fact that that we have sampled many hundreds of C . elegans isolates and that N . major can easily infect C . elegans in our specificity infection tests ( Table 5 ) . A possibility is that N . major may be preferentially distributed in the tropics rather than temperate zones , where C . elegans are mostly found ( Table 2 , Fig 1B ) [16] . In addition to C . elegans and C . briggsae strains , we also have a relatively large collection of microsporidia-infected Oscheius strains ( 10 O . tipulae strains and one O . sp . 3 strain ) . However , none of these strains was found with Nematocida or N . major infections . In line with their natural associations , N . parisii and Nematocida major were not able to infect any Oscheius strains in the laboratory . These specializations may be due to long-term coevolution and adaptation processes [44] . In addition , one new microsporidian species infecting Caenorhabditis was found in clade IV , Pancytospora epiphaga . As this Clade IV microsporidian species can infect C . elegans , it would be interesting to develop its study as a model system for Clade IV species infection . Microsporidian species that naturally infect Oscheius species are diverse ( Fig 10 , green entries ) . N . minor , found from two O . tipulae strains , forms two distinct sizes of spores , similar to N . parisii , N . ausubeli and N . major . N . homosporus was found from one O . tipulae strain and one R . typhae and is the only species tested here that is able to infect species of three genera Caenorhabditis , Oscheius and Rhabditella , suggesting that N . homosporus may be a relatively less specific pathogen for rhabditid nematodes . The Clade IV Oscheius-infecting microsporidia are separated into two groups: Enteropsectra species , and Pancytospora philotis . None of those could infect Caenorhabditis and their host specificity is even narrower , distinguishing between Oscheius tipulae and its sister species Oscheius sp . 3 . The SSU rDNA genetic distances between E . longa and E . breve are quite small and two other closely related Enteropsectra strains are also available ( Tables 2 and 3 ) . Overall , Enteropsectra and the Tipulae group of Oscheius species [19 , 21] provide an interesting case to study the evolution of a narrow host specificity . Although microsporidia are known to be able to adopt either a horizontal or a vertical transmission [42 , 45] , we here only observed infection in somatic tissues and transmission was horizontal . Most of the infections occurred in host intestinal cells , while two independent instances showed infections elsewhere . As reported previously , Nematocida displodere can infect many tissues and cells in C . elegans , including the epidermis , muscle , coelomocytes and neurons , although it appears to invade all cells by firing its polar tube from the intestinal lumen [23] . The second independent case is Pancytospora epiphaga can be seen in the epidermis , coelomocytes and muscles . Whether it also enters the nematode's cells through the gut remains to be studied . The most striking variation we observed concerns the cellular exit strategies of the spores ( Fig 6 ) . Nematocida parisii spores acquire an additional membrane around the spore wall and thus exit through a vesicular pathway , using the host exocytosis machinery [27]; in addition , clusters of spores with two additional membranes were observed . If the process is similar in N . ausubeli to that in N . parisii , the spore clusters may correspond to re-endocytosis of spores from the lumen [36] or perhaps to autophagy of internal spores using the apical plasma membrane . Of note , the host rough endoplasmic reticulum could often be seen to form concentric patterns in the intestinal cell cytoplasm ( S1B and S1E Fig ) , sometimes wrapping around the sporoblasts ( Fig 5E ) . Whether the reticulum may be a precursor for the additional membranes through an autophagic pathway [46 , 47] , is an alternative possibility . By contrast , in Enteropsectra longa , the sporoblasts and mature spores were never seen surrounded by an additional membrane , which rules out exocytosis as an exit route . Instead , the spores pushed out and deformed the apical plasma membrane of the host intestinal cell ( Fig 6; S6 Fig ) . Whether the final release step was by pinching of the plasma membrane at the base or by rupturing it is unclear , although the former is more probable , given that the intestinal cells were not seen to leak out . We observed spore sections in the lumen , far from any intestinal cells in the corresponding section , with either an additional membrane around them or none . A possible scenario is that the spores are first released with a membrane , and that the membrane then disintegrates ( Fig 6B ) . Yet because we did not follow by serial sectioning the length of the spores , we cannot know for sure that those with a membrane were not still attached to the epithelial cell . We thus cannot rule out an alternative mechanism whereby the spores are released through a hole in the plasma membrane\u2014although given spore size , this latter exit mechanism would likely lead to host cell rupture and death , an event that was never observed . Of note , another exit mode was noted in the human gastrointestinal microsporidia Enterocytozoon bieneusi ( in Clade IV like E . longa ) , whereby the infected cell itself is extruded in the lumen [48\u201350] . Presumably , the cell then rapidly dies and the spores are released by disintegration of the enterocyte plasma membrane . In the present case of Enterospectra longa , the epithelial intestinal cell remains overall intact and only the spore exits , possibly with the surrounding enterocyte plasma membrane that then disintegrates . Beyond access to a diversity of microsporidia , our collection of host-parasite combinations also provides a resource for defining the genetic basis of host resistance . Most current work on C . elegans and N . parisii is performed using the C . elegans reference strain N2 and the N . parisii ERTm1 isolate , yet this strain combination has been shown to lead to a very strong infection where the host does not mount an effective defense response ( e . g . in comparison with C . elegans CB4856; [29] ) , thus making it a difficult system in which to identify immune defense pathways . The present collection offers many further possibilities of genetic screens using induced mutations or natural genetic variation for resistance pathways . Overall , we here considerably enlarged the resources and knowledge on the microsporidia infecting bacteriovorous terrestrial nematodes . These microsporidia are diverse in terms of phylogenetic relationships , spore size and shape , the presence of vesicles containing spores , host specificity pattern , host tissue tropism , host cell intracellular localization and cellular exit route . \n Hundreds of samples , mostly from rotting fruits , rotting stems and compost , were collected worldwide over several years , and nematodes were isolated as described [11] . The nematode species was identified as described [11 , 33] , using a combination of morphological examination ( dissecting microscope and Nomarski optics ) , molecular identification ( 18S , 28S or ITS rDNA ) and mating tests by crossing with close relatives . Isogenic nematode strains were established by selfing of hermaphrodites or for obligate male-female species from a single mated female . Individuals of strains showing a paler intestinal coloration ( Fig 1A ) were examined by Nomarski optics . Strains with meronts and spores in the intestinal cells or elsewhere were labeled as suspected to harbor a microsporidian infection . Each nematode strain was then frozen and stored at -80\u00b0C . For this study , these frozen nematodes were thawed and maintained on nematode growth media ( NGM ) seeded with E . coli OP50 at 23\u00b0C . The microsporidian strain was identified after the strain identifier of its host nematode strain ( itself identified according to C . elegans community rules; http://www . wormbase . org/about/userguide/nomenclature ) , with an additional \"m\" between the letters and the numbers for the microsporidia . For instance , a microsporidian strain from the nematode strain JU1762 was named JUm1762 . Previously published nematode-infecting microsporidian strains keep their names: ERTm1 ( from strain CPA24 ) , ERTm2 ( from JU1348 ) , ERTm3 ( from JU1247 ) , ERTm4 ( from JU1395 ) , ERTm5 ( from JU2055 ) and ERTm6 ( from JU1638 ) [26 , 29 , 30 , 39 , 51] ( Tables 1 and 2 ) . ERTm4 was previously reported to correspond to N . parisii infection [29] , but as no sequence data was available in GenBank , we also sequenced the SSU rDNA and \u03b2-tubulin genes for this study . We sought to amplify by PCR and sequence fragments of two microsporidian genes ( SSU rDNA and \u03b2-tubulin genes ) from all potentially infected rhabditid isolates . Ten infected worms were placed in a PCR tube with 10 \u03bcl single worm lysis buffer ( 1X PCR buffer ( DreamTaq Buffer 10X , Theromo Fisher ) , 1 mM MgCl2 , 0 . 45% Tween 20 and 170 ng/\u03bcl proteinase K ) , which was then treated at 60\u00b0C for 60 min , followed by 95\u00b0C for 15 min . This DNA extract was then used as DNA template . To amplify microsporidian SSU rDNA , primers v1f ( 5'-CACCAGGTTGATTCTGCCTGAC-3' ) and 1492r ( 5'-GGTTACCTTGTTACGACTT -3' ) [52] were used to amplify strains JUm408 , JUm1254 , JUm1483 , JUm1504 , JUm2009 , JUm2106 , JUm2131 , JUm2132 , JUm2287 , JUm2520 , JUm2526 , JUm2551 , JUm2586 , JUm2590 , JUm2671 and NICm516 . We used v1f and 18SR1492 ( 5'-GGAAACCTTGTTACGACTT-3' ) to amplify sequences of JUm1456 , JUm1460 , JUm1505 , JUm1510 , JUm1670 , JUm2552 , JUm2793 , JUm2796 , JUm2799 , JUm2816 , JUm2825 and JUm2895 . We designed a new pair of primers SPF ( 5'-GATACGAGGAATTGGGGTTTG-3' ) and SPR ( 5'-GGGTACTGGAAATTCCGTGTT-3' ) for JUm2507 , JUm2747 , JUm2751 and JUm2772 . We failed to amplify SSU rDNA for JUm1501 and NICm1041 . To amplify the microsporidian \u03b2-tubulin gene , newly designed forward primer \u03b2n1F ( 5'-ACAAACAGGNCARTGYGGNAAYCA-3' ) and reverse primer \u03b2n1R ( 5'-TGCTTCAGTRAAYTCCATYTCRTCCAT-3' ) were used . To obtain the \u03b2-tubulin gene sequence of JUm2551 and JUm1456 , nested PCR was performed using first primers \u03b2n1F and \u03b2n1R then \u03b2nOF ( 5'-CCGGACAATATCGTCTTTGG-3' ) and \u03b2nOR ( 5'-CAGCTCCTGAATGCTTGTTG-3' ) ( S1 Table ) . PCR products showing a positive signal by gel electrophoresis were sequenced on both strands on ABI 3730XL sequencing machines ( MWG ) . SSU rDNA of five additional N . parisii strains ( JUm1248 , JUm1249 , JUm1253 , JUm1762 , JUm1893 ) were provided by Aurore Dubuffet and Hinrich Schulenburg . The results were analyzed using Geneious v7 . 1 . 7 [53] and compared by BLAST with the NCBI database ( http://blast . ncbi . nlm . nih . gov/Blast . cgi ) . Note that some PCR products could not be amplified ( S1 Table ) . Especially , we failed to amplify the \u03b2-tubulin gene in several Oscheius infections . Both genes fail to amplify for the putative microsporidian infection of the O . tipulae strain JU1501 and this infection could not be characterized . SSU rDNA and \u03b2-tubulin gene sequences have been submitted to GenBank under accession numbers KX352724-KX352733 , KX360130-KX360167 and KX378155-KX378171 ( S1 Table ) . SSU rDNA and \u03b2-tubulin gene sequences of microsporidia from this study were analyzed with those of other published microsporidian species and fungi ( Rozella spp . for SSU rDNA , Basidiobolus ranarum and Conidobolus coronatus for \u03b2-tubulin and concatenated sequences of both genes ) as outgroups ( Figs 2 and 3; S2 Fig ) [34] . For phylogenetic analysis of SSU rDNA genes , 28 out of 33 sequences obtained from this study were compared with 11 sequenced Nematocida isolates ( ERTm1 , ERTm2 , ERTm3 , ERTm5 , ERTm6 , JUm1248 , JUm1249 , JUm1253 , JUm1762 , JUm1893 , and JUm2807 ) , JUm1396 , 60 other microsporidian species chosen from all five major clades of microsporidia [34] and two Rozella species [54] . For analysis of \u03b2-tubulin genes , only sequences from the six Nematocida species ( ERTm1 , ERTm2 , ERTm3 , ERTm5 , ERTm6 and JUm2807 ) and 18 other published microsporidian species were available to be compared with our 32 sequences ( S1 Table ) . To phylogenetically analyze both genes together , we concatenated the two genes of stains ERTm1~6 , JUm2807 , our 30 strains , 10 other microsporidia species and two outgroups ( B . ranarum and C . coronatus ) . Sequences were aligned using Geneious v7 . 1 . 7 with default parameters and further aligned manually and concatenated if available . The alignments were imported to MEGA 6 [55] to estimate the best DNA evolution models and compute mean genetic distances ( 1000 bootstrap replicates ) . Bayesian inference phylogenies were constructed using Mesquite v3 . 04 [56] and MrBayes v3 . 2 . 2 [57] , with the same DNA models as above [58] and refined by FigTree v1 . 4 . 2 ( http://tree . bio . ed . ac . uk/software/figtree/ ) . Worms were frozen in M9 buffer [35] supplemented with 20% BSA ( Type V ) in the 100 \u03bcm cavity of an aluminium planchette , Type A ( Wohlwend Engineering , Switzerland ) with a HPM 010 ( BalTec , now Abra Fluid AG , Switzerland ) . Freeze substitution was performed according to [59] in anhydrous acetone containing 2% OSO4 + 2% H2O in a FS 8500 freeze substitution device ( RMC , USA ) . Afterwards samples were embedded stepwise in Epon . To achieve a good infiltration of spores , the infiltration times in pure resin were prolonged for 48 h compared to the published protocol . After heat polymerization thin sections of a nominal thickness of 70 nm were cut with a UC7 microtome ( Leica , Austria ) . Sections were collected on 100 mesh formvar coated cupper grids and poststained with aqueous 4% uranylacetate and Reynold\u2019s lead citrate . Images were taken with a Tecnai G2 ( FEI , The Netherlands ) at 120 kV and equipped with a US4000 camera ( Gatan , USA ) . Spore size was measured as described [22] . Briefly , infected nematodes were photographed by Nomarski optics and spores were measured using the Image J software [60] . We only took into account spores with a clear outline within the focal plane . In species with two spore size classes , large spores are less numerous than small ones and they are found in groups . When measuring , the spores were first assigned to a size class , in part based on the spatial clustering of large spores . 20 spores were measured for each spore type; except N . ausubeli , for which 42 small ones and 40 large ones were measures . For the microsporidian spore preparation , we first tried the methods previously established for N . parisii and N . ausubeli [22 , 51] . Because wild nematodes naturally live in habitats with various microbes [16 , 17] , the microsporidia-infected nematode cultures generally originally contained other microbes , such as bacteria , fungi , or even viruses . In order to obtain a relatively pure microsporidian spore preparation , we treated the nematode cultures repeatedly with antibiotics ( 100 ug/ml gentamycin , 50 ug/ml Ampicillin , 50 ug/ml Kanamycin , 20 ug/ml Tetracycline , and 50 ug/ml streptomycin ) , monitoring the presence of non-E . coli bacteria and fungi on the plate . Nematode strains do not lose the microsporidian infection after antibiotic treatment . After antibiotic treatment , if the appearance of a plate with infected worms looks like those with bleached worms , we considered the plate to be clean and the infected worms were used to extract clean spores . Even though inconspicuous microbes may still be carried over , as we know so far , none of them could prevent the worms from getting infected with microsporidia nor induce similar symptoms as microsporidia . Antibiotic-cleaned worms without other detectable microbes were harvested in 2-ml microfuge tube and autoclaved silicon carbide beads ( 1 . 0 mm , BioSpec Products , Inc . ) were added . The tube was then vortexed for 5 min at 2 , 500 rpm and the lysate of worms filtered through a 5 \u03bcm filter ( Millipore ) to remove large worm debris . Spore concentration was quantified by staining with chitin-staining dye direct yellow 96 ( DY96 ) . This method worked well on N . major and N . homosporus , but spores of Clade IV species extracted this way could not infect any worms . To prepare infectious spores of these species , we used instead a plastic pestle to crush worms manually , and stored these spore preparations at 4\u00b0C . Nematocida species spore preparations could generally be stored at -80\u00b0C for later infection tests . However , storage at -80\u00b0C could affect the infection efficiency of these spore preparations . Indeed , when we made a fresh N . ausubeli ( JUm2009 ) spore preparation and used it directly for infection tests , it could infect O . tipulae strains JU1510 and JU2552 , with meronts and spores found in their intestinal cells at 120hpi . One month later , we used the same batch that had been stored at -80\u00b0C to infect C . elegans ( N2 ) , O . tipulae ( JU1483 , JU170 , JU1510 and JU2552 ) . At 120 hpi , 100% of N2 adult worms were infected , while none of the O . tipulae strains became infected . These results suggested that this spore preparation became less infectious after being frozen and stored at -80\u00b0C for one month , which did not compromise infection in C . elegans but did compromise infection of O . tipulae . For further specificity tests , spore preparations of N . major , N . homosporus and Clade IV species were then used within two hours after extraction , without freezing . 20 uninfected L4 or young adults ( i . e . prior to first egg formation ) were transferred to a 6 cm NGM plate seeded with E . coli OP50 . 5 million microsporidian spores in 100 \u03bcl distilled water were placed on the E . coli lawn . The cultures were then incubated at 23\u00b0C . The infection symptoms of 20 adults were checked by Nomarski optics at 72 hours after inoculation . If no infection symptoms were found at this timepoint , they were scored a second time at 120 hours post-inoculation . Two transgenic C . elegans strains , ERT54 jyIs8[C17H1 . 6p::gfp; myo-2p::mCherry] and ERT72 jyIs15[F26F2 . 1p::gfp; myo-2::mCherry] were used in infection assays to test infection specificity and transcriptional response of C . elegans to different microsporidian infections . These two lines express a constitutive fluorescent Cherry marker in the pharyngeal muscles and induce GFP upon infection with N . parisii [38] . In the first qualitative assay ( 23\u00b0C ) , we focused on the ERT54 strain . First , 10 L4 stage animals from seven naturally infected strains ( C . elegans JU1762 with N . parisii infection , C . elegans JU1348 with N . ausubeli , C . briggsae JU2507 with N . major , O . tipulae JU1504 with N . homosporus , R . typhae NIC516 with N . homosporus , O . tipulae JU1483 with Enteropsectra , Oscheius sp . 3 JU408 with E . longa ) were transferred to new plates and cultured for two days , in order to release microsporidian spores onto the plates . Then 10 L4 stage worms of the ERT54 strain were added onto these plates and onto a clean plate as control . Two days post-inoculation ( dpi ) , a chunk was transferred to new plate to prevent starvation . One day later ( 3 days dpi ) , GFP expression of ERT54 animals ( visualized using the Cherry reporter in the pharynx ) and infection symptoms were scored . 20 worms showing GFP expression ( if any , else the Cherry marker was used ) were picked and transferred to a new clean plate . GFP expression was monitored on 8 dpi and 14 dpi . In the second quantitative assay ( 23\u00b0C ) , first , 10 L4 stage animals from five naturally infected strains ( C . briggsae JU2055 with N . parisii infection , C . elegans JU2009 with N . ausubeli , C . briggsae JU2507 with N . major infection , R . typhae NIC516 with N . homosporus infection , Oscheius sp . 3 JU408 with E . longa infection ) and uninfected C . elegans reference strain N2 ( as negative control ) were transferred to new plates and cultured for three days . Then 200 L4 stage worms of ERT54 or ERT72 were added . GFP expression of 50 worms ( if possible ) of reporter strains was monitored at five different timepoints ( 2 hours post inoculation ( hpi ) , 4 hpi , 8 hpi , 28 hpi , 48 hpi ) and infection symptoms were scored at 48 hpi . For measurements of transcripts levels by quantitative RT-PCR ( qRT-PCR ) ( primers used see S2 Table ) , 3000 synchronized N2 C . elegans L1 larvae were infected for 4 hours at 25\u00b0C with 5 . 0 x 105 ERTm1 ( N . parisii ) spores and 1 . 5 x 106 ERTm2 ( N . ausubeli ) spores . Prior analysis of serial spore dilutions determined that these ERTm1 and ERTm2 spore doses resulted in an average of 1 sporoplasm per L1 larva at 4 hpi at 25\u00b0C as measured by FISH to Nematocida rRNA . At 24 hpi , animals were harvested and RNA was isolated by extraction with Tri-Reagent and bromochloropropane ( BCP ) ( Molecular Research Center ) . cDNA was synthesized from 175 ng of RNA with the RETROscript kit ( Ambion ) and quantified with iQ SYBR Green Supermix ( Bio-Rad ) on a CFX Connect Real-time PCR Detection System ( Bio-Rad ) . Transcript levels were first normalized to the C . elegans snb-1 gene within each condition . Then transcript levels between conditions were normalized to uninfected N2 for C . elegans transcripts or normalized to ERTm1 rRNA for Nematocida rRNA .", "headings": ["Abstract", "Introduction", "Results", "Discussion", "Materials and Methods"], "keywords": ["invertebrates", "medicine and health sciences", "pathology and laboratory medicine", "viral transmission and infection", "caenorhabditis", "pathogens", "microbiology", "parasitic diseases", "animals", "nematode infections", "animal models", "caenorhabditis elegans", "model organisms", "microsporidia", "experimental organism systems", "cellular structures and organelles", "fungal pathogens", "digestive system", "research and analysis methods", "mycology", "medical microbiology", "microbial pathogens", "pathogenesis", "cell membranes", "gastrointestinal tract", "host cells", "anatomy", "cell biology", "host-pathogen interactions", "virology", "nematoda", "biology and life sciences", "organisms"], "id": "journal.ppat.1006093"}
{"lay_summary": "G protein coupled chemokine receptors are proteins embedded in the cell membrane . They play essential roles in the human immune system . Moreover , chemokine receptors are also involved in various diseases including cancer metastasis and HIV infection leading to AIDS . In case of the chemokine receptors CXCR4 , CCR5 , and CCR2 , recent studies revealed that the proteins associate to so-called dimers , consisting of two receptors . This dimerization was shown to regulate protein function . Consequently , the association of chemokine receptors increasingly gained attention for modern drug design .

To this end , we employed thousands of molecular dynamics simulations of the receptor association process . The simulations revealed similar homodimerization patterns for the closely related receptors CCR5 and CCR2 , and pinpointed the dimerization hotspots on both proteins . Cholesterol was found to differentiate the association patterns between CXCR4 and the related CC chemokine receptors , indicating that both heterodimerization and the interplay with cholesterol play important roles in fine-tuning chemokine-related signaling pathways .", "article": "Chemokine receptors , a subclass of G protein coupled receptors ( GPCRs ) , play essential roles in the human immune system , they are involved in cancer metastasis as well as in HIV-infection . A plethora of studies show that homo- and heterodimers or even higher order oligomers of the chemokine receptors CXCR4 , CCR5 , and CCR2 modulate receptor function . In addition , membrane cholesterol affects chemokine receptor activity . However , structural information about homo- and heterodimers formed by chemokine receptors and their interplay with cholesterol is limited . Here , we report homo- and heterodimer configurations of the chemokine receptors CXCR4 , CCR5 , and CCR2 at atomistic detail , as obtained from thousands of molecular dynamics simulations . The observed homodimerization patterns were similar for the closely related CC chemokine receptors , yet they differed significantly between the CC receptors and CXCR4 . Despite their high sequence identity , cholesterol modulated the CC homodimer interfaces in a subtype-specific manner . Chemokine receptor heterodimers display distinct dimerization patterns for CXCR4/CCR5 and CXCR4/CCR2 . Furthermore , associations between CXCR4 and CCR5 reveal an increased cholesterol-sensitivity as compared to CXCR4/CCR2 heterodimerization patterns . This work provides a first comprehensive structural overview over the complex interaction network between chemokine receptors and indicates how heterodimerization and the interaction with the membrane environment diversifies the function of closely related GPCRs . \n G protein coupled receptors ( GPCRs ) constitute one of the largest groups of cell surface transmembrane receptors [1] . All members of this protein family share the typical architecture of seven transmembrane helices ( TM1-7 ) connected via three intra- and three extracellular loops ( ICL and ECL , respectively ) . In general , the receptors sense external signals with their extracellular segment , while G proteins couple to the intracellular domain . Usually , an additional amphipathic helix 8 ( H8 ) is formed by residues between the last transmembrane helix ( TM7 ) and the intracellular C-terminus [2] . A small subgroup of class A GPCRs is formed by so-called chemokine receptors [3] . These receptors cater for the targeted migration of cells belonging to the immune system and play an essential role in the inflammatory response [4] . Consequently , chemokine receptors became intriguing candidates for therapeutic targets in inflammatory diseases [5] . In addition , certain chemokine receptors have been reported to play important roles in tumor progression as well as metastasis [6] and were shown to function as co-receptors for the human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) during cell infection [7] . Depending on the relative positions of the N-terminal cysteine residues of the agonist chemokine , typical chemokine receptors can be divided into four subfamilies: XCR1 , CCR ( 1-10 ) , CXCR ( 1-6 ) , and CX3CR1 [8] . As reported for a continuously growing number of GPCRs [9] , several chemokine receptors have been indicated to function as homo- or heterodimers or even oligomers of higher order [10\u201312] . The assembly of GPCRs was indicated to have important functional consequences , it may e . g . affect the cooperativity between ligand binding sites , alter the intracellular transport of GPCRs , or activate different signaling pathways [13\u201316] . For class A GPCRs , the interactions between receptors are mainly formed by their transmembrane helices . Consequently , certain membrane components , e . g . cholesterol or polyunsaturated lipids , have been reported to modulate the function and association of GPCRs [17\u201322] . Notably , cholesterol is frequently required in the crystallization process of GPCRs and several X-ray crystal structures show cholesterol molecules bound between adjacent protomers under crystal conditions [21 , 23\u201326] . Especially three chemokine receptors , namely CCR2 , CCR5 , and CXCR4 have been shown repeatedly to homo- and heterodimerize and the association was indicated to modulate receptor function [27\u201348] . Homo- and heterodimerization were reported as either ligand-promoted [49\u201351] or constitutive [35 , 52 , 53] . This discrepancy could be coupled to interpretational difficulties since differences in the measured dimerization data\u2014e . g . from F\u00f6rster or bioluminescence resonance energy transfer studies [54] ( FRET or BRET , respectively ) \u2014could result from conformational changes in preexisting dimers upon ligand treatment instead of alterations of the binding affinity between receptors [14 , 21 , 35] . Furthermore , the modulation of chemokine receptor function by membrane cholesterol has been reported in several experimental studies [53 , 55\u201363] . We recently studied the spontaneous assembly of CXCR4 receptors in different membrane compositions [47] using ensembles of molecular dynamics ( MD ) simulations , in order to unravel the effects of cholesterol on the receptor dimerization at atomistic resolution . Our results revealed that cholesterol affects the homodimerization via binding between TM1 and TM7 , thus preventing these helices from engaging in dimer interactions as observed in cholesterol-free membranes . In turn , the intercalation of cholesterol between monomers induced a symmetric interface including TM3 and TM4 of both receptors ( TM3 , 4/TM3 , 4 dimer ) [47] . Interestingly , peptides derived from TM4 of CXCR4 were shown before to affect the dimerization and further to strongly weaken the activity of the receptor [35 , 53] . The homodimerization of CCR5 was shown in various studies and suggested to impair HIV infection [28] . CCL5 ( RANTES ) , an agonist chemokine of CCR5 , was suggested to stabilize receptor dimers [28 , 32] , however , constitutive agonist-independent assembly of CCR5 was reported as well [31 , 32 , 37] . In addition , monoclonal antibodies ( mAb ) were constructed for CCR5 that can stabilize homodimers [28 , 30] . Ile52 on TM1 and Val150 on TM4 have been proposed as crucial for both , CCR5 dimerization and signaling , since double mutants of the receptor showed neither dimerization nor function [32] . However , these findings were challenged by other experiments [64] . The chemokine receptor CCR2 is closely related to CCR5 , the receptors share \u2248 75% overall sequence identity and their transmembrane segments show up to 92% identity ( see S1 Fig ) [38] . As reported for CXCR4 and CCR5 , CCR2 was shown to homodimerize [29 , 46] and ligand stimulated receptors altered the dimer configuration [35] . Furthermore , similar to CCR5 , residues Val64 on TM1 and Ile164 ( according to Uniprot\u2014ID: P41597\u2014Ile163 ) on TM4 were reported to be involved in CCR2 dimerization since double mutants were unable to trigger signaling [32] . In addition , a heptapeptide containing the residues Met61\u2014Leu67 of the TM1 of CCR2 was shown to inhibit CCR2-mediated cell migration by impeding the receptor homodimerization [65] . Besides homodimerization , heterodimerization of CXCR4 , CCR5 , and CCR2 was observed in numerous experiments and could be connected to modulations of ligand binding and receptor function [12 , 44] . The constitutive heterodimerization or -oligomerization of these chemokine receptors was reported in several studies [36 , 38 , 40 , 42 , 66] and ligand-binding to the receptor complexes was described to induce conformational changes in heterodimers [35 , 40 , 42 , 46] . Negative ligand-binding cooperativity of allosteric nature across chemokine receptor heteromers was reported , suggesting that usually only one ligand binds to a complex of receptors which induces conformational changes at the ligand-binding site of the associated receptor [12 , 38 , 39 , 41] . Additionally , heteromerization was reported to enable chemokine receptors to couple to different kinds of G proteins as compared to receptor homomers and monomers [12 , 29 , 38 , 41 , 46 , 67] . Especially the assembly of CXCR4 and CCR5 gained a great deal of attention since both receptors can act as co-receptors for HIV . It was shown that each receptor can associate with the transmembrane glycoprotein cluster determinant 4 ( CD4 ) and that these associates are used by HIV to enter the cell . On the other hand , CD4/CXCR4/CCR5 heterotrimers revealed negligible binding to the virus envelope [45] . In addition , a mutant of CCR2 ( Val64Ile ) was revealed to delay the development of AIDS in HIV-infected individuals potentially due to heterodimerizing with CXCR4 or CCR5 [68] . However , more recent BRET studies could not indentify different heterodimerization affinites between CXCR4 and wildtype CCR2 or the CCR2 Val64Ile variant [35] . Furthermore , inducing the oligomerization of CCR2 with CCR5 and CXCR4 with a specific monoclonal antibody was reported to block HIV-entry [34] . In addition , the depletion of cholesterol from cellular membranes was reported to reduce the ability of HIV to fuse with host cells , likely by affecting the clustering of coreceptors at cell membranes [57 , 60] . Based on the impact of GPCR dimerization on receptor function , novel therapies are developed to target protein association [13] . Especially the construction of bivalent ligands that are able to bind both receptors in homo- or heterodimeric GPCR complexes have been proposed as potent targets to regulate GPCR function [69\u201371] . However , the rational design of new drugs targeting GPCR dimers is subject to the availability of receptor complex structures [72] . So far , structural information regarding GPCR homodimer interfaces is most frequently derived from available crystal structures [2] . During the last years , more and more human class A GPCRs have been solved with X-ray crystallography and different dimeric contacts could be observed [21 , 47] . Thereby , different receptors revealed distinct homodimer interfaces and the aggregation of receptors is likely dependent on the crystallization conditions [73\u201375] . In addition , certain receptors ( e . g . the \u03b22-adrenergic receptor ) could be crystallized in different dimeric configurations , indicating a promiscuous association of GPCRs [23 , 76] . The structures of the chemokine receptors CXCR4 , CCR5 , and CCR2 have also been determined with X-ray crystallography during the last years [77\u201380] . CXCR4 bound to either a small antagonist ( IT1t ) , a cyclic antagonist ( CVX15 ) , or a viral antagonist chemokine ( vMIP-II ) revealed a symmetric TM5 , 6/TM5 , 6 dimer interface as the dominant interaction mode under crystallization conditions [77 , 78] . However , the crystal packing also revealed TM1/TM5-7 and TM1/TM1 contacts [47] . CCR5 in complex with the HIV drug maraviroc showed dimer contacts between TM1 , 7 and H8 of one monomer and TM4 and TM5 of an adjacent monomer [79] . Interestingly , the previously described residues Ile52 ( TM1 ) and Val150 ( TM4 ) that were suggested to be crucial for CCR5 dimerization and signaling [32] are located on the contacting helices , however , neither residue is directly involved in the crystallographic dimer interface . Recently , the crystal structure of CCR2 in complex with an orthosteric ( BMS-681 ) and allosteric ( CCR2-RA-[R] ) antagonist was determined [80] . Here , no physiological relevant dimer interface could be observed since the protomers are exclusively oriented antiparallel in the crystal packing . In addition , the chemokine receptor CCR9 revealed a symmetric TM4/TM4 interface under crystallization conditions [81] . Thus far , no crystallographic data on GPCR heterodimers is available due to the enormous complexity of the crystallization process . However , in silico methods such as molecular dynamics ( MD ) simulations have proven useful to provide molecular information about the dimerization of transmembrane proteins [82\u201385] . Especially coarse-grained ( CG ) simulations are a commonly used method to study GPCR assembly , since they allow to explore biological systems on the micro- to millisecond timescale [47 , 82 , 86\u201393] . Dimer and oligomer conformations of several GPCRs could be determined and the influence of membrane properties such as bilayer thickness [86 , 87] or the presence of specific membrane components were investigated [90] . The interactions between certain lipid types [90 , 94\u201397] or cholesterol and GPCRs were also studied in CG and atomistic simulations and specific cholesterol binding spots on GPCR monomers and dimers have been found for several receptors [47 , 96 , 98\u2013102] . Besides the spontaneous association of GPCRs , the binding strength of different dimer interfaces can be approximated with CGMD simulations [103\u2013108] . From these studies , energetically favored dimer interfaces and possible energy barriers for dimer formations resulting from trapping of lipids at the interfaces could be elucidated [91 , 105] . In this work , the spontaneous homo- and heterodimerization of the chemokine receptors CXCR4 , CCR5 , and CCR2 is investigated using ensembles of molecular dynamics simulations . Our results reveal that the closely related CC chemokine receptors CCR5 and CCR2 share common features with regard to dimerization and interactions with cholesterol that differ from the previously reported characteristics of CXCR4 [47] . In addition , we provide first structural information about chemokine receptor heterodimers and elucidate the role of cholesterol in differentiating between the heterodimerization of CXCR4 and the CC chemokine receptors . \n In the coarse-grained simulation ensembles , receptors were considered as dimers if the interaction energy ( calculated as the sum of the Lennard-Jones and Coumbic interaction energies ) between the transmembrane segments reached -50 kJ/mol , indicating direct protein-protein contacts ( see Materials and methods Fig 8 ) . Chemokine receptor dimerization was observed at rates of 0 . 2\u20130 . 3 \u03bcs\u22121 in pure POPC and 0 . 05\u20130 . 08 \u03bcs\u22121 in POPC/30% cholesterol membranes . A comparable number of dimers for these different lipid environments was obtained for simulation lengths of 3 \u03bcs and 8 \u03bcs , respectively ( compare Fig 1 and Table 1 ) . Interestingly , the homo- and heterodimerization between CC chemokine receptors in POPC revealed lower rates as compared to the homo- and heterodimerization involving CXCR4 . The strongest effect of cholesterol on the dimerization rate was observed for the homodimerization of CXCR4 , that was reduced by 80% in presence of cholesterol . Lower bound estimates for the binding free energy between chemokine receptors in coarse-grained simulations could be derived from the ratio between the total simulation time spent in monomeric states following the dissociation of a spontaneously assembled dimer complex , and the total time the system spent in dimeric states ( see Materials and methods , S2c Fig and [47] ) . The binding free energies were computed in a range from -25 to -17 kJ/mol for the different chemokine receptor dimers ( see Table 1 ) . As depicted in Fig 1b and S2d Fig , the dissociation was significantly enhanced for the homo- and heterodimerization involving CC chemokine receptors in pure POPC membranes as compared to the homodimerization of CXCR4 [47] ( by a factor of 3\u20135 ) . Presence of cholesterol increased the dissociation propensity for chemokine receptor homo- and heterodimers . Interestingly , this clear trend was mitigated for compact dimer interfaces ( i . e . for higher interaction energies between the receptor transmembrane segments ) , indicating that cholesterol complicates the formation of compact dimers from inital protein-protein contacts ( see S3 Fig ) . Especially , the dissociation propensity for the homodimerization of CXCR4 was increased by a factor of \u2248 3 , resulting in a pronounced decrease in binding affinity by 4 kJ/mol in cholesterol-rich membranes , while the homo- and heterodimerization of all other receptor combinations were less affected . 30% cholesterol content decreased the receptor diffusion by \u2248 50% as compared to the diffusion in pure POPC ( see S1 Table ) . In contrast , the dimerization rates were decelerated by approx . 70-80% in cholesterol-rich lipid bilayers . Thus , assuming a simple hit-and-dimerize model , cholesterol affected the dimerization of chemokine receptors not only by slowing down the protein self-diffusion , but as well by modulating the protein association process [47] . Therefore , specific binding of cholesterol to monomeric chemokine receptors is analyzed in detail in the following Section . Based on the observation that cholesterol modulates the association of chemokine receptors , interactions between the studied GPCRs and the sterol were analyzed based on simulations of the different receptors in monomeric form in membranes at 10% cholesterol content . Specific binding sites are highlighted by the spatial distribution densities of cholesterol around the receptor combined with the contact time of helix residues with cholesterol ( Fig 2 ) . As described previously [47] , cholesterol strongly bound to CXCR4 between the TM1 ( red ) and TM7 ( green ) helices close to the intracellular water-membrane interface , covered the extracellular half of TM1 , and padded the rugged surface on TM5 ( see Fig 2a , TM5 in purple ) . Interestingly , the cholesterol binding patterns on the closely related CC chemokine receptors largely coincided but differed substantially from CXCR4 . The common binding spots on the CC chemokine receptors included regions between the extracellular-facing halves of TM6 and TM7 , intracellular-facing residues on TM5 , both intra- and extracellular halves of TM1 and the intracellular part of TM4 ( see Fig 2b and 2c ) . For both CC chemokine receptors it was observed that cholesterol molecules reached with their polar headgroups into a lipid entry portal between the extracellular halves of TM1 and TM7 . Furthermore , each CC chemokine receptor revealed an additional cholesterol binding spot albeit with lower density: In detail , on CCR5 an additional cholesterol molecule occupied the cytosolic half of TM5 and CCR2 bound an extra cholesterol between TM3 and TM4 . In case of CCR5 , the intracellular-facing binding spot on TM1 includes the previously discussed Ile52 , indicated to play an important role in receptor function [32] . Similarly , in the corresponding binding site on CCR2 , the experimentally addressed Val64 [32 , 68] showed a ( moderate ) cholesterol occupancy . Interestingly , the residues Met61\u2014Leu67 , used for the design of CCR2 homodimerization blocking heptapeptides [65] , construct the cholesterol binding spot at the intracellular half of CCR2 . Additionally , the residues Val150 ( CCR5 ) or Ile163 ( CCR2 ) , recognized as important for both function and dimerization [32] , contributed to the cholesterol binding spot on TM4 . How binding of cholesterol to chemokine receptors modulates CC chemokine receptor homodimer interfaces is discussed in the following Section . Chemokine receptor dimerization patterns were analyzed from the relative orientations of the receptor monomers in spontaneously formed dimer configurations ( described in detail in [47] , see also Materials and methods , and Supplementary Information ) . Relative binding angles between protomers at dimer interfaces can be assigned to individual transmembrane helices ( see Fig 3 ) , thus allowing to compute the relative involvement of helices at dimer interfaces . The closely related CC chemokine receptors shared very similar homodimerization patterns ( see Fig 3a ) , likely due to the high sequence identity within their transmembrane domains ( see S1 Fig ) . As shown in Fig 3 , while TM1 , TM5 , 6 and 7 of CXCR4 displayed equally high binding densities in homodimers in pure POPC , the presence of cholesterol reduced the involvement of TM1 but increased the binding density on TM4 [47] . In case of CC chemokine receptors , especially TM1 was revealed as a homodimerization hotspot . This observation is in good agreement with previous experimental studies , where mutations on TM1 or heptapeptides derived from the sequence of TM1 hampered CC chemokine receptor homodimerization [32 , 65] . Furthermore , the presence of cholesterol did not affect the binding position densities of CC chemokine receptors as strongly as previously reported for CXCR4 [47] . The homodimer populations of CCR2 and CCR5 are distinct from dimer configurations reported previously for CXCR4 [47] ( see Fig 4a ) . Overall , three main homodimer interfaces could be observed for the CC chemokine receptors: TM1 , H8/TM1 , H8 , TM1 , H8/TM4 , 5 and TM1 , H8/TM5-7 ( see Fig 4b ) . In case of CXCR4 , the interface formed by interacting TM1 and TM5-7 helices was most abundant in cholesterol-free membranes , whereas the TM1/TM1 and TM1/TM4 , 5 motifs that were strongly populated for CC chemokine receptors did not contribute significantly to the homodimerization pattern of CXCR4 . Oppositely , symmetric TM4/TM4 or TM5/TM5 dimer interfaces as observed for CXCR4 were barely obtained for CC chemokine receptors ( see S4a Fig for representative structures of less populated CC chemokine receptor homodimers ) . Notably , H8 contributed to the main CC chemokine receptor homodimer interfaces . However , helix 8 was not resolved in any currently available crystal structure of CXCR4 [77 , 78] . Especially in pure POPC membranes , CCR5 and CCR2 homodimers showed very similar configurations ( see relative binding angles of monomers in homodimers in S5b and S5c Fig ) . Due to the observation , that the Martini coarse-grained model may overestimate the aggregation between proteins [109] , we cannot exclude artificial dimer configurations among the less populated dimer interfaces . However , as also shown in previous studies [47 , 83] , highly populated dimer configurations observed in simulation ensembles compare well to experimental findings . The CCR5 TM1 , H8/TM4 , 5 dimer configuration deviates by 6 . 7 \u00c5 ( backbone RMSD of transmembrane region ) from the dimer configuration observed in the CCR5 crystal structure [79] . Under crystallization conditions , the proteins in the complex are aligned parallel in periodic chains , while the spontaneously formed TM1/TM4 , 5 dimer interface derived from simulations adopted an overall more compact configuration ( see S6 Fig ) . The binding position between the monomers of the corresponding self-assembled dimer was shifted by 35\u00b0 as compared to the crystal complex , allowing for significantly more contacts between the TM1 and TM4 helices at the interface and an accordingly increased buried surface area at the interface of 22 . 5nm2 compared to only 14 . 7nm2 for the crystal complex . In addition , the above described CC homodimer configurations are indirectly supported by a mutation study: Val150 of CCR5 and Ile163 of CCR2 ( both on TM4 ) were suggested as important for homodimerization and function of the respective receptors [32] . Both residues are centrally located at the dimerization interface of the self-assembled TM1 , H8/TM4 , 5 dimer ( see Fig 4b ) . In turn , Val150 barely contributes to the crystal dimer interface of CCR5 ( see S6b Fig ) . Apart from homodimerization of chemokine receptors , also heterodimerization between CXCR4 , CCR5 , and CCR2 was observed in experiments and their importance for function discussed [48] . Here , we report the first structural data for chemokine receptor heterodimers obtained from CG simulations . \n During the last decade , an increasing number of studies revealed the role of homo- and heterodimerization of chemokine receptors in modulating protein function by affecting their chemokine sensitivity or altering their G protein coupling mechanisms [43 , 48] . Besides protein function , the ability of the HI-Virus to infect T cells abusing either CXCR4 or CCR5 as a coreceptor was shown to depend on homo- and heterodimerization of the chemokine receptors [28 , 34 , 45 , 68] . Consequently , targeting the association of chemokine receptors moved into the focus of modern drug discovery . The development of either bivalent ligands [71] or TM peptides [27 , 32 , 35 , 53 , 65] to regulate chemokine receptor dimerization and function is largely based on structural information of receptor dimer structures . Since structural detail of GPCR dimer complexes is rather limited due to experimental restrictions , we employed extensive molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the dimerization process and gain first molecular insight into homo- and heterodimer structures of chemokine receptors in lipid bilayers . POPC lipid bilayers serve as a robust membrane mimetic to study the interactions between membrane components in a controlled environment [20] . Based on the observation that cholesterol plays an important role in regulating chemokine receptor function and dimerization [53 , 55\u201363] , the effect of cholesterol on the protein association was additionally studied . Using ensembles of simulations , similar homodimerization patterns were observed for the closely related CC chemokine receptors CCR5 and CCR2 , distinct from the homodimerization interfaces of CXCR4 [47] . Especially TM1 of CC chemokine receptors served as a homodimerization hotspot as suggested before by experiments [32 , 65] . TM1 , H8/TM1 , H8 interactions formed the only highly populated symmetric CC chemokine receptor homodimer interface , while other dimers were formed mostly via asymmetric TM1 , H8/TM4 , 5 or TM1 , H8/TM5-7 contacts . Cholesterol molecules bound to homologous regions on the CC chemokine receptors that differed from the main cholesterol binding sites on CXCR4 . Residues indicated by experiments to play crucial roles in regulating CC chemokine receptor dimerization and function , namely Ile52 and Val150 on CCR5 as well as Val64 and Ile163 on CCR2 [32] , were both located at the spontaneously formed dimer interfaces and within cholesterol binding sites on the receptor surfaces . These findings substantiate earlier experimental studies [32 , 53 , 58 , 65] , that residues which are not directly involved at the ligand- or G protein binding sites but exposed at the receptor surface can modulate GPCR function either via dimerization or interactions with the membrane environment . Interestingly , the presence of cholesterol showed distinct effects on the homodimerization patterns of the three chemokine receptors: CXCR4 homodimer configurations involving TM1 were impaired in cholesterol-rich membranes , while TM4 was more frequently involved at dimer interfaces [47] . Even though cholesterol showed a smaller influence on the homodimerization patterns of both CC chemokine receptors as compared to CXCR4 , the dimerization response differed between the closely related receptors . Thus , cholesterol can increase the dynamic range and versatility of associations of closely related transmembrane receptors . Besides homodimerization of chemokine receptors , heterodimerization was studied in cholesterol-free and -rich membranes . The CXCR4/CC chemokine receptor heterodimerization revealed mostly asymmetric dimer configurations involving mainly TM1 , TM4 and TM5-7 helices of each protomer at the interface but also symmetric TM1/TM1 dimer configurations . Interestingly , despite the high sequence identity between CCR5 and CCR2 , differences were observed for their heterodimerization with CXCR4 . Involvement of TM2 of CXCR4 in CXCR4/CCR2 heterodimer interfaces was enhanced as compared to CXCR4/CCR5 complexes . For the latter , CCR5 predominantly bound to areas involving TM1 and TM7 of CXCR4 . Experiments conducted by Percherancier et al . [35] using TM peptides derived from CXCR4 showed that TM2 and TM4 peptides strongly reduced SDF-1-promoted conformational changes in preexisting CXCR4/CCR2 heterodimers , indicating that these helices are indeed involved at heterodimeric interfaces . The subtle differences between CXCR4/CC chemokine receptor heterodimer configurations regarding the involvement of TM2 of CXCR4 at dimer interfaces with CCR2 turned out to have a significant impact on the cholesterol-sensitivity of the receptor association: binding of cholesterol to the main cholesterol binding site on CXCR4 at the intracellular halves of TM1 and TM7 hampered the formation of CXCR4/CCR5 heterodimer interfaces formed around TM1 of CXCR4 , while it did not impede corresponding CXCR4/CCR2 conformations . Interestingly , the heterodimerization response of CXCR4/CCR5 complexes to cholesterol showed the same mechanism as described for CXCR4 homodimers [47] , i . e . interfaces involving TM1 were reduced while the ratio of configurations including TM4 of CXCR4 increased . As discussed in the Introduction , CXCR4 and CCR5 have both been observed to require cholesterol for proper function [55\u201359] . Furthermore , the HIV-entry via virus-binding to CD4 and either of the coreceptors CXCR4 or CCR5 was reduced upon depletion of cholesterol [57 , 60 , 61] and upon heterooligomerization between CXCR4 , CCR5 and CD4 in T cells [45] . Our data suggest a cholesterol-sensitive heterodimerization of CXCR4 and CCR5 . It appears intriguing to hypothesize that the CXCR4/CCR5 heterodimer interfaces predominantly formed in cholesterol-containing membranes , i . e . TM4 , 5/TM1 , H8 and TM5-7/TM1 , H8 dimers , interact with CD4 and display resistance to HIV-entry . In conclusion , associations between the chemokine receptors CXCR4 , CCR5 and CCR2 and their interaction with cholesterol , were reported to play essential roles in diversifying receptor function . Here , we provide a structural basis for the versatile interplay between the receptor homo- and heterodimerization and its modulation by cholesterol , aimed to contribute to the deciphering of the complex regulation network of chemokine related signaling pathways and diseases . \n The protein structure of CXCR4 , based on the crystal structure 3OE0 [77] was taken from our previous study [47] . The preparation of the CC chemokine receptors CCR5 and CCR2 followed a similar protocol . The crystal dimer structure of the chimera protein containing two copies of CCR5 , rubredoxin , and the antagonist drug maraviroc [79] was downloaded from the Protein Data Bank ( PDB entry 4MBS ) . One monomer , maraviroc , rubredoxin , and other non-protein atoms were removed . The thermostabilizing mutations in the CCR5 crystal structure\u2014Tyr58Cys , Asn163Gly , Asp233Ala and Glu303Lys\u2014were mutated back to the wildtype sequence and missing residues of the third intracellular loop , namely Cys224 , Arg225 , and Asn226 , were added to the protein structure ( using MODELLER [110] ) . The final structure contained residues ranging from Pro19 to Phe312 , the terminal parts of the protein were not resolved in the crystal structure . The isoform B of CCR2 was crystallized in a chimeric complex with T4-lysozyme , an orthosteric and an allosteric antagonist ( BMS-681 and CCR2-RA-[R] , respectively ) [80] . Thereby , the wildtype residues ranging from Leu226 to Arg240 were removed and replaced with a sequence derived from the M2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor in order to fuse with the T4-lysozyme at the position of the third intracellular loop [80] . Here , during the structure preparation , both antagonists , the T4-lysozyme and other non-protein atoms were removed from the crystal structure obtained from the Protein Data Bank ( PDB entry 5T1A ) . Next , the third intracellular loop was modelled according to the native sequence , i . e . Leu226\u2014KTLLRCRNEKKRHR\u2014Arg240 . Since both termini were not resolved in the crystal structure , the resulting CCR2 structure contained residues from Val37 to Phe320 . Finally , both CC chemokine receptor structures were minimized using the CHARMM36 force field [111] . Subsequently , the protein structures were converted to the Martini2 . 2 coarse-grained force field [112] using martinize [112] . In order to enforce the secondary and tertiary structure , an elastic RubberBands force network was applied . RubberBands as established in Wassernaar et al . [82] introduce additional weak bonds ( with force F ) between all backbone bead pairs ( i , j ) within a distance ( dij ) of 0 . 9 nm following the kernel like function [113]: F i j = f \u00b7 e - a d i j 2 p . Here , f was set to 500 kJ/mol/nm2 , a was set to 3 , and p to 6 . Thereby , beads that are by default connected via bonds and angles within the Martini force field , i . e . i \u2212 i + 1 and i \u2212 i + 2 backbone bead pairs were excluded from the RubberBand network . RubberBands is , as well as ElNeDyn [114] , implemented in martinize [112] and was chosen here , since it allows to run simulations using the standard Martini protein force fields [112 , 115] . The application of RubberBands on the coarse-grained structures did not enhance the protein rigidity artificially as it can be seen from a comparison of the RMSD values between CG and atomistic simulations in Fig 7 .", "headings": ["Abstract", "Introduction", "Results", "Discussion", "Materials and methods"], "keywords": ["dimers (chemical physics)", "cell motility", "ccr5 coreceptor", "crystal structure", "condensed matter physics", "membrane receptor signaling", "crystallography", "coreceptors", "physical chemistry", "chemical properties", "lipids", "solid state physics", "dimerization", "chemistry", "chemotaxis", "cholesterol", "physics", "biochemistry", "biochemical simulations", "signal transduction", "cell biology", "chemokines", "biology and life sciences", "physical sciences", "computational biology", "chemical physics", "cell signaling"], "id": "journal.pcbi.1006062"}
{"lay_summary": "Systemic leishmaniasis is known to have in general two types of clinical presentations . The classical form is a full fledged disease characterized by fever , severe weight loss , enlargement of lymph organs and anemia . It renders patients very sick and is sometimes fatal . The second form , known as sub-clinical leishmaniasis , is a milder disorder . Although it presents with symptoms analogous to the ones classically associated with this infection , they are far less severe and certainly fewer in number . In this report , we are describing a third type of presentation , which is distinct from the above described . The hallmark of this third type of clinical form is depressed immunity . A number of patients suffering from repeated infections affecting various body organs and systems ( skin , respiratory , and alimentary ) were referred to us for advanced immune function testing . We were able to identify in a fraction of these patients Leishmania parasites . Upon appropriate treatment , these patients recovered . Systemic leishmaniasis was thus the culprit of their repeated episodes of falling ill . Hence our recommendation in this report is to consider the diagnosis of systemic leishmaniasis in patients suffering from signs and symptoms indicating depressed immunity ( repeated episodes of fever or infections ) .", "article": "Systemic leishmaniasis has been known to present with prolonged fever , hepatosplenomegaly and wasting . Beside this classical form , a sub-clinical form has been identified . It is described with either one or two of the above symptoms missing; other findings have been reported instead , such as lymphadenopathy and anemia . In this report , we reveal a third unsuspected form which we are referring to as \u201catypical\u201d . Patients suspected to be immune-deficient were referred to our immunology specialized laboratory to study some aspects of their immune functions ( not normally covered in the general laboratory ) . Multiple specialized tests were performed , including microscopic examinations using appropriate stains , and mainly cultures of biopsies on several types of specialized media . 19\u00b74% of 160 patients were found to have close to normal laboratory profiles , but exhibited dysfunctional macrophages laden with Leishmania parasites . Findings such as the ones we obtained allowed us to uncover the presence of patients with an atypical form of systemic leishmaniasis . It presents with symptoms masquarading a condition in which the immune system is non functional . This predisposes patients to recurrent secondary infections resulting in clinical pictures with a great variety of signs and symptoms . These findings alerted us to the fact that systemic leishmaniasis presents with a much wider spectrum of signs and symptoms than so far suspected and is far more common than diagnosed to date . Furthermore , among these 31 patients was a number of adults . This proved that in our area systemic leishmaniasis is surely not limited to the pediatric age group . Our recommendation is to entertain the diagnosis of atypical systemic leishmaniasis in any patient with an unexplained depressed immunity state and in whom no obvious immunologic defect can be identified . \n Visceral Leishmaniasis ( VL ) or Kala-Azar was first described by Leishman in 1906 . It is characterized by fever ( periodic or continuous ) , cachexia , organomegaly ( liver and spleen ) causing the abdomen to protrude , severe wasting of the limbs and trunk , and pancytopenia [1]\u2013[4] . Due to systemic parasite dissemination , the disease is in general fatal if untreated [5] . Reviewing the literature , there seems to exist two types of systemic leishmaniasis . A form presenting with the above described signs and symptoms i . e . a classical form , and another type of the disorder referred to as the sub-clinical . The latter was first alluded to by Leishman in 1906; then it was followed by several groups , starting from the late 1950s with Manson-Bahr [6] , who recognized the presence of infected subjects carrying the parasite yet presenting with symptoms far milder . All of these groups based their diagnosis on positive immunological responses to the parasite [7]\u2013[16] . The ratio of patients with sub-clinical disease to those with overt classical symptoms varied from one area to the other , and from one year to another . Its value ( sub-clinical/overt ) shifted from levels as low as 1\u22362\u00b74 to values as high as 18\u00b75\u22361 [14] . Part of the discrepancy in the reported figures is the result of several factors: First , the lack of agreement in defining this disorder; second , the limitations of the varied diagnostic tools , and third the geographic and demographic differences among populations ( e . g . nutrition , genetics ) [11] , [14] , [17] . In all cases , diagnosis of systemic leishmaniasis was dependent principally on the immune reaction to Leishmania antigens , especially that tissue examination does not always successfully demonstrate the parasite , neither do cultures of specimens from affected tissues . As to our area , Bitar and Nachman reported 72 pediatric cases of leishmaniasis from five hospitals in Beirut ( Lebanon ) . They were discovered between 1926 and 1964 ( about 2 cases per year ) [18] . Visceral Leishmaniasis presented then with symptoms and signs consistent with the typical textbook picture . This pathology invariably ended by the lymphatic system's insufficiency , hence total immune paralysis and death of the patient . Over the last 13 years , 160 patients diagnosed with depressed immunity , and who underwent exhaustive laboratory investigations to no avail , were referred to our specialized laboratory for further evaluation of their immune system function . Hence our objective in this report is to disclose to scientists in the field that systemic leishmaniasis has a clinical picture with far more protean signs and diverse symptoms . \n This project received approval from the Institutional Review Board of the American University of Beirut Medical Centre ( AUB\u2013MC ) as part of our epidemiologic surveillance study initiated in 1994 , when the Leishmania study group was established . The project objectives were re-approved in 1999 . We obtained written informed consent from all patients or from their parents/guardians ( when they were less than 18 years of age ) . It was agreed not to reveal the identity of the patients should the results of their laboratory tests be used in any research study . We reviewed all the cases referred to our laboratory situated at AUB\u2013MC with the diagnosis of depressed immunity . Part of our routine in these cases was a questionnaire answered by each patient . We extracted the biodata with special attention to the major clinical features in the symptomatology . We also included the geographic area where the patients lived and live , as well as their personal and family histories . Travel in and outside the area was recorded as well . As for the battery of laboratory tests carried out on every patient , these consisted of a complete blood count ( CBC ) , immunoglobulin titers ( total and subclasses ) , complement activity and titers ( total , C3 and C4 ) . In addition , we tested chemotactic activity using a Skin Window . That was performed at 2 time intervals , one slide at 4 hours for the acute response , and the other slide at 18 hours for the chronic response [19] . In suspicious cases , the window was modified to detect the presence of monocytes with leishmania organisms ( report in preparation ) . Whenever the cellular response on this test was deficient and in the absence of any infectious agents affecting the cells , a Boyden chamber assay was performed to analyze the defect revealed by the Skin Window . In addition , blood cultures on classical media ( bacteria and fungi ) and on Novy Nicolle McNeal medium ( NNN medium ) were also carried out . The majority of patients had sections of biopsies from either a lymph node or a bone marrow , or had an aspirate of bone marrow and less often of the spleen . All of these samples were obtained in the course of the general investigation of their \u201cdefective\u201d immunity and often their anemia . Available sections and/or aspirates were stained with leishman and acid fast stains for microscopic examination . Immunofluorescence for Leishmania parasites was used for confirmation in equivocal cases . For the latter , a positive control from axenic parasite cultures was always included . \n 31 of the 160 referred patients ( 19\u00b74% ) were found to suffer from an infection with Leishmania parasites . Presentation of these subjects and behavior of the parasite in this group constitute the focus of the current report . The majority of the infected patients were from the North of Lebanon ( 48% ) , Akkar District , which was identified as a focus in 1999\u20132000 [20] . This locale was followed by Beirut area ( 23% ) then by the South ( 16% ) and last the Beqaa Valley ( 13% ) ( Figure 1 ) . The age at presentation of these cases ranged from a few months to 45 years . The majority by far ( 84\u00b78% ) were children in the age group between 2 months and 12 years , with a bimodal peak around 2 and 6 years . Worth stressing that there were a few adults . The gender was equally distributed , 16 males and 15 females . Duration of the presenting illness spanned from a few months to 11 years , in most cases lasting between 2 and 3 years . The symptoms varied in severity and nature of the targeted organ . This biodata , including the geographic locale , age at presentation , gender , duration of illness in addition to the major clinical problems that brought the patient , is summarized in table 1 . The most frequent complaint was recurrent infections ( 74\u00b72% ) expressed by pathology either in the skin , the gastrointestinal tract , or the respiratory system . Skin infections ( subcutaneous boils and/or deep abscesses ) , occurring anywhere on the body , were in the lead . To note , these were devoid of any detectable insect bite site . Failure to thrive and Fever of Unknown Origin ( FUO ) came second in frequency . Splenomegaly was found in the minority of cases ( Table 2 ) . Reviewing the results of the laboratory studies on these 31 patients revealed that the CBC parameters were all borderline normal except in one case . The immunologic investigation by and large was normal ( notably , negative Leishmania serology ) . IgG titers were upper normal in a few cases; only in one case , IgE levels were remarkably elevated with an eosinophil count ranging between 6 and 13% ( on repeated testing ) . Worth mentioning that none of the 31 patients had positive skin test for Leishmania and tuberculosis . As for the organ biopsy , it did demonstrate the parasite but its efficacy depended on the sampled tissue . Figure 2 depicts two photomicrographs illustrating intracellular parasites on a section of lymph node ( A ) , and on a splenic aspirate ( B ) . The modified Skin Window was very efficient in demonstrating through its chronic phase the presence of the parasite within and without the monocytes in all 31 patients ( Figure 3 ) . Every time we obtained a biopsy for microscopic examination , part of it went into culture on NNN medium . The efficiency of demonstrating the parasite using microscopy and/or culture is summarized in table 3 . The best test for detecting the parasite microscopically was the Skin Window . The next in efficiency ( culture and/or microscopy ) was Buffy Coat , which revealed the presence of parasites in 71% of the cases . Whole blood followed . Bone marrow aspirate's yield was positive only in one third of the cases which could be a reflection of its depressed activity . Although obtaining a splenic aspirate entails a serious risk ( the reason why we limited it to 2 patients ) , we still think it is a very efficient tissue in yielding parasites . \n Kala-Azar has been established to present with a well defined clinical picture , but for the last few decades suspicion of having systemic leishmaniasis with a symptomatology different from the classically described , has been gaining greater and greater support . Such cases with a variable degree of illness were detected on the basis of positive serology [7]\u2013[16] . In our series , the patients presented with symptoms typical of immune deficiency in the presence of a normal immune profile . Still they were found to harbor Leishmania organisms . In contrast to the reported sub-clinical cases among whom some subjects were totally symptom free while others had a milder form of the classical disorder , our cases presented with depressed immunity exhibiting symptoms pertaining to one or two target systems or organs . A novel clinical picture of Visceral Leishmaniasis started to unfold . It consists of depressed immunity predisposing the subjects to infections with a wide spectrum of organisms ( bacterial , viral and fungal ) . They presented with symptoms varying in type and severity . Although these secondary infections tend to resolve ( with or without treatment ) , yet they invariably recurr . Thus in most patients and before referral , systemic anti-bacterial treatment was extensively used , sometimes in association with surgical interventions especially for skin abscesses and other tumorous growths . Anti-fungal agents were mostly added in cases with gastrointestinal complaints . Improvement or partial relief of symptoms arising from the superimposed infections was reported in most of our cases , but no complete cure was ever attained . Furthermore , it is important to note that none of the patients evolved to display the full fledged picture of Kala-Azar . This form of atypical presentation is distinct from what has been described so far as sub-clinical illness meaning that it is not a lighter classical disease . This entity is novel in the sense that all patients were suspected to be immune-compromised and hence were sent to us for further immune function studies . Incidentally while performing the Skin Window to test the acute and chronic immune cellular responses to injury , we detected leishman bodies within and without the monocytes and some of the lymphocytes constituting the chronic phase of this reaction . Whereas other investigators relied on immunological tests ( purely serological ) for proving the presence of the parasite in the candidate patients , we favored demonstrating it microscopically within any of the appropriate tissues involved . Although the spleen when enlarged seemed to be the ideal organ to reveal the parasite , yet the difficulty and the high risk implicated in its aspiration discourages most investigators from sampling it . Buffy Coat examination has obviously several advantages and was efficient in a good number of patients; however its efficacy drops the more the patient is anemic . Besides , this set of data support the fact that systemic leishmaniasis in Lebanon and probably the area exists to a much greater extent than what we reported in our previous surveillance study [20] . Furthermore , the cases were detected in referrals from only two medical centers . Admitting the fact that the number of patients we are reporting is small for solid statistical analysis , still we think it may not be futile to detect a trend that could characterize such patients . So far the skin seems to be the organ most frequently targeted by these parasites . This is not surprising since these preferentially reside in cells of the hair follicles . Other systems may represent the shock organs being frequently affected by infections as happens in defective body defenses . As expected , it is the younger subjects ( infants and children ) who are the population at high risk . Our major recommendation is to entertain the diagnosis of atypical leishmaniasis irrespective of age or country of patients presenting with depressed immunity , especially so whenever thorough investigation covering a large spectrum of diseases fails and multiple shotgun style therapies are tried without any success .", "headings": ["Abstract", "Introduction", "Materials and Methods", "Results", "Discussion"], "keywords": ["medicine", "infectious diseases", "clinical immunology", "leishmaniasis", "neglected tropical diseases", "immunology"], "id": "journal.pntd.0001782"}
{"lay_summary": "There exists a superabundance of human sequence variations . Testing every sequence variant for association with human disease is often infeasible , as studies must be very large\u2014and hence expensive\u2014to overcome the statistical penalties used to control for multiple tests . A common alternative is to assay only a subset of sequence variants for which there are prior reasons to believe they may be disease-causing . Sequence variants that change conserved amino acids , for example , are often disease-causing . As an adjunct to this approach , we have explored the potential of variants that occur at homologous positions within paralogous human proteins as a means of identifying disease-causing DNA sequence variations . We find that DNA sequence variants co-occur at aligned amino acid pairs more frequently than expected by chance , suggesting that similar functional constraints on paralogous proteins result in coordinated distributions of variants along their lengths . Moreover , if one member of a variant-pair is disease-causing , its partner is likely to be disease-causing as well . These facts provide new avenues for the identification of disease-causing sequence variations .", "article": "The millions of mutations and polymorphisms that occur in human populations are potential predictors of disease , of our reactions to drugs , of predisposition to microbial infections , and of age-related conditions such as impaired brain and cardiovascular functions . However , predicting the phenotypic consequences and eventual clinical significance of a sequence variant is not an easy task . Computational approaches have found perturbation of conserved amino acids to be a useful criterion for identifying variants likely to have phenotypic consequences . To our knowledge , however , no study to date has explored the potential of variants that occur at homologous positions within paralogous human proteins as a means of identifying polymorphisms with likely phenotypic consequences . In order to investigate the potential of this approach , we have assembled a unique collection of known disease-causing variants from OMIM and the Human Genome Mutation Database ( HGMD ) and used them to identify and characterize pairs of sequence variants that occur at homologous positions within paralogous human proteins . Our analyses demonstrate that the locations of variants are correlated in paralogous proteins . Moreover , if one member of a variant-pair is disease-causing , its partner is likely to be disease-causing as well . Thus , information about variant-pairs can be used to identify potentially disease-causing variants , extend existing procedures for polymorphism prioritization , and provide a suite of candidates for further diagnostic and therapeutic purposes . \n The publicly available dbSNP database [1] contains approximately 12 million unique human sequence variants , few of which are associated with any particular phenotype or disease . Large-scale association studies often produce hundreds of first \u201chits\u201d in the form of individual SNPs or haplotypes that then need to be \u201ccharacterized\u201d for a potential role in a disease phenotype; see [2]\u2013[4] . Currently , there exist few methods for prioritizing variations in a locus for use in association studies or to determine post-facto whether an association found in a genome wide association study is likely to hold up to further testing . The large number of uncharacterized SNPs has driven the development of computational methods aimed at identifying those variations likely to cause disease . To date , the most successful approaches to in silico SNP characterization have been protein-based and comparative in nature , namely SIFT [5]\u2013[7] and PolyPhen [8]\u2013[9] . These approaches , often collectively referred to as Amino Acid Substitution , or AAS , approaches ( for a review , see [4] ) , examine non-synonymous changes in human proteins in the context of multiple alignments of homologous proteins from other organisms . The assumption is that variants effecting amino acid replacements rarely seen in a given column of the multiple alignment will adversely impact protein function and perhaps cause disease [4] . However , the complex relationship between sequence conservation , protein function and disease poses a difficult problem for comparative approaches . For some proteins , conservative changes in poorly conserved regions may be the only tolerated changes , and even these may have severe phenotypic consequences; in other cases , even non-conservative changes that destroy protein function may not be disease-causing , especially for non-essential , redundant genes . These considerations suggest that algorithms for the identification of disease-causing variations based upon trends in protein sequence conservation will miss many particular instances . Given these issues , we wondered whether paralogous human genes might provide a source of additional information for in silico variation characterization , one complementary to AAS approaches such as SIFT [5]\u2013[7] and PolyPhen [8] , [9] . By \u2018paralogous genes\u2019 we mean \u201cGenes that have arisen by gene duplication events in an organism and are transmitted to offspring as a gene family\u201d[10] . By this criterion , over half of human genes have at least one paralog . The advantage of using paralogous genes is that information from them is uncomplicated by issues that surround attempts to compare allelic data between multiple organisms . In order to explore the utility of paralogous genes for purposes of phenotypic in silico variation characterization and prioritization , we have systematically examined the genome-wide distribution of sequence variants along the lengths of paralogous proteins . To further test the clinical relevance of these data , we have also assembled a collection of known disease-causing variations drawn from OMIM [11] and HGMD [12]; both of these databases provide extensive documentation of disease-causing sequence variations . We then mapped each of these variations to their gene annotations and protein sequences . This dataset has allowed us to identify and characterize pairs of variations that occur at homologous positions within human disease genes ( Figure 1 ) . We find that sequence variants co-occur at aligned amino acid pairs more frequently than expected by chance , suggesting that similar functional constraints on paralogous protein sequences result in coordinated distributions of both disease and non\u2013disease-causing variants along their lengths . Moreover , our disease-gene analyses demonstrate that if one member of a variant-pair is disease-causing , its partner is likely to be disease-causing as well . Thus , knowledge of a sequence variant's paralogous relationships is useful for purposes of in-silico identification of novel disease-causing alleles . \n In order to investigate the genome-wide distribution of coding sequence variants within paralogous genes , we used two methods to assemble sets of paralogous genes . First , we identified a set of best-hit gene pairs , e . g . every pair of genes whose proteins hit one another with a BLASTP Expect<1e\u22126 . In total this set contained 17 , 111 human genes ( termed \u2018Best-hits\u2019 ) . Second , we identified a sub-set of 7 , 368 reciprocal best-hit ( BLASTP Expect<1e\u22126 ) proteins , which is an even stronger criterion for paralogous genes; we term these Reciprocal Best-hit gene pairs . The motivation behind this procedure was to test two definitions of paralogs: a less-stringent and a more stringent . Defining paralogs simply as \u201cGenes that have arisen by gene duplication events in an organism and are transmitted to offspring as a gene family\u201d [10] , overlooks the fact that it is possible to distinguish two types of paralogs by homology: those that are merely homologous to one another , and those that are each others best hit , e . g . reciprocal best hit pairs . These are more similar to one another than they are to any other member of their gene family . Thus the two sets of paralogs ( Table 1 ) allowed us to ask if the positions of coding variants might be more correlated among reciprocal best-hit pairs than for best-hits; in fact both sets show very similar correlations in variant positions . Next we characterized all dbSNP reference polymorphisms [1] mapped to these 17 , 111 genes , first determining if they mapped to the gene's annotated protein sequence ( s ) in GenBank . As many of these gene-pairs encoded very similar protein sequences , we restricted our analyses to dbSNP variants with a map weight of class 2 in dbSNP\u2014variants that can be uniquely mapped to a single location with the genome ( for details see ftp://ftp . ncbi . nih . gov/snp/00readme . html ) . In total , this procedure gave us a set of 109 , 989 coding variants . We then analyzed each sequence variant's impact on the protein sequence ( see Materials & Methods ) . We first characterized each variant according to whether it produced a synonymous ( 43 , 467 ) , or non-synonymous ( 66 , 522 ) change , further breaking the non-synonymous variants into five sub-classes: conservative amino acid substitutions ( 30 , 690 ) , non-conservative substitutions ( 24 , 070 ) , nonsense ( stop codon producing ) variants ( 1 , 148 ) , frameshift variants ( 9 , 895 ) and in-frame indels ( 719 ) . We then aligned each paralogous gene pair's protein sequences using BLASTP [13] , [14] , and used these alignments to identify aligned variants ( see Figure 1 for an overview of the algorithm ) . In total we found 4743 aligned variants . The ODDs scores for non-conservative , conservative , and synonymous pairs were 89 . 3 , 62 . 1 , and 32 . 2 respectively . All were significant at P\u226a1\u00d710\u22124 ( Table 1 ) . The ODDs score for all non-synonymous pairs , conservative and non-conservative substitutions combined , was 31 . 3 ( P\u226a1\u00d710\u22124 ) . Surprisingly , this was lower than the individual ODDS scores for variants causing conservative and non-conservative amino acid changes . We first sought to explain this phenomenon by asking if it is due to the fact that some types of non-synonymous changes are mutually excluded from occurring at the same position in a codon , e . g . nonsense mutations cannot occur at the first and second position of a methionine codon , but amino acid substitutions can . To test this hypothesis , we regrouped the variant pairs by aligned amino acid rather than the more stringent criterion of their having the same position within the aligned codons . Interestingly this had little effect on either the ODDs scores , or their relative magnitudes to one another . Thus , it appears that the different subclasses of non-synonymous variants have distinct distributions along the aligned proteins . We also observed a correlation between the degree of sequence similarity and fraction of aligned variant-pairs . The Spearman correlation coefficient [15] between the odds ratio ( i . e . the ratio of the observed to expected numbers aligned variant-pairs ) and the average number of bits per aligned position of two aligned paralogous proteins was 0 . 47 ( P<0 . 001 ) among the 17 , 111 best-hit protein pairs . In other words , the more similar the to paralogous proteins , thee more correlated the positions of their sequence variants . Taken together these results suggest that similar functional constraints together with similar positions of synonymous codons in paralogous protein sequences combine to result in coordinated , class-specific distributions of variants along their lengths . Next we asked if paralogous polymorphisms can be used to identify disease-causing variants . To do so we used a set of 2 , 244 curated human disease-genes ( the \u201cOmicia disease gene set\u201d ) , which have been documented in the literature as playing a causative role in one or more human diseases . This list of genes includes and extends a human disease gene set previously published by Jimenez-Sanchez [16] that contains 923 genes . The complete list of genes and their variants is available at http://www . yandell-lab . org/publications/variant_data . htm . For these disease gene analyses we used a different set of sequence variants\u2014one consisting of 35 , 292 coding sequence variants in 2 , 244 disease genes drawn largely from OMIM , HGMD and dbSNP ( see Materials & Methods for details ) . The dataset contains: Interestingly , more than 25% of the OMIM alleles are nonsense , meaning they result in a termination codon , while the HGMD and dbSNP sets contain a very small percentage ( <5% ) of nonsense alleles . OMIM deletion and insertion mutations were not included due to ambiguities in the entry format . Database entries that could not be mapped to the current annotated protein were also excluded from the dataset ( see Materials & Methods for details ) . As our disease gene set contained few genes whose proteins were reciprocal best hits , we instead examined the frequency of aligned variant pairs between each gene and its best hit ( 1448 gene pairs ) within the set of disease genes . We first calculated the global correlation ( using an odds ratio as above ) in variation positions among paralogs for the 2 , 244 Omicia disease genes , using the 28 , 691 non-synonymous and 6 , 607 synonymous variants located within these genes . The results of this analysis are shown in Table 2 . If we align polymorphisms from dbSNP against polymorphisms from dbSNP , the odds ratio for paralogous mis-sense pairs ( pooled non-conservative and conservative substitution pairs; see Table 2 ) is 9 . 5 ( P\u226a1\u00d710\u22124 ) . This means that , among Omicia disease genes , non-conservative and conservative polymorphisms from dbSNP co-occur as paralogous pairs 9 . 5 times more frequently than expected by chance . The value was 6 . 1 for synonymous variants . If we only consider disease-causing variants aligned to other disease-causing variants , the ratio is 8 . 8 ( P\u226a1\u00d710\u22124 ) . The tendency of dbSNP mis-sense variants to pair with known disease-causing variants is less: the ODDs ratio is 2 . 2 ( P\u226a1\u00d710\u22124 ) . As was the case for best-hit paralogous protein pairs , we found that for known disease associated genes the sequence similarity of the two aligned proteins is also positively correlated with the number of their aligned variants ( Spearman correlation coefficient R\u200a=\u200a0 . 32 for the reciprocal best pairs , R\u200a=\u200a0 . 47 for best-hits P<0 . 001 ) . In summary , these results show that even though the proteins encoded by the disease gene pairs were on average less similar to one another than the reciprocal best hits used in our genome-wide investigations above ( 58 . 5% vs . 74 . 2% respectively ) , the same correlations still exist as to where sequence variants occurred along the lengths of their proteins . Moreover sequence variants known to be associated with human disease tend to align with one another more frequently than phenotypically uncharacterized polymorphisms from dbSNP . Next we determined whether or not disease-causing alleles tend to pair with one another more often than expected by chance . In other words , if one member of an aligned variation pair is disease-causing , is its partner likely to be disease-causing as well ? In order to test this hypothesis we first chose a random set of 7000 known , disease-causing variations from among the 15 , 203 non-conservative and conservative ( mis-sense ) variants derived from HGMD and OMIM in the Omicia disease gene set; we called this Set A . We also randomly chose 7 , 000 of non-conservative and conservative substitution variants from among the 7 , 268 dbSNP non-synonymous variations located in these same genes; we called this Set B . We then assayed how often alleles in Set A and Set B were found paired with the remaining 8 , 203 , known HGMD and OMIM disease-causing , conservative and non-conservative substitution variants not included in either Set A or Set B; these were our control set , Set C . Overall we observed an 86% enrichment ( 6 . 6-fold\u00b10 . 11; P\u226a1\u00d710\u22124 ) of OMIM and HGMD alleles from Set A paired with disease-causing OMIM and HGMD alleles in Set C , compared to dbSNP variants from Set B paired with OMIM and HGMD alleles in Set C . Thus , known disease-causing alleles tend to preferentially align with one another . This finding demonstrates that on average , choosing uncharacterized variations aligned to known disease variants will enrich 6 . 6-fold for clinically significant variations . We repeated the experiment using only non-conservative variants , and once again using only conservative ones . The same trends were observed . The enrichment for Set A\u2013C pairs was 14-fold\u00b10 . 19 ( P<0 . 0001 ) for conservative variants , and even greater for non-conservative variants ( 19-fold\u00b10 . 19; P<0 . 0001 ) . Thus pooling non-conservative and conservative polymorphisms lowers the relative enrichment for disease-causing pairs , a result consistent with our earlier genome-wide paralog analyses . In summary , these results demonstrate that disease-causing variants tend to associate with one another to the exclusion of non-disease-causing variants\u2014implying that novel variants in gene A aligned with known disease-causing variants in gene B ( Figure 1 ) are on average more likely to be disease-causing than are novel polymorphisms occurring elsewhere in gene A . \n We have performed the first analysis of the distribution of DNA sequence variants within the protein coding portions of paralogous genes . Our data show that ( 1 ) protein sequence variants , both synonymous and non-synonymous , tend to occur with high frequency at homologous positions within paralogous proteins; ( 2 ) that different subclasses of variants have distinct distributions along the aligned proteins; and ( 3 ) that disease-causing variants also tend to pair with one another . Overall , the magnitude of the correlation in variant positions is correlated with the sequence similarity of the two proteins . These facts suggest that similar patterns of codon usage and functional constraints combine to produce correlations in the locations of variants along the lengths of paralogous proteins . This coordination includes not only common ( MAF>2% ) , synonymous variants , without phenotypic consequences , but also extends to rare , disease-causing alleles . We also discovered that different subclasses of variant have distinct distributions along the lengths of paralogous proteins . Two facts support this conclusion . First , we observed differing tendencies of variant sub-classes to pair with one another ( Table 1 ) . Among best-hit paralogous proteins , the ODDs scores for synonymous , non-synonymous , conservative , and non-conservative variants are 32 . 2 , 31 . 3 , 62 . 1 and 89 . 3 respectively . Second , combining classes always depresses the ODDs score . Thus it appears that each subclass of variant occurs in a specific pattern along the lengths of paralogous proteins , with non-conservative variants having the most highly correlated distribution . One possible explanation of the different distributions is that purifying selection acts to restrict non-synonymous substitutions to a subset of positions in the two proteins , while synonymous variants are free to occur at a greater number of positions; hence the lower ODDS score for synonymous pairs . Disease-causing variants also tend to align with one another . Moreover , they do so to the exclusion of phenotypically uncharacterized variants in dbSNP . Overall , disease-causing variants are 6 . 6-fold ( P<1\u00d710\u22124 ) more likely to pair with one another than with non-synonymous dbSNP variants . When disease-causing variants producing conservative and non-conservative amino acid changes are considered separately , the enrichment is even more pronounced: 14- and 19-fold , respectively . As the dbSNP database presumably contains some undiscovered disease-causing variants , these odds ratios are likely lower bounds; thus the trend is quite robust . Though speculative , one possible explanation of these facts is that similar functional constraints in paralogous proteins restrict rare , disease-causing variants to a few homologous positions where particular amino acid substitutions produce the disease phenotype . In any case , like other classes of variant , rare , disease-causing variants in paralogous proteins also tend to pair . Alignments of paralogous proteins and their variations provide a novel resource for functional genomics . Consider that aligned variation pairs can be divided into three basic classes depending on whether their members are known to be disease-causing or not; Figure 2 provides a summary of this classification system . Each class 1 pair , for example , relates a pair of known diseases , both caused by mutations at equivalent positions in two paralogous proteins . Table 3 shows a sample set of class 1 pairs . Similar changes in similar proteins suggest similar biochemical etiologies , and in some cases overlapping disease phenotypes . Patients with Menkes and Wilson disease , for example , both suffer from abnormalities in copper metabolism [17]\u2013[19] . Likewise Alagille and Marfan syndrome Type I are both associated with spinal , vision , and circulatory abnormalities [20]\u2013[25] . These facts demonstrate how variant pairs can be used as starting points in the search for latent knowledge in disease literature and databases . In other words , therapies and drugs used to treat disease symptoms caused by mutations in one member of a pair might prove efficacious in treating the other disease as well . No doubt , a myriad of issues including time and place of gene expression will complicate such simple conclusions . Nonetheless , these data show how paralogous disease genes and their variant-pairs can be used for hypothesis generation and as points of departure for further clinical research . Similarly , extending this procedure to include paralogs of known disease genes , that are not themselves yet associated with any disease could be used to identify new disease gene candidates , and to identify uncharacterized variants within them likely to have phenotypic consequences . Another use for variant-pairs is in variation prioritization for association studies and clinical validation studies . Current AAS methodologies [4] such as SIFT [5] and PolyPhen [8] look for those sequence changes likely to disrupt conserved regions . Obviously , many disease alleles do result in violent changes to conserved portions of proteins\u2014frameshift , and nonsense mutations for example . Nevertheless , some alleles are more subtle: For some proteins , conservative changes in poorly conserved regions may be the only tolerated changes; in other cases , even non-conservative changes that destroy protein function may not be disease-causing , especially for non-essential , redundant genes . These considerations suggest that a hybrid approach to variant prioritization might prove effective , one that used conservation together with information about the locations of uncharacterized variants relative to other disease-causing alleles , e . g . Class 2 variants in Figure 2 . Our analyses suggest that such an approach might improve the performance of AAS approaches , especially for genes with a closely related paralog known to be a human disease gene . Our results naturally raise questions as to the origins of variant pairs . One possibility is \u201ccommon descent\u201d , but this seems unlikely . Widely accepted models for gene duplication [26]\u2013[28] generally assume that paralogous genes arise from one or a few ancestral duplication events , which are later fixed in the population as a result of positive selection . No matter how numerous the variations at each position in the progenitor protein , a duplication event will fix a single variant at each position in the new paralog . Thus , it seems more likely that variants in the duplicated gene will have arisen after the duplication event , especially for more ancient duplications\u2014and that the correspondence in their locations is a product of similar selective pressures acting on both paralogs . Another potential explanation for the trends we have observed is gene conversion [26] , [29] , [30] , which may provide another source of coordinated variation among highly conserved paralogous genes . Repeated recombination between the new duplicate and its ancestor within a population might furnish the newer gene with many of the same variants as its parent . Novel variants in the duplicate might also be passed to its ancestor as well . In principle , disequilibrium and/or similar variant frequency spectra at aligned amino acids might be used to distinguish this model from the one proposed above , with disequilibrium and similar variant frequency spectra construed as supporting the gene conversion model . However , such analyses lie outside the scope of the present paper . Whatever the ultimate cause of the phenomenon , our results clearly demonstrate that variations tend to occur at equivalent positions in paralogous proteins . This fact provides new avenues for DNA variant prioritization and for clinical studies . \n The DNA variants used in this study were obtained as follows . For the \u201cGenome-wide analyses of dbSNP polymorphisms\u201d , variant data was retrieved from NCBI's dbSNP FTP site and stored in a MySQL database as described below . All fields from the chromosome reports ( ftp://ftp . ncbi . nih . gov/snp/organisms/human_9606/chr_rpts ) for chromosomes 1\u201322 , X and Y were loaded into a database table . Fasta files of the sequence variants were downloaded from ftp://ftp . ncbi . nih . gov/snp/organisms/human_9606/rs_fasta . Each variant's ID and allele were parsed from the fasta header and loaded to a table in the database . Flatfile dumps of the ANS1 formatted dbSNP data were retrieved ( ftp://ftp . ncbi . nih . gov/snp/organisms/human_9606/ASN1_flat ) and parsed for contig accession and version , variant coordinates , location type and orientation . These fields were also loaded into a database table . Finally , a computational biology software library for genome annotations called CGL [31] ( www . yandell-lab . org/cgl ) was used to extract contig based gene coordinates for each human gene from NCBI's release 36 . 2 of the human genome annotation ( ftp://ftp . ncbi . nih . gov/genomes/H_sapiens ) and this data was loaded into the database . Structured Query Language ( SQL ) was used to query the database for every variant that was contained within the boundary of each gene's coordinates and a report was generated for each gene's variants containing their contig ID , gene symbol , RefSNP ID [1] , location of variant on the contig , map weight of the variant , allele , location type , and orientation . The variants used in the disease gene analyses were obtained from 3 sources: OMIM [11] , HGMD [12] and dbSNP [1] . In each case we used a set of 2244 human disease genes based upon a list published in Jimenez-Sanchez et al [16] . This list of 923 genes was extended to include every gene from OMIM or HGMD with at least one sequence variant having a peer-reviewed publication showing its involvement in or association with a human disease . OMIM alleles in these genes were selected as follows . Disease-causing alleles and sequence variants implicated in disease predisposition were parsed from OMIM XML documents . Unfortunately , the positions of these variants on the currently annotated protein sequence are often unknown , as OMIM indexes its coding variants according to the amino acid they alter on the protein sequence reported in the publication , rather than the currently annotated protein sequence . The currently annotated protein often differs from these sequences . In order to circumvent this issue , we developed a mapping process to move the OMIM alleles forward to the current annotations . It works as follows . OMIM alleles are documented by the change they cause , e . g . H35K would refer to a variant that changes a histidine located at position 35 to a lysine . Usually we were able to obtain this information for several variants at various positions along the protein . We then asked if there was a single offset that would map each variant to the currently annotated protein . Consider two variants annotated as H35K and W87S . Although the currently annotated protein might not contain either of these amino acids at the these positions , in many cases adding or subtracting a constant value from both of the OMIM locations will be bring them into register with the currently annotated protein sequence . Assuming n alleles are available , the probability that this would occur by chance would be around ( 1/20 ) n , neglecting amino acid frequency biases . To control for this factor we automatically identified low complexity proteins and manually reviewed each placement on these proteins . In total we were able to map more than 80% of OMIM alleles by this procedure . HGMD [12] allele information was obtained from HGMD as XML documents . These were post-processed , and checked for agreement with the current GenBank annotations . Variants from dbSNP were chosen on the basis of their frequencies ( MAF>2% ) . A publication on the details of this algorithm is in preparation . Once our variant selection process was complete , we then classified each coding variant , using a CGL-based script [31] , into one of 6 categories on the basis of the change to the protein: synonymous , conservative substitution , non-conservative substitution , nonsense , frameshift , and in-frame insertion or deletion . Designation as conservative versus non-conservative was based upon the BLOSUM 62 matrix [32]; changes with a score\u22650 were considered conservative , those less than 0 , non-conservative . All blast searches were carried out using WU-BLASTP ( http://blast . wustl . edu ) with the following command line: blastp db query \u2013B\u200a=\u200a1000 \u2013E\u200a=\u200a0 . 0001 \u2013Z\u200a=\u200a300000 . Hits were parsed at E<1e\u22126 . GenBank annotations ( version 36 . 2 ) were downloaded from ftp . ncbi . nlm . nih . gov/genomes . These were converted from GenBank format to BioChaos XML documents using the Bio-Chaos software library ( http://www . fruitfly . org/chaos-xml ) . The resulting XML documents were used as inputs , together with the variant data described above , to a CGL-based pipeline . Variant locations were first classified as coding or non-coding , and then further classified according to the type of change to the annotated protein sequence . Variants were related to one another using BLASTP protein alignments and CGL was used to map the variants onto the protein alignments , and onward to their implied aligned codons . This allowed us to keep track of both the amino acid and the corresponding underlying nucleotides . Thus we were able to ascertain when variants mapped to same amino acid and when they mapped to the equivalent position within the codon as well . We followed an established procedure to calculate odds scores for aligned amino acids [32] and simply adapted it to aligned variants . The expected frequency of variant-pairs was obtained by tallying the number of variants contained in the aligned portions of each query protein , and dividing that value by the total length of the BLASTP alignments . The same calculation was also carried out for each subject protein sequence . The product of these two frequencies gives the expected frequency of variant pairs . Next , the number of aligned variant pairs ( the observed ) were tallied and then divided by the total length of the BLASTP alignments , to give the observed frequency of aligned variants . The reported ODDs scores are the ratios of the observed and expected frequencies . This simple model for the expectation provides a means to measure the tendency for variants to pair , and to quantify the magnitude of the trend in order to estimate its utility for prioritization and data mining purposes . Although it might be possible to formulate an expectation model that takes into account the relative contributions of the genetic code and purifying selection , this would not provide a means to measure the tendency of variants in paralogous proteins to pair\u2014our goal . To see why , consider that under an expectation model that correctly accounted for the relative contributions of codon-substitution patterns and purifying selection , we would expect an odds score of 1 . 0 , i . e . the observed frequency would equal the expectation . The Statistical significance of the ODDs scores was estimated by simulation . The frequencies of variant pairs used in the expectation calculation were used to produce two strings of 0 s and 1 s equal to one-tenth the length of total length of the BLASTP alignments , wherein a 1 represented the occurrence of a variant . Perl's rand function and the frequencies of variant pairs in the BLASTP alignments were used to produce these strings . 1 s appearing in both strings at the same offset were scored as aligned . This simulation was repeated 10 , 000 times; if none of the simulations had an ODDs score equal to or greater than the reported value , then the reported value was considered significant at P<1\u00d710\u22124 . In practice the simulated ODDs scores never climbed above 1; a rather obvious fact , as given the length of the strings involved ( L\u223c1\u00d7106 ) , the variance from the expected value is very small . Because we used a length 1/10 the actual in our simulations ( in order to speed the calculation ) , the actual P value is likely much less than 1\u00d710\u22124 . This approach was also adapted to estimate the statistical significance of the enrichments seen in our disease-gene analyses . Spearman correlation coefficients [15] were calculated using the Statistics-Rank-Correlation module from CPAN . org ( www . cpan . org ) . Their Statistical significance was calculated by randomizing the data some number of times ( usually 1000 ) and then asking if any correlation of the same magnitude ever appeared by chance .", "headings": ["Abstract", "Introduction", "Results", "Discussion", "Materials and Methods"], "keywords": ["evolutionary biology/genomics", "genetics and genomics/genetics of disease", "computational biology/genomics", "genetics and genomics/bioinformatics", "cardiovascular disorders", "genetics and genomics/population genetics"], "id": "journal.pcbi.1000218"}
{"lay_summary": "Infection by Plasmodium falciparum\u2014the parasite responsible for malaria in humans\u2014can result in a severe disease that can be fatal or in an uncomplicated disease that can be resolved by the host immune system . However , whether the parasites causing severe disease differ from those causing uncomplicated disease is unknown . Several strands of evidence have suggested that parasites causing severe disease may express a restricted set of the Plasmodium falciparum Erythrocyte Membrane Protein 1 ( PfEMP1 ) proteins . PfEMP1 proteins are expressed on the surface of the infected red blood cells and elicit protective immunity . We compared the transcriptomes of parasites causing severe and uncomplicated malaria to determine whether these parasites differed in the genes they expressed . We found that the parasites causing severe malaria had altered expression of genes involved in basic metabolism , nuclear processes , and surface expression of PfEMP1 . The parasites causing severe malaria had up-regulated expression of a set of PfEMP1 proteins . Some of these PfEMP1s had been previously implicated in severe malaria , lending support to our data . Multiple associations identified between severe malaria and expressed PfEMP1 sequences were novel . These novel , severe disease\u2013associated PfEMP1 sequences could be useful for informing design of vaccines targeting severe malaria disease .", "article": "Within the human host , the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum is exposed to multiple selection pressures . The host environment changes dramatically in severe malaria , but the extent to which the parasite responds to\u2014or is selected by\u2014this environment remains unclear . From previous studies , the parasites that cause severe malaria appear to increase expression of a restricted but poorly defined subset of the PfEMP1 variant , surface antigens . PfEMP1s are major targets of protective immunity . Here , we used RNA sequencing ( RNAseq ) to analyse gene expression in 44 parasite isolates that caused severe and uncomplicated malaria in Papuan patients . The transcriptomes of 19 parasite isolates associated with severe malaria indicated that these parasites had decreased glycolysis without activation of compensatory pathways; altered chromatin structure and probably transcriptional regulation through decreased histone methylation; reduced surface expression of PfEMP1; and down-regulated expression of multiple chaperone proteins . Our RNAseq also identified novel associations between disease severity and PfEMP1 transcripts , domains , and smaller sequence segments and also confirmed all previously reported associations between expressed PfEMP1 sequences and severe disease . These findings will inform efforts to identify vaccine targets for severe malaria and also indicate how parasites adapt to\u2014or are selected by\u2014the host environment in severe malaria . \n P . falciparum is the leading cause of fatal malaria and is responsible for the death of over 400 , 000 people annually , primarily in sub-Saharan Africa [1] . However , severe disease also occurs in Southeast Asia , and Papua is the Indonesian province with the highest prevalence of malaria [1] . Severe malaria due to P . falciparum can manifest as multiple , diverse clinical syndromes [2] , but a critical common feature is the sequestration of erythrocytes infected with mature parasites in the microvasculature ( reviewed in [3] ) . Comparative genome-wide analyses of parasite isolates that cause severe and uncomplicated malaria can be used to identify genes associated with parasite virulence and pathology . This knowledge could inform therapy and the design of vaccines targeting severe disease . Although previous microarray studies of ring-stage\u2013and/or ex vivo\u2013cultivated mature parasites [4 , 5] showed no differences between parasites causing severe and uncomplicated malaria , transcriptomic differences indicative of fundamental metabolic variations between clinical isolates have been reported . These differences were apparent in clinical isolates segregated by transcriptional profile alone [6] or by direct [7] or surrogate measures of parasitemia [8] . Limitations of these studies included the need to cultivate the isolates prior to analysis , the absence of clinical severity phenotype [8] , and the inability to directly compare severe and uncomplicated malaria in the same study population [7] . In the current study , we used massively parallel sequencing technology to undertake comparative analysis of transcriptomes from parasites associated with uncomplicated and severe malaria in the same population . We found a unique parasite transcriptional profile that was associated with severe malaria . While elements of this profile were congruent with reported profiles of clinical isolates [6 , 8] , these have not been previously linked with severe malaria phenotype . Genes deregulated in severe malaria were involved in pathways including central carbon metabolism , folate biosynthesis , histone methylation , chaperone function , and surface expression of P . falciparum Erythrocyte Membrane Protein 1 ( PfEMP1 ) . PfEMP1 is the immunodominant , variant surface antigen of P . falciparum [9] . PfEMP1 is expressed on the surface of the infected erythrocyte ( IE ) , where it mediates adhesion to diverse host receptors . PfEMP1 binding to receptors on endothelium leads to the pathogenic sequestration of IEs in the microvasculature ( reviewed in [10] ) . The resulting obstruction is probably exacerbated by IEs binding receptors on uninfected erythrocytes to form \u2018rosettes\u2019 [11] . By switching between single , expressed PfEMP1 variants , the parasite can change receptor specificity and also avoid the acquired immune response , leading to chronic and recrudescent infections . A parasite\u2019s genome contains approximately 60 var gene copies that code for PfEMP1 [12] , and immune pressure has driven evolution of extreme diversity in PfEMP1s such that there is very little overlap in var repertoires [13\u201316] . Even with such large sequence diversity , var genes can be classified into three broad groups based on their upstream sequence ( UPS; A , B , and C ) [12 , 17] . Group A var genes appear to have diverged from groups B and C in their binding properties [18] . Expression of group A and B var genes has been associated with clinical malaria in Papua New Guinea [19 , 20] , severe malaria in Africa [21] , and cerebral malaria in Africa [22\u201324] . The PfEMP1 ectodomain contains multiple , semiconserved Duffy binding-like ( DBL ) domains and cysteine-rich interdomain regions ( CIDRs ) that mediate adhesion to host receptors [25] . These domains have been classified into major types\u2014DBL\u0251 , \u03b2 , \u03b3 , \u03b4 , \u03b5 , \u03b6 , and x and CIDR\u03b1 , \u03b2 , \u03b3 , and \u03b4 [14 , 26 , 27]\u2014and into 147 further subtypes , e . g . , CIDR\u03b11 . 1 [14] . Multiple domain cassettes ( DCs ) containing conserved , sequential arrangements of 2 or more domain subtypes have also been identified [14] . A conserved group of variant surface antigens that are presumably a subset of PfEMP1s appear to be expressed by parasites causing severe disease . These antigens are encountered early in life and are recognised more widely by sera from semi-immune children than antigens expressed by parasites causing uncomplicated disease [28 , 29] . The expression of a conserved subset of PfEMP1s by parasites that cause severe malaria probably explains why immunity to severe malaria is acquired more rapidly than immunity to uncomplicated malaria [30 , 31] . The conserved PfEMP1 VAR2CSA is expressed by parasites causing malaria in pregnancy , but associations with entire PfEMP1s have not been detected for other severe malaria disease syndromes . However , at a finer resolution than whole PfEMP1s , some of the PfEMP1 domains that bind specific host receptors and/or are expressed in severe malaria have been identified . CIDR\u03b11 binds endothelial cell protein C receptor ( EPCR ) [32] , and its expression has been linked to severe malaria in children and adults [33\u201335] , whilst rosetting is associated with severe malaria and expression of the DBL\u03b11-CIDR\u03b2/\u03b3/\u03b4 head structure [11 , 36 , 37] . DBL\u03b25 from group B var genes and specific motifs in DBL\u03b21 and DBL\u03b23 from group A var genes bind intercellular adhesion molecule 1 ( ICAM1 ) [38\u201342] , and cerebral malaria has been associated with ICAM1 binding [43 , 44] and expression of group A carrying tandem CIDR\u03b11-DBL\u03b21/3 domains [42] . DBL\u03b212 binds the host receptor gC1qR , and its expression is also associated with severe malaria [45] . Elevated expression of a number of DCs has also been associated with severe malaria; these included DC8 ( DBL\u03b12-CIDR\u03b11 . 1-DBL\u03b212-DBL\u03b34/6 ) [34 , 45\u201349] , DC13 ( DBL\u03b11 . 7-CIDR\u03b11 . 4 ) [32 , 49] , DC4 ( DBL\u03b11 . 4-CIDR\u03b11 . 6-DBL\u03b23 ) [39] , DC5 ( DBL\u03b312-DBL\u03b45-CIDR\u03b23/4 ) [48] , and DC6 ( DBL\u03b314-DBL\u03b65-DBLe4 ) [34] . Due to the immense diversity seen in var gene domains , attempts have been made to investigate them by concentrating on more conserved sequence or homology blocks [14 , 50] . Few studies have attempted to link these conserved blocks with disease severity , although one study found an association between homology blocks 219 and 486 and rosetting , whereas homology block 204 was associated with impaired consciousness [51] . All of the previously reported associations between severe disease and var gene expression relied on PCR using primers derived from var sequences of laboratory isolates . In contrast , RNA sequencing ( RNAseq ) of clinical samples can be used to assemble all expressed var sequences , regardless of their homology to the var genes of sequenced laboratory isolates . In the current study , innovative bioinformatic approaches were used to identify multiple novel associations between severe disease and differential expression of var gene sequences at the multi- , single- , and sub-domain levels . Furthermore , we recapitulated all previously described associations between expressed var gene sequences and severe malaria . These novel , severe malaria\u2013associated var sequences have relevance to efforts to design vaccines targeting severe disease . \n Parasites were isolated from the venous blood of 23 patients with severe malaria and 21 patients with uncomplicated malaria ( Table 1 ) . Patients with severe malaria tended to be older than those with uncomplicated malaria , but there were no significant differences in P . falciparum density , haemoglobin ( Hb ) concentration , or gender . Among patients with severe malaria , 19 had presented with a single diagnostic criterion [2] , including 4 with cerebral malaria , 3 with jaundice , 8 with hyperparasitaemia , 3 with prostration , and 1 with acute renal failure . Four patients had 2 or more manifestations of severe malaria: 1 patient with jaundice and acute renal failure , 1 with acute renal failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome , 1 with jaundice and hyperparasitaemia , and 1 with hyperparasitaemia and prostration . The parasite biomass marker Histidine Rich Protein 2 ( HRP2 ) was present at higher concentrations in the plasma of patients with severe malaria than those with uncomplicated malaria ( p = 0 . 02 ) . None of the patients had severe malarial anaemia ( defined as Hb < 5 g/dL in children <12 years old; Hb < 7 g/dL in adults; Table 1 ) [2] . These findings suggest that severe P . falciparum malaria in these patients was associated with sequestration rather than anaemia due to repeat infections [52] . RNA quality was assessed using the BioRad Experion system ( Fig A in S1 Fig ) . The median RNA Quality Index ( RQI ) value was 7 . 75 , and the interquartile range ( IQR ) was 7 . 175 to 8 . 55 . Transcriptome libraries were constructed for 44 patient samples ( Arrayexpress accession: E-MTAB-5860 ) . Library sizes ranged from 17 , 054 to 247 , 859 , 790 sequence reads ( Fig B in S1 Fig ) . The libraries were aligned to the Homo sapiens ( GRCh38 ) , P . vivax ( PlasmoDB-11 . 1 Sal1 ) , and P . falciparum ( PlasmoDB-11 . 1 3D7 ) reference genomes , and the proportion of P . falciparum in the libraries ranged from 0 . 11% to 88 . 44% ( S1 Table ) . To identify significant features distinguishing severe and uncomplicated malaria transcriptomes , the transcriptome libraries were subjected to a series of sequence and expression analyses ( Fig C in S1 Fig ) . A pipeline for the de novo assembly of var genes from RNAseq data was developed and verified using a P . falciparum ItG clone ( ItG is the parent line of the It4 sequenced clone ) for which the var repertoire is known . Expression profiles of the assembled transcripts were compared with those obtained by quantitative PCR ( qPCR ) and were found to correlate significantly ( Pearson correlation coefficient R = 0 . 88 ) ( Fig 1A ) . The pipeline used the SoapDeNovo-Trans/Cap3 method of [53] , which is robust to chimeric assemblies and minimises redundant transcripts . Non-var P . falciparum , P . vivax , and H . sapiens reads were filtered out prior to assembly . As proof of concept , the pipeline correctly assembled an ItG subclone E8B that expressed predominantly the IT4var04 var gene . Additionally , the ItG subclone CS2\u2014with a recombination event between IT4var04 and IT4var08 var genes [54]\u2014was correctly assembled ( Figs A and B , respectively , in S2 Fig ) . Alternative approaches were investigated ( S2 Table ) , with the SoapDeNovo-Trans/Cap3 pipeline chosen because it assembled the known samples correctly , was sensitive to low-expressed transcripts , and produced minimal redundancy . The pipeline is available at https://github . com/PapenfussLab/assemble_var . The assembly pipeline was run separately for each of the 44 patient samples in addition to a pooled sample assembly where all the reads from each patient sample were combined ( European Nucleotide Archive [ENA] accession: PRJEB20632 ) . S3 Table indicates the number of assembled transcripts constructed for each sample along with the major N50 and maximum-length values after discarding transcripts shorter than 500 nt in length . For the remainder of this paper , we refer to these 2 assemblies as the separate and combined assemblies , respectively . The assembled var genes were analysed at the transcript , domain , and segment or homology block level ( Fig 1B ) . Three of the severe malaria samples had a low percentage of reads mapping to P . falciparum: SFC025 , SFD001 ( both cerebral malaria ) , and SFM009 ( hyperparasitemia ) ( Fig B in S1 Fig , S1 Table ) . These samples were used for var gene assemblies and sequence clustering but were omitted from the differential gene expression analysis , both for var and non-var genes . Two patients ( SFU2 and SFU3 ) were drug treated at admission prior to blood collection , and 4 patients ( SFC023 , SFM007 , IFM012 , IFM021 ) were treated with antimalarials for previous Plasmodium infections more than 2 weeks but less than 4 weeks prior to admission . These patients were omitted from the differential expression analyses of the total transcriptomes . Significant differences were identified in the expression of genes between severe and uncomplicated cases of malaria . After accounting for library size , parasite life cycle , and other unwanted sources of variation , 358 genes were found to be differentially expressed after multiple testing correction ( p = 0 . 1 , limma/Voom pipeline [55 , 56] ) . A full list of genes with relevant log fold changes and p-values can be found in S1 Data . A mixture model was used to account for parasite life cycle . A constrained linear model was fit using published data [57] to estimate the proportion of ring , early trophozoite , late trophozoite , schizont , and gametocyte stages present in each sample ( Fig 2A , S2 Data ) . This approach returns similar results to the maximum likelihood approach of [5] and is comparable to the approach of [58] , which focused on microarray data . The mixture model correctly identified sample SFC21 as having a higher proportion of gametocytes , a finding that was confirmed by microscopy . Trimmed mean of M values ( TMM ) normalisation [59] was used to account for library size , with samples SFC025 , SFD001 , and SFM009 excluded due to insufficient coverage . The proportion of parasites present at the ring stage\u2014as well as 3 factors of unwanted variation estimated using the R package ruv [60]\u2014were used to account for life cycle and other unwanted batch effects . Differential expression testing was conducted using the limma/Voom pipeline [55 , 56] . The impact of including these covariates in the model is evident in the Principal Component Analysis ( PCA ) plots ( Fig 2B and 2C , S2 Data ) . The choice of covariates strikes a balance between testing power and accounting for unwanted variation . The PCA plots indicate that the outlying SFC21 sample has been accounted for . Furthermore , the separation between the severe and uncomplicated cases shows that , after accounting for variations due to parasite life cycle , significant differences exist between the phenotypes . The severe malaria transcriptomes could be separated by profile of differentially expressed genes into 2 principal clusters\u2014S1and S2 ( S3 Fig ) , which was consistent with previous reports of clinical isolates and severe malaria [6 , 7] . This suggests that severe malaria can be caused by parasites in different physiological states . A previous report also found that median parasitemias differed between severe malaria clusters [7]; the median parasitemias in the clusters in this study were also suggestive of a difference ( p = 0 . 0755 Mann Whitney test; parasites/\u03bcl median , IQR , S1: 43 , 040; 5 , 880; 259 , 378; S2: 786 , 316; 212 , 708; 1 , 095 , 789 ) . However , the severe malaria transcriptomes did not cluster by clinical syndrome ( Fisher\u2019s exact test , all p > 0 . 12 ) . The 358 genes differentially expressed in severe malaria were from diverse functional pathways and revealed a distinct severe malaria parasite transcriptome ( S3 Fig , S1 Data ) . Biological pathways annotated as Gene Ontology ( GO ) biological process terms or Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes ( KEGG ) were ranked using a hypergeometric test , and those with p < 0 . 1 are considered . Terms relating to glycolysis , histone methylation , folate metabolism , and protein folding ranked highly and included genes down-regulated in severe malaria , whilst pathways relating to the tricarboxylic acid ( TCA ) cycle , nucleoside diphosphate ( pyrimidine ) metabolism , and regulation of guanosine triphosphatase ( GTPase ) activity included genes up-regulated in severe malaria ( Fig 3A , S3 Data ) . In addition , genes involved in PfEMP1 transport and a gene involved in regulation of var genes were down-regulated in severe malaria . This suggested that var gene expression was modulated but PfEMP1 surface presentation was reduced . Several GO and KEGG pathways that ranked highly included deregulated genes that were not functionally related in a coherent manner and will not be discussed further . Parasites isolated from patients with severe malaria had significantly down-regulated genes included in the KEGG pathway \u2018Glycolysis/gluconeogenesis\u2019 . Significant decreases were observed in transcript levels of 3 glycolytic enzymes ( 0 . 52- to 0 . 62-fold the levels in parasites that caused uncomplicated malaria ) ( all adjusted p < 0 . 1 ) ( Fig 3B , Fig 3A , S1 Data , S3 Data ) . These were aldolase , glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehyrogenase , and mitochondrial dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase ( LPD1 ) that converts glycolytic pyruvate to acetyl coenzyme A ( acetyl-CoA ) . Expression of most other enzymes in this pathway trended down ( with 3 adjusted p \u2264 0 . 12 ) ( Fig 3B ) . The lactate transporter ( also known as the formate nitrite transporter [61] ) was also down-regulated in parasites causing severe malaria ( 0 . 33-fold p = 0 . 009 ) . Together , these data suggest that parasites associated with severe malaria have decreased transcription of genes involved in aerobic glycolysis . Our results confirm and extend previous analyses on the transcriptional regulation of enzymes involved in central carbon metabolism in clinical isolates [8] . In particular , Daily et al . [6] described a cluster of P . falciparum clinical isolates that exhibited a distinct , starvation-like response , characterised by decreased transcription of genes involved in glycolysis and increased transcription of genes encoding enzymes involved in the TCA cycle , which is similar to the transcriptional signature we observed from parasites linked to severe malaria samples ( S4 Table ) . In contrast , parasites isolated from patients with severe malaria in a subsequent study had a transcriptional profile that was more consistent with a glycolytic phenotype [7] . However , neither study directly compared transcriptional profiles from parasites causing severe and uncomplicated malaria [6 , 7] . To determine whether nutrient availability was contributing to the reduced expression of genes encoding glycolysis enzymes by the parasites causing severe malaria , metabolite levels in plasma samples from the severe and uncomplicated malaria patients were analysed by untargeted liquid chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry ( LC-MS ) analysis . Thirty-five metabolite peaks differed significantly between the plasma of patients with severe and uncomplicated malaria ( p < 0 . 01 , Benjamini-corrected; S4 Data ) . These included 7 metabolites\u2014provisionally identified as lipids\u2014and citrulline ( confirmed with an authentic standard ) , which was depleted in the patients with severe malaria . Citrulline recycling to arginine contributes significantly to nitric oxide ( NO ) synthase substrate availability and thereby NO bioavailability in malaria . Low citrulline is therefore likely to contribute to the hypoargininenia , impaired NO bioavailability and endothelial dysfunction found in both adults and children with severe malaria , in both Melanesian [62] and African [63\u201365] populations . The plasma levels of glucose and lactate were similar in patients with uncomplicated and severe malaria ( Fig 3C ) , suggesting that the down-regulation of parasite glycolysis in the patients with severe malaria is not a direct response to reduced availability of blood glucose . Blood glucose concentrations were also similar in individuals harboring parasites with or without the proposed starvation transcriptional pattern described by Daily et al . [6] . Glucose-starved yeast [66] and clinical P . falciparum isolates with the proposed starvation response-like transcriptome both increased transcription of TCA cycle enzymes [6] . Similarly , in severe malaria , the GO category \u2018tricarboxylic acid cycle\u2019 included 2 genes up-regulated more than 2-fold in severe malaria ( both adjusted p < 0 . 097 ) : the Fe2S subunit of the mitochondrial TCA cycle enzyme succinate dehydrogenase and the putative succinyl CoA synthetase \u03b2 subunit . Aconitase was also up-regulated more than 1 . 6-fold ( adjusted p = 0 . 156 ) ; however , no significant differences in expression of the other TCA cycle enzymes were observed ( p-values > 0 . 2 ) . We have previously shown that P . falciparum asexual blood stages primarily sustain TCA cycle fluxes and low-level oxidative phosphorylation by catabolizing glutamine [67] up-regulating the TCA cycle . However , key enzymes in glutamine utilisation were either down-regulated ( glutamate dehydrogenase down 0 . 4-fold , p = 0 . 012 ) or unchanged ( NADP-specific glutamate dehydrogenase , aspartate transaminase , glutamate synthase , malate dehydrogenase , phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase , and branched chain ketoacid dehydrogenase complex [BCKDH] subunits E1\u03b2 and E2 ) in isolates from patients with severe malaria , indicating that these parasites are unlikely to exhibit a significant switch to mitochondrial respiration . Overall , these data suggest that parasites associated with severe malaria were not compensating for decreased glycolysis by increasing oxidation of pyruvate in the TCA cycle and may be metabolically less active than parasite isolates associated with uncomplicated malaria . The GO term \u2018methylation\u2019 and a number of subsidiary GO terms relating to histone methylation included genes down-regulated in parasites causing severe malaria . The down-regulated genes included a putative histone S-adenosyl methyltransferase and 2 of the 10 SET-domain lysine methyl transferases found in P . falciparum ( SET2 and PfSET7 ) . Levels of SET3 and a putative protein arginine N-methyltransferase 1 ( PfPRMT1 ) were also suggestive of down-regulation ( both adjusted p < 0 . 11 , <0 . 73-fold ) . PfSETvs or SET2 plays an important role in regulating expression of var genes ( see below ) . PfSET3 and PfSET7 appear essential for blood-stage growth [68] , and PfSET7 can methylate H3 but is localised to the cytoplasm in asexual blood stages [69] . PfPRMT1 probably methylates cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins including methylations of histone 4 that are involved in gene activation [70] . These data suggest that histone methylation pathways involved in gene regulation were down-regulated in severe malaria . Genes involved in chromatin modification were also deregulated by parasites previously reported to have caused high parasitaemia infections [8] . Severe malaria is known to elicit gametocytogenesis , and heterochromatin structure dependent on histone methylation is known to repress the gametocytogenesis transcription factor ApiAP2G [71] , so down-regulation of histone methylation would be consistent with induction of gametocytogenesis in severe malaria . The KEGG term \u2018folate biosynthesis\u2019 and a number of related GO terms included 2 genes down-regulated in severe malaria: dihydropteroate synthetase ( DHPS ) and guanosine triphosphate ( GTP ) cyclohydrolase . GTP cyclohydrolase is the first and rate-limiting enzyme in the folate pathway and therefore is essential for DNA and protein synthesis . Aspartate carbamoyltransferase ( ATCase ) was also down-regulated; it is the second enzyme in the pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway; and whether it is rate limiting in P . falciparum is unknown , but it is so in bacteria [72] . These changes suggest that nucleoside biosynthesis may be decreased in severe malaria , consistent with lower growth rate and/or reduced metabolism . A number of GO pathways related to nucleoside diphosphate and pyrimidine metabolism included 2 genes up-regulated in severe malaria: nucleoside diphosphate kinase ( NDK ) and the putative small subunit of ribonucleotide reductase . These 2 genes are central to ribonucleoside triphosphate ( NTP ) and deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate ( dNTP ) synthesis . Although up-regulation of these enzymes suggests increased DNA synthesis , the down-regulation of key enzymes in the folate and pyrimidine pathways instead indicates that a diminished nucleoside pool is subject to increased flux through ribonucleoside diphosphate ( NDP ) to dNTP metabolism . The GO term \u2018translational elongation\u2019 included 3 down-regulated elongation factor genes suggesting decreased protein production . The GO term \u2018protein folding\u2019 included 9 down-regulated genes , including the HSP70 interacting protein ( HIP ) , the peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase cytochrome P450 52 ( CYP52 ) \u2014which has in vitro chaperone activity ( Marin-Menendez , 2012 ) \u2014an FK506 binding protein ( FKBP ) -type peptidyl-prolyl isomerase , and the PfEMP1 transport\u2013associated KAHsp40 . Functionally related proteins outside this pathway were also down-regulated , including the hsp70/hsp90 organising protein ( HOP ) , HSP70-x ( see below ) , and the essential PfHsp110c , which is important for preventing heat-induced aggregation of the many P . falciparum Asn repeat rich proteins during fever [73] . Overall , down-regulation of these genes indicated a decreased stress response or generalised , decreased protein processing . The GO category \u2018regulation of GTPase activity\u2019 and related GO categories included 3 GTPase-activating protein genes that were up-regulated in severe malaria , 2 of which were specific for Rab GTPases . This would be consistent with decreased Rab GTPase trafficking regulatory activity and therefore decreased vesicular transport . Two genes involved in vesicle transport were down-regulated; these were SNAP proteins , which is involved in dissociation of the Soluble NSF ( N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor ) Attachment Protein Receptor ( SNARE ) complex , and choline-phosphate cytidylyltransferase ( CCT ) , which is rate limiting for synthesis of the major P . falciparum membrane phospholipid , phosphatidylcholine [74] . Four genes involved in vesicle transport were up-regulated . These included 2 proteins involved in endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) to Golgi transport , the trafficking protein particle complex subunit 5 ( TRAPPC5 ) , and the SNARE protein PfGS27; the retrieval receptor for ER membrane proteins , which is required for anterograde vesicular transport; and the vacuolar protein sorting\u2013associated protein 45 that is implicated in vesicle transport from the Golgi to endosomes or the food vacuole . Overall , the probable decreased trafficking activity of several Rabs and deregulated vesicle transport processes suggest deregulated protein trafficking in severe malaria . Multiple genes involved in PfEMP1 biology were down-regulated in severe malaria . These included PfSETvs\u2014which methylates lysine 36 on histone 3 , is required for var gene silencing [68] , and is involved in normal var switching [75] . The knob-localised KAHRP\u2014which binds PfEMP1 and the cytoskeleton\u2014and the lysine-rich , membrane-associated PHISTb protein ( LyMP ) ( PF3D7_0532400 ) are both required for optimal binding of PfEMP1 to ( some ) receptors [76] and were amongst the most down-regulated genes in severe malaria . Also down-regulated were the following: the Maurers cleft proteins SBP1 and REX1 , which are required for proper Maurer\u2019s cleft organization and PfEMP1 transport to the erythrocyte surface [77\u201379]; Heat shock protein 70-x , which forms a complex with Hsp40 in the red blood cell cytosol and is possibly involved in PfEMP1 transport [80]; and KAHsp40 , which binds PfEMP3 and KAHRP and colocalises with knob-associated proteins [81] . Therefore , we observed probable mechanistic drivers of modulated var regulation and decreased transport of PfEMP1 to the parasite surface . GO categories that were highly ranked due primarily to inclusion of deregulated 3D7 var genes were not reported because 3D7 var genes were not present in the clinical isolates . Several parasite surface proteins with established functions unrelated to ring-stage parasites were highly up-regulated in severe malaria . The second most up-regulated gene encoded the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored cysteine-rich protective antigen ( CyRPA ) that anchors the critical invasion protein Plasmodium falciparum reticulocyte-binding protein homolog 5 ( PfRh5 ) to the surface of the merozoite [82]; the seventh most up-regulated gene was the merozoite surface-located 6-cysteine protein P41 [83] , and the 14th most up-regulated gene was sporozoite invasion-associated protein-2 ( SIAP-2 ) . This gene is expressed at low levels in blood-stage cultures but at high levels on the surface of sporozoites , and it appears to be important for hepatocyte traversal [84] . The serpentine receptor 10 was also up-regulated . It is most closely related to receptors that transduce external stimuli in other organisms [85] . There was no difference between severe malaria and uncomplicated malaria in total var gene expression , i . e . , the number of reads that mapped to de novo\u2013assembled var genes ( normalised for number of total reads that mapped to all genes; Welch 2-sample t test , p = 0 . 28 ) . Differential expression analysis was conducted at the var multidomain transcript , individual domain , and segment levels because associations between var expression and severe disease have been previously detected separately at each of these resolutions . At each level , significant , differentially expressed sequences were identified . Additionally , the resulting sequence transcripts , domain classification , and segments were found to better distinguish severe and nonsevere cases of malaria than previous var gene classifications [14 , 39 , 46 , 48] . Fig B in S4 Fig illustrates a PCA plot of normalised read counts annotated to the transcripts from the combined sample var gene assembly . By comparing it to the all-gene PCA plot ( Fig 2C ) , it is evident that var gene expression differentiates severe cases of malaria . The severe cases are more tightly clustered together than the nonsevere . S5 Data lists all the separate sample assembly transcripts along with whether they were significant at the transcript , domain , or segment level . A number of transcripts had domains and segments that were significantly associated with disease severity when the transcript itself was found not to be significantly associated with severe disease . This highlights the importance of investigating the var gene sequences at multiple resolutions . In the combined sample assembly ( S6 Data ) , 53 transcripts were found to be differentially expressed using the default DESeq2 pipeline [86] . Of these , 17 are up-regulated in severe malaria ( p < 0 . 05 ) ( Fig 4A ) . The expression profiles of the up-regulated transcripts from the combined assembly differentiated the samples based on severity ( Fig 4A , S4 Fig , panel B ) . Amongst the transcripts up-regulated in severe malaria , the extracellular domains most highly expressed in severe malaria were a DBL\u03b64 ( 284084_soapGraphK61 ) , a DBL\u03b53 ( 274611_soapGraphK61 ) , and a DBL\u03b512 ( Contig1811 ) ( Fig 4B ) . The up-regulated transcripts included a transcript that contained DBL\u03b25-DBL\u03b314 ( 298068_soapGraphK61 ) ; DBL\u03b314 has only been found in DC6 [14] , and its expression was recently associated with severe disease [34] . In 7 P . falciparum genomes [14] , the tandem combination DBL\u03b25-DBL\u03b314 was detected only in the 3D7 gene PFL0020w , which is expressed by 3D7 parasites selected for adhesion to ICAM1 [87] . Another of the up-regulated transcripts contained DBL\u03b318-DBL\u03b514 ( Contig3067 ) ; this tandem domain arrangement was only detected twice in the 7 sequenced genomes but was not part of any DCs . The remaining transcripts were either single domains or common tandem domain arrangements . A transcript incorporating DC5 ( DBL\u03b45-CIDR\u03b23-DBL\u03b27-[DBL\u03b34] ) ( contig12688 ) was also up-regulated in severe malaria ( p = 0 . 0537 ) . DC5 was up-regulated in severe malaria in Africa [48] and expressed in a cerebral malaria case in Papua New Guinea [88] . Corset [89] groups transcripts together based on the number of reads that multi-map between them whilst ensuring transcripts are not combined if they have significantly different expression profiles . We used Corset to detect transcripts associated with severe disease in the separate sample assemblies . Associations between severe disease and var transcripts can be inferred with greater confidence if identified using multiple approaches . Corset identified 82 differentially expressed clusters in total , of which 5 were clearly up-regulated in severe disease ( Fig 5A , S7 Data ) . These clusters included overlapping , multidomain contigs that spanned DC4 ( N-terminal sequence A [NTSA]-DBL\u03b11 . 2/1 . 5/1 . 4-CIDR\u03b11 . 6-DBL\u03b23-[DBL\u03b311-DBL\u03b41-CIDR\u03b21/2] ) ( cluster-10 . 1182 ) and DC11 ( CIDR\u03b24-DBL\u03b37-DBL\u03b511-DBL\u03b62-DBL\u03b511-DBL\u03b53 ) ( cluster-10 . 1147 ) . The contigs spanning DC4 were the most abundantly expressed of the clustered contigs up-regulated in severe malaria ( Fig 5B ) . DC4 expression has previously been associated with severe malaria [39] , and the DC4 cluster included 2 DC4 transcripts from the cerebral malaria sample SFC15 . For each transcript in the separate assembly , its closest basic local alignment search tool ( BLAST ) [90] hit in the combined assembly was identified . Of the 5 Corset clusters up-regulated in severe malaria , 2 included transcripts with their closest BLAST hit in the 17 up-regulated transcripts from the combined assembly . These were the DC4 cluster\u2014which was homologous to the DBL\u03b41-CIDR\u03b21 combined assembly transcript 297752_soapGraphK61\u2014and cluster-10 . 839 ( N-terminal sequence B [NTSB]-DBL\u03b10 . 5-CIDR\u03b12 . 6/3 . 4-DBL\u03b25/8/13-DBL\u03b41-CIDR\u03b25 ) \u2014which was homologous to the combined assembly transcript 284128_soapGraphK61 ( CIDR\u03b12 . 6-DBL\u03b28 ) ( Fig 6 ) . The 2 remaining clusters contained transcripts spanning NTSB-DBL\u03b10 . 1/0 . 4-CIDR\u03b13 . 1/4-DBL\u03b41-CIDR\u03b21/7 ( cluster-10 . 583 ) and NTSB-DBL\u03b10 . 5-CIDR\u03b12 . 2/2 . 3/2 . 6/2 . 8-DBL\u03b41-CIDR\u03b21 ( cluster-10 . 548 ) . These 2 clusters and the DC4 and DC11 clusters were all homologous to additional transcripts that were up-regulated in the combined assembly at an adjusted p-value of no more than 0 . 153 ( Fig 6 ) . The elevated p-values in the combined assembly analysis can be explained by the heavier multiple testing penalty due to the larger number of transcripts . For simplicity , we restricted our analysis at the type level to distinguishing between UPS types A and B/C combined . Expression of the conserved NTS segments allows for these 2 groups to be identified . HMMER3 [91] was used to align the profile hidden Markov models of the domains defined in [14] to the transcripts built from the separate assemblies . Reads that aligned to the regions annotated as either NTSA or NTSB were then used as counts for the respective var types . NTSA was more highly expressed in the severe malaria samples than in the uncomplicated malaria samples ( Fig A in S4 Fig ) . This is consistent with previous studies [19\u201323 , 34 , 92] . The domain models of [14] were first investigated using the same approach as the type-level analysis . Of the 149 domain classifications identified in the transcripts , 16 were found to be significantly up-regulated in severe malaria using the default pipeline of DESeq2 [86] ( S8 Data , Fig 7A ) . Some previously described associations between expressed var sequences and severe malaria were confirmed , adding confidence to our analysis . These included up-regulation in severe malaria of CIDR\u03b11 . 1 and CIDR\u03b11 . 6 , which bind EPCR [35] and are often found in DC8 and DC4 , respectively [32 , 34 , 45 , 46 , 48 , 49]; DBL\u03b12 , which is restricted to DC8; and DBL\u03b212 , which binds gC1qR [45] and is invariably found in DC8 . DBL\u03b23 was also up-regulated; it can bind ICAM1 and is found in\u2014but is not restricted to\u2014severe malaria\u2013associated DC4 [39] and DC8 . The domain subtypes DBL\u03b23 , CIDR\u03b11 . 6 , DBL\u03b11 . 2 , DBL\u03b11 . 5 , and DBL\u03b311 that were all up-regulated in this analysis were also part of the up-regulated DC4 transcript in the Corset analysis ( Fig 6 , Fig 5A , S5 Data , S7 Data ) . NTSA that is restricted to group A var genes was also up-regulated . Despite these clear differences , many of the domains were still expressed in a large number of the uncomplicated samples , e . g . , DBL\u03b23 was far more abundantly expressed than CIDR\u03b11 . 6 and DBL\u03b11 . 5 , but the latter 2 domains were more clearly differentially expressed in severe malaria ( Fig 7A , Fig 8B ) . Comparing the domain-level PCA plot in Fig 7B with the transcript-level PCA plot in Fig B in S4 Fig showed that the differentiation between severe and uncomplicated malaria samples was less evident at the domain level and suggested that a more accurate classification could be made . A novel hierarchical approach was developed to identify domains that are associated with severe malaria . Domain regions were first defined using HMMER3 domain models based on the domain sequences identified in [14] . The identified domain regions were then hierarchically clustered using USEARCH [93] as described in the Materials and methods section at sequence identity levels 50 , 55 , 60 , 65 , 70 , 75 , 80 , 85 , 90 , 95 , and 97 . The counts for each cluster were aggregated up the hierarchical tree , and differential expression was tested at each node . Benjamini-Yekutieli [94] multiple testing correction was performed before the most significant node was successively chosen and added to the list of significant clusters . The children and parents of each node were removed from the list of potential clusters before the next node was chosen in the tree . A more detailed description is given in the Materials and methods section . This approach attempts to identify the point , or node , in the hierarchical tree that best distinguishes domains associated with severe disease from those that are not . By looking at different levels of the tree , we are able to identify potentially important domain groups that would otherwise remain elusive . Additionally , by grouping domains at various identity levels , we are increasing the sensitivity to domain groups with higher sequence variation such as the DBL\u03b4 domain class . Fig 7C illustrates the advantage of this approach by focusing on a tree related to the DBL\u03b53 domain of [14] . At 70% identity , no clusters are significantly associated with severe disease . However , at 65% , 1 cluster ( DBL\u03b53 . s . 1 ) becomes significant . This difference is then lost at 50% identity . A PCA plot of the clusters at 50% identity is shown in Fig 7D . It provides a much clearer grouping of the severe samples than the previous domain definitions . Similar groupings are seen at all levels of the tree ( S5 Fig ) . The tree-building approach identified 70 differentially expressed domain clusters , of which 15 are up-regulated in severe malaria ( S9 Data ) . To investigate possible associations between these 15 clusters , they were grouped based on their expression across the samples using average linkage hierarchical clustering . The dendrogram was then cut using the dynamic height-cutting algorithm of [95] . This identified 4 groups , labelled in the heatmap diagram of Fig 8A . Compared to Fig 7A , these domains provide a clearer distinction between parasites causing severe and uncomplicated malaria . However , the expression levels of these domain clusters were , in general , lower than the levels of the domains identified using the HMMER3 approach of Rask et al . ( Fig 8B ) . This is consistent with the higher level of sequence identity within a domain cluster identified by the hierarchical tree approach . Therefore , fewer sequences per isolate were captured by each domain cluster than were assigned to each domain by the HMMER3 domain models , and the more diverse sequences captured by a HMMER3 model included many that were highly expressed in uncomplicated malaria ( Fig 8B ) . Examining Fig 8A in more detail reiterated elements of the original domain analysis ( Fig 7A and Fig 6 ) and confirmed previous associations between expressed PfEMP1 domains and severe malaria . Two domain clusters similar to DBL\u03b23 were up-regulated in severe disease . Domain transcripts from the DBL\u03b23 clusters were aligned with published DBL\u03b23 sequences [39] using MUSCLE [96] and clustered using FastTree [97] . Notably , the DBL\u03b23 domain 4 from DC4 in the var gene PFD1235w [39] clustered tightly with 2 of the 4 transcripts from the DBL\u03b23s . 2 cluster we identified but none of the 4 transcripts from the DBL\u03b23s . 1 cluster . The turquoise group of domain clusters includes a cluster with sequences similar to DBL\u03b212 domains . These DBL\u03b212 sequences were compared with domains from DC8 but formed a separate cluster to the 2 clusters formed by the DBL\u03b212 domains found in DC8 [14] ( S2 Text ) . The turquoise group of domain clusters in Fig 8A also contained the domain cluster DBL\u03b41 . s . 4 , which did cluster closely with 2 DC8 DBL\u03b41 domains , although DC8 DBL\u03b41 domains cannot be differentiated from other DBL\u03b41 domains . Nonetheless , the clustering by expression profile of DBL\u03b41 . s . 4 and DBL\u03b212 . s . 1 ( turquoise group in Fig 8A ) suggests that these domains could be part of a single DC8-like var in these patients . Unlike all the other analyses employed in this study , the hierarchical approach did not associate up-regulated CIDR\u03b11 sequences with severe malaria . This is presumably a consequence of the low conservation of the CIDR\u03b11 sequences [35] that would not be grouped at the minimum 50% identity threshold employed in the hierarchical analysis . All alignments and trees made with published sequences described above are further described in S2 Text and are available in the Github repository https://github . com/gtonkinhill/falciparum_transcriptome_manuscript . Fig 8A also identifies domain clusters that have not been previously associated with severe disease . These included DBL\u03b33 . s . 1 and DBL\u03b64 . s . 1 from the pink group of domain clusters in Fig 8A . Four of the 5 DBL\u03b33 and 11 of the 12 DBL\u03b64 sequences previously described were found in tandem in DC9 [14] . These domain clusters were among the most abundant up-regulated in severe malaria ( Fig 8B ) and were also up-regulated in the combined transcript assembly ( Fig 6 ) , although not as a single transcript , so there is no direct evidence that DC9 itself is associated with severe malaria . DBL\u03b53 was also amongst the most abundant domain clusters up-regulated in severe malaria in this analysis ( Fig 8B ) . DBL\u03b53 was also up-regulated in every analysis we performed ( Fig 6 ) and was part of DC11 in the separate assembly transcript Corset analysis , although the DC11 transcripts were all different from the up-regulated DBL\u03b53 transcripts from the individual domain analysis . A cluster similar to DBL\u03b5pam5 from the pregnancy malaria-associated gene var2csa was also up-regulated . DBL\u03b41-CIDR\u03b21/2/3/5/7 are common arrangements and were up-regulated in severe malaria in both the combined assembly and the Corset analysis of separately assembled transcripts . These domain subclasses are highly variable and thus difficult to distinguish using the previous classifications of [14] . However , the hierarchical approach identified the CIDR\u03b21 . s . 1 domain cluster that includes a number of identical domain sequences from different isolates . This finding differs from the high variability noted in previous studies [14] . A single CIDR\u03b21 from a gene containing DC8 formed a phylogenetic cluster with the conserved severe malaria\u2013associated CIDR\u03b21 sequence , but CIDR\u03b21 from other DC8 genes did not ( S2 Text ) . The DBL\u03b41 . s . 1 and DBL\u03b41 . s . 2 domain clusters did not form phylogenetic clusters with DBL\u03b41 sequences from DC8 genes ( S2 Text ) but did cluster by expression profile with the uniquely conserved CIDR\u03b21 . s . 1 ( purple group Fig 8A ) and with the non\u2013DC4-like DBL\u03b23 . s . 1 , suggesting the existence of var genes that carry a unique pathogenic arrangement of domains , including a highly conserved CIDR\u03b21 sequence . These 4 domains were not the most abundantly expressed in severe malaria but did discriminate strongly between severe and uncomplicated malaria , suggesting that they were strongly associated with severe malaria in a subset of cases ( Fig 8A , Fig 8B ) . Images of the hierarchical trees that make up each of these newly identified domain clusters are provided in the Github repository along with their respective multiple sequence alignments . The sequence of domains associated with severe malaria by RNAseq was confirmed by Sanger sequencing 34 sequences that were cloned from genomic DNA ( gDNA ) of patient samples . These included domains identified by hierarchical analysis ( 13 domains up-regulated and 11 down-regulated in severe malaria ) , HMMER3 analysis ( 9 domains up-regulated in severe malaria ) , or corset analysis ( the CIDR\u03b12 . 6-DBL\u03b28 tandem arrangement up-regulated in severe malaria ) ( S10 Data ) . Every one of these cloned sequences was 100% identical to the cognate sequence assembled from RNAseq . RNAseq quantitation of domains in severe malaria was corroborated by quantitative reverse transcription PCR ( Q-RT-PCR ) of 10 up-regulated and 3 down-regulated domains . Insufficient RNA was available to test all patient samples , so a subset of patients was tested that included several patients for each domain that had high levels of RNAseq expression of that domain . Q-RT-PCR data correlated with RNAseq Reads Per Kilobase of transcript per Million mapped reads ( RPKM ) for 12 of the 13 domains ( Spearman r all greater than 0 . 53 , all p < 0 . 03 ) ( S6 Fig ) . Q-RT-PCR and RNAseq of DBL\u03b53 . s . 1 did not correlate because a number of uncomplicated malaria samples contained high levels of expression by Q-RT-PCR but not by RNAseq . Because Q-RT-PCR works best on small sequences ( in this case a 64 bp product ) and detects hybridisation rather than actual sequence , the most probable explanation for this discordance is cross-reactive amplification of non-DBL\u03b53 . s . 1 by the Q-RT-PCR . Due to the highly variable nature of var genes , it is common to focus on the most conserved segments\u2014or blocks\u2014of var gene sequence [14 , 50] . To investigate these conserved regions , we examined 628 homology blocks that were previously defined [14] . Of these , 613 were available for download from the VARDOM server . An approach was also developed comparable to that of [98] to divide the var sequences into conserved and variable regions . The previously defined Homology blocks [14] were clustered and examined using the same approach as for the previously defined domains [14] . HMMER3 [91] profile hidden Markov models were used to annotate the separate assembly transcripts , and read counts were obtained from the aggregate of these annotations for each block . Overall , 16 homology blocks were identified as being differentially expressed ( S11 Data ) . Ten of these ( homology blocks 47 , 97 , 121 , 126 , 141 , 142 , 150 , 183 , 219 , and 582 ) were up-regulated in severe disease . The heatmap in Fig A in S7 Fig indicates that homology blocks 219 and 582 are the most distinct in their expression profiles . Homology block 219 is located in the DBL\u03b11 domain class found in group A var genes and has previously been associated with severe malaria and rosetting [51] . Block 582 is usually found after a DBL\u03b64 domain in DC9 . DBL\u03b64 domains were found to be up-regulated in severe disease in the domain-level analysis . Homology blocks 126 and 142 are found mainly within DBL\u03b55 but also other DBL\u03b5 subtypes , whilst block 97 is found in DBL\u03b54\u20138 , 12 , 14 , PAM5 and DBL\u03b36 , 12 , 16 , 17 domains . Some of these DBL\u03b5 subtypes were also identified in the domain-level analysis . Blocks 121 and 150 are found in CIDR\u03b11 domains , and homology block 141 is found at the junction between CIDR\u03b11 and DBL\u03b21 , 3 , 7 , 12 domains , whilst block 183 is found in DBL\u03b21 , 3\u20135 , 10\u201312 , domains . As mentioned previously , DBL\u03b23 , DBL\u03b212 , and CIDR\u03b11 domains are associated with DC4 and DC8 , which have been associated with severe disease . Finally , homology block 47 is found within the acidic terminal sequence ( ATS ) of var genes . This region does not code for the extracellular part of the protein . Although differentially expressed blocks are identified , it likely that , as in the domain analysis , a better classification can be made by making use of the novel transcripts . The homology blocks used for this analysis were defined based on conserved recombining regions in the var gene genome [14] and not on their relationship to disease severity . This may have obscured conserved regions that are related to severe disease . Furthermore , by focusing on only the most conserved regions , we are potentially ignoring informative\u2014but more variable\u2014regions . Finally , the homology blocks of [14] were inferred from laboratory strains and may not include conserved segments that are unique to severe disease types . As an alternative , an approach similar to [98] was used to divide up multiple sequence alignments of the major domain classes . Domains identified using HMMER3 [99] were grouped into their major domain classes and aligned using Gismo [100] . Sequence logos of the resulting alignments were generated using skylign [101] ( see S8 Fig ) . Gismo [100] was found to handle the large diversity in the var domains better than other aligners . The resulting alignments were then segmented into regions of high and low occupancy . If 7 or more consecutive columns within an alignment had an occupancy greater than 95% , these columns were considered a conserved region . The columns in between these conserved regions were considered variable regions . Regions of high variability are harder to align and consequently result in more gapped alignments . The results were found to be robust to the choice of the occupancy threshold as well as the choice for the number of consecutive conserved columns . This approach produces interleaved regions of higher conservation and diversity . The approach is similar to that proposed by [98]; however , we focus on both the conserved and variable regions . Each domain sequence was then split into segments based on the regions identified . We refer to these segments by their location within the domain from which they originate . For example , DBL\u03b1_block2 is the second interleaved region of the DBL\u03b1 domain class . The segments were then hierarchically clustered within their respective regions and analysed for differential expression in a similar manner to that used for the domains . Due to the short nature of these segments , CD-HIT [102] was used in place of USEARCH [93] because it accounts for the terminal gaps in its definition of pairwise sequence identity . Aside from identifying segments associated with severe disease , an advantage of this approach is that the resulting segments can easily be understood in terms of their relationship to the var domains and gene sequence . DESeq2 [86] was used to investigate the differential expression of the segments , and Benjamini-Yekutieli [94] correction was used to correct for the multiple dependent tests . Overall , 26 clusters of segments were identified as being differentially expressed , of which 21 were up-regulated in severe disease ( S12 Data ) . Fig 9 indicates the expression levels for each segment cluster across the samples . One lies in segment 4 of the NTSA region and 3 in regions 1 , 5 , and 6 of the DBL\u03b11 domain class of group A var genes . A single up-regulated cluster ( 170183_0 . 9 DBL\u03b1_block5 ) lies in segment 5 of DBL\u03b10 . 1 from non\u2013group A var genes . A cluster from region 6 of the CIDR\u03b1 domain class had a similar expression profile to those segment clusters from the DBL\u03b1 domain class . The cluster was also mostly made up of segments from CIDR\u03b11 . 4 and 1 . 8 domains that have been associated with severe disease [32\u201334 , 46 , 49] . Two DBL\u03b5 segment clusters from regions 6 and 8 derived primarily from DBL\u03b55 subtypes also had similar expression profiles to the DBL\u03b1 segment clusters . Furthermore , the clusters from region 6 of the DBL\u03b5 domain often appear in conjunction with homology blocks 126 and 142 , suggesting they are identifying similar domains . The DBL\u03b55 subtype has only been described in var1 . A striking difference in expression profile was observed between the moderately high levels of expression in both uncomplicated and severe malaria samples of the grouping of clusters from NTSA , DBL\u03b11 , CIDR\u03b11 , and the DBL\u03b5 region 6 and 8 compared to the markedly lower levels of expression in the uncomplicated samples of all other segment clusters that were up-regulated in the severe samples ( Fig 9 ) . This is consistent with the presence of NTSA and DBL\u03b11 on all group A var genes and therefore their expression in both uncomplicated and severe malaria . Similarly , var1 is ubiquitously expressed by laboratory isolates and is not subject to the same program of gene regulation as other var genes , and so might be expected to be expressed in both uncomplicated and severe malaria . However , these data also suggest that expression of CIDR\u03b11 that can bind EPCR does not distinguish between severe and uncomplicated malaria as well as other var regions , which presumably mediate adhesion to other receptors . The relationships between the segments , homology blocks , domains , and transcripts are illustrated in Fig 6 . The Clusters from region 2 of DBL\u03b3 and regions 12 and 15 of DBL\u03b6 contained 15 transcripts , including 13 from the domain clusters DBL\u03b33 . s . 1 and DBL\u03b64 . s . 1 , suggesting that we have identified similar disease-associated sequences at both the domain and segment level . Five of the transcripts included region 2 of DBL\u03b3 and both or either of regions 12 and 15 of DBL\u03b6 and 5 of the transcripts included regions 4 of CIDR\u03b3 and/or region 11 of the DBL\u03b4 . DBL\u03b4-CIDR\u03b3 tandem domains invariably precede the DBL\u03b3-DBL\u03b6 tandem domains of DC9 . Seven of the 11 transcripts containing regions 12 and 15 of the DBL\u03b6 domain class also contained published homology block 582 [14] , indicating they may be detecting similar signals ( S5 Data ) . Significant clusters from regions 1 and 3 of the DBL\u03b5 domain class often appear in both of the previously identified domain clusters DBL\u03b52 . s . 1 and DBL\u03b59 . s . 1 as well as a number of other DBL\u03b59 domain sequences . As the segment clusters collapse , 2 previous domain clusters along with a number of other sequences; this indicates that these segments may have better captured the sequence elements associated with severe disease . Due to the high diversity of the DBL\u03b5 domain class at the domain level , it is hard to accurately define which sequences are associated with severe disease , and consequently this highlights the virtue of investigating these sequences at multiple resolutions . Eight out of 11 clustered DBL\u03b2 region 4 sequences are also part of the DBL\u03b212 domain class . In 4 occurrences , it appears in a transcript that includes DC8 . Two of the 10 DC4 transcripts clustered by Corset also contained DBL\u03b2 region 4 sequences that were part of DBL\u03b23 . Therefore , the up-regulated DBL\u03b2 region 4 sequence collapses 2 DBL\u03b2 subtypes that are independently associated with severe malaria and implicated in different adhesion phenotypes . Five of the 13 transcripts from the cluster containing DBL\u03b2 region 8 also contained the DC4-like homology block 141 , whilst 2 of the 8 transcripts from the cluster containing region 5 of DBL\u03b2 also contain the non\u2013DC4-like DBL\u03b23 . s . 1 domain . Transcripts from clusters of regions 5 and 7 of the DBL\u03b3 domain class don\u2019t appear with other segments significantly associated with severe malaria , with the exception of 2 region 7 segments that appear in transcripts that include DC6 . These segments may represent signal lost in the analysis of larger sequence elements . To investigate the utility of using the different feature levels to differentiate severe and nonsevere disease , we fit a logistic regression model with lasso regularisation . A model was generated for each level of the var gene analysis ( transcript , domain , and segment ) using the features found to be up-regulated in severe disease . We made use of crossvalidation to determine the optimal lambda value for the regularisation and to give an indication of how well the features distinguish severe and nonsevere disease . Overall , the segment level provided the best discrimination , with misclassification error of 9 . 76% and 12 . 20% for the homology block and segment clusters , respectively . The misclassification for the domain-level analysis was 21 . 95% when using either the Rask et al . domains or the hierarchically clustered domains as features . Notably , by making use of the domains defined using the novel hierarchical approach , fewer features were required to achieve a similar classification accuracy . Distinguishing between phenotypes using a smaller number of features is important when investigating possible targets for vaccines . The transcript-level features provided the least discrimination , giving misclassification errors of 31 . 71% and 43 . 90% for the combined assembly transcripts and transcript clusters , respectively . It should be noted that these classification rates cannot be generalised to new samples because the cross validation was used to determine the lambda value as well as the misclassification rates . The code for this regression analysis is available in the Github repository . The relationship between the segments , domains , and transcripts discussed is available in S5 Data and Fig 6 . Tree diagrams , like those produced for the domains , are available for each significant segment cluster in the Github repository . \n Transcriptional profiling of parasites isolated from patients with severe malaria indicated a shift towards a less glycolytic phenotype . Previous studies have also reported decreases in glycolytic transcripts in some clinical isolates [6] , including those from patients with higher temperatures [8] as well as in parasites cultivated in vitro at a high density that inhibits subsequent growth [103] . Down-regulation of genes encoding key enzymes in folate and pyrimidine biosynthesis is also consistent with decreased nucleotide production and reduced parasite growth . The down-regulation of genes involved in histone methylation was similar to deregulation of genes involved in chromatin and RNA biology that was observed in clinical isolates from patients with an elevated surrogate measure of parasitaemia [8] . Our data suggest that parasites causing severe malaria have a more metabolically quiescent phenotype than parasites causing uncomplicated malaria . It remains to be determined whether parasites with the severe malaria transcriptional profile are more resilient and therefore able to cause severe malaria , or whether the host environment in either severe malaria or uncomplicated malaria could have selected or elicited the differing transcriptional profiles . Modulation of parasite growth in response to host environment might be consistent with previous reports of P . falciparum density sensing in malaria [103\u2013105] and protracted maturation of P . berghei and P . yoelli in response to an acute host immune response [106] . In the latter study , more mature , circulating P . berghei and P . yoelli were detected in semi-immune than naive mice . This was consistent with our observation that the circulating parasites were older in the uncomplicated than the severe malaria patients because we previously showed that the uncomplicated malaria patients had more immunity to PfEMP1 than the severe malaria patients [88] . The parasites causing severe malaria had also down-regulated genes involved in PfEMP1 surface expression . This differed from the reported increased expression of genes encoding exported proteins involved in PfEMP1 surface expression in severe malaria from a posthoc comparison [107] of separately published transcriptomes of parasites causing severe [7] and uncomplicated [58] malaria . This difference probably relates to the difficulty of posthoc inference of differential gene expression when the compared samples are from different populations and different studies and were analysed using different microarrays . None of the 87 genes identified in up-regulated gene sets by Pelle et al . were up-regulated in severe malaria in the current study; however , 17 of these genes were down-regulated , including skeleton-binding protein 1 , which was the only gene directly involved in PfEMP1 surface expression identified by Pelle et al . We previously showed that the severe malaria patients in the current study had antibodies to PfEMP1 that were generally present at lower levels and that recognised fewer PfEMP1s than the antibodies from the uncomplicated malaria patients [88] . This suggests that humoral immunity to PfEMP1 did not select for decreased PfEMP1 surface expression in the parasites causing severe malaria . However , loss or decrease of many of the proteins involved in PfEMP1 surface expression causes decreased cytoadherence [76 , 108 , 109] , so the parasites infecting patients with severe malaria at the time of sampling might have had a decreased cytoadherent capacity . The unique var transcriptional profile we describe in severe malaria recapitulates all of the previously described associations as well as uncovering multiple , novel sequence associations . These findings are remarkable considering that all of the associations that have been observed previously in children with severe malaria from multiple sites across Africa were found in 23 adults with severe malaria from Papua . This suggests that the same conserved var genes are associated with severe disease in nonimmune individuals regardless of geography or patients\u2019 age . Furthermore , a consistent pattern of expression of restricted subsets of var genes , domains , and/or segments was observed despite heterogeneous presentations of severe disease . Similarly , the severe malaria non-var transcriptome clusters also did not segregate by specific severe malaria syndromes . These observations suggest that common mechanisms of disease may cause the varied syndromes of severe malaria . This could have therapeutic implications , although the analyses should be confirmed with larger sample sets . These findings emphasise the strength of the association between severe malaria and DC8 , DC4 , DC6 CIDR\u03b11 , DBL\u03b23 , and DBL\u03b212 sequences , which were each shown to be up-regulated in multiple analyses of the de novo var assemblies . However , they also uncover significant , novel associations with other var sequences at the transcript , domain , and segment level . Some of these were found at multiple levels of analysis , e . g . , DC11 , CIDR\u03b12 . 6-DBL\u03b28 , DBL\u03b53 , DBL\u03b33 , DBL\u03b64 , and DBL\u03b52/9 , and in the individual domain analysis , the latter 4 domains were expressed at least as highly in severe malaria as the EPCR-binding CIDR\u03b11 sequences . We cannot exclude the possibility that some of these domains were present on the same PfEMP1 as a CIDR\u03b11 sequence; however , CIDR\u03b11 was not present on the significantly up-regulated transcripts that carried these other domains in either the combined assembly or the corset analysis of the individual isolate var assemblies . We developed a novel analytical approach testing sequences for associations with disease at multiple levels of sequence homology . This revealed domain subtypes that were strongly associated with disease , including a highly conserved CIDR\u03b21 subtype and a DBL\u03b41 subtype that clustered in the same patients . The diversity of the parent CIDR\u03b21 and DBL\u03b41 subtypes prevented detection of an association using the established subtype classifications . Finally , we revealed striking associations between smaller var sequence segments and severe disease again by testing for associations at multiple levels of sequence identity . These small segments were limited in number , and many of the findings recapitulated our domain analysis . Some of these segments collapsed multiple domain subtypes , e . g . , DBL\u03b2_block4 collapsed DBL\u03b23 and DBL\u03b212 , raising the possibility that a single segment may elicit cross-reactive immunity against different domain subtypes that are independently associated with severe disease . These segments may help identify critical , fine-scale details of the var sequences expressed by parasites that cause disease and may be of great utility in designing vaccines for severe malaria . The association of these sequences with severe malaria should be validated in other populations from across the world and the encoded proteins tested for adhesion phenotype and for seroreactivity consistent with protection from severe malaria . \n Written , informed consent was provided by all participants . The study was approved in Indonesia by the Eijkman Institute Research Ethics Commission ( project number 46 ) , in Australia by the Melbourne Health Human Research Ethics Committee ( project number 2010 . 284 ) and Human Research Ethics Committee of the NT Department of Health & Families and Menzies School of Health Research , Darwin , Australia ( HREC 2010\u20131396 ) . The data sets generated and/or analysed during the current study are available in the Arrayexpress repository accession: E-MTAB-5860 ( sequenced libraries for each sample ) and the ENA repository accession: PRJEB20632 ( de novo var gene assemblies for combined and individual samples ) . Venous samples were collected from patients with severe ( n = 23 ) and uncomplicated ( n = 21 ) malaria attending a healthcare facility in Timika , Papua Province , Indonesia . This area has unstable malaria transmission , with estimated annual parasite incidence of 450 per 1 , 000 population and symptomatic illness in all ages [110] . Severe malaria was defined as peripheral parasitaemia with at least one modified World Health Organization ( WHO ) criterion of severity [111] . All of the 23 patients with severe malaria had parasitemias greater than 1 , 000 per \u03bcL , which is a previously derived threshold that predicts clinical disease in northern Papua [49] . Therefore , incidental parasitaemia is unlikely in these severe malaria patients . White blood cells were depleted from the blood by retention on CF11 cellulose ( Whatman-no longer available ) using a modification of a previously described protocol [112] ( S1 Text Supplementary methods ) . RNA was extracted from erythrocytes in TRIzol using a modified RNeasy mini ( QIAGEN , Hilden , Germany ) protocol ( S1 Text Supplementary methods ) . Purified RNA 1 to 3 \u03bcg was depleted of Hb mRNA using the Globinclear human Hb RNA depletion kit ( Ambion , Thermo Fisher Scientific , Waltham , MA ) and a modified protocol ( S1 Text supplementary methods ) . mRNA was oligo dT purified from the total RNA using the NEBNext Poly ( A ) mRNA magnetic isolation module ( New England Biolabs , Ipswich , MA ) and mRNA fragmented , reverse transcribed , and used for library synthesis using the NEBnext ultra directional RNA library prep kit for Illumina ( New England Biolabs ) as per the manufacturer\u2019s instructions but with modifications ( S1 Text supplementary methods ) , including a high AT tolerant PCR amplification [113] . Libraries were 100 bp paired end sequenced on a 2500-HT Hiseq ( Illumina , San Diego , CA ) using RapidRun chemistry ( Illumina ) . Briefly , de novo assembly of var genes was performed by running the SoapDeNovo-Trans [114] and Cap3 [115] pipeline described in [53] ( Fig C in S2 Fig ) . Non-var reads were first filtered out by removing reads that aligned to the H . sapiens , P . vivax , and non-var P . falciparum reference genomes . The resulting contigs were filtered for contaminants and translated into the correct reading frame . A more thorough description of the assembly methods is available in S1 Text . Additionally , the code used to run the pipeline is available on Github at https://github . com/PapenfussLab/assemble_var . Reads were first aligned to the H . sapiens and P . falciparum reference genomes using Subread-align v1 . 4 . 6 [97] with parameters -u -H . FeatureCounts v1 . 20 . 2 [116] was used to obtain read counts for each gene . To account for parasite life cycle , each sample is estimated as a mixture of 6 parasite life cycle stages from [57] , excluding the ookinete stage . We aimed to choose the proportions \u03c0 for each sample to minimise \u2211i=1N ( gi , sample\u2212\u2211s\u2208S\u03c0sgi , s ) 2 subject to the constraints \u2211s\u2208S\u03c0s=1 And \u03c0s\u22650 such that gi , s represents the expression of the ith gene in stage s of the [57] data . Three factors of unwanted variation were estimated using the RUV4 function from the R package ruv v0 . 9 . 6 [117] using the 1 , 009 genes with the lowest p-values from [118] as controls . The choice of control genes was compared to using the least differentially expressed genes of [8] , which was found to give similar results . Finally , the gene counts along with the estimated ring-stage factor , and 3 factors of unwanted variation estimated by RUV4 were fed into the Limma/Voom [55 , 56] differential analysis pipeline . For a detailed outline of the specific commands run in the all-gene analysis , see S1 Text and rmarkdown S1 Text available in the Github repository https://github . com/gtonkinhill/falciparum_transcriptome_manuscript . For all levels of var expression analysis , library size was normalised using the median ratio method [119] in the default DESeq2 pipeline [86] . Differential expression analysis at the var transcript level was performed using 2 distinct approaches . The first made use of the separately assembled transcripts by first aligning reads to the transcripts allowing for multiple mapping using Bowtie v0 . 12 . 9 [120] . The transcripts were then clustered using Corset v1 . 03 [89] . The resulting cluster read counts were analysed using the default DESeq2 pipeline [86] . An alternative strategy made use of the combined assembly transcripts . Reads were aligned and transcript level counts obtained using Subread and Featurecounts , respectively , before analysing differential expression using DESeq2 . Rmarkdown texts S2 and S3 in the Github repository provide a more thorough description of this analysis along with the code https://github . com/gtonkinhill/falciparum_transcriptome_manuscript . HMMER3\u2019s hmmsearch v3 . 1b1 [91] was used to search the NTS , DBL , and CIDR domain models of [14] against the assembled transcripts from each sample . The most significant domain was annotated first and then successively less significant domains , with the requirement that 2 domains do not overlap . An E-value threshold of 1e-8 was chosen to minimise spurious annotations . FeatureCounts was used to allocate reads to domains using a SAF file built from the HMMER3 annotations . The resulting counts were then aggregated using the previous domain classification of [14] as well as a novel hierarchical approach . The annotated domains were hierarchically clustered using USEARCH [93] by first clustering by length and then by successively lower identity thresholds . The read counts for each domain are then aggregated up this hierarchical tree , and the default DESeq2 pipeline was used to identify differentially expressed nodes . After multiple testing correction [94] , we iteratively reject the null hypothesis ( p < 0 . 05 ) of the most significant node in the hierarchy before removing its ancestor and children nodes . This ensures that we select the most significant grouping of domains from which to form clusters . DESeq2 was also run on the domains aggregated using the previous classification .", "headings": ["Abstract", "Introduction", "Results", "Discussion", "Materials and methods"], "keywords": ["sequencing techniques", "medicine and health sciences", "parasite groups", "methods and resources", "plasmodium", "tropical diseases", "parasitic diseases", "parasitic protozoans", "sequence assembly tools", "parasitology", "apicomplexa", "protozoans", "genome analysis", "molecular biology techniques", "rna sequencing", "research and analysis methods", "sequence analysis", "genomics", "malarial parasites", "bioinformatics", "sequence alignment", "gene expression", "molecular biology", "eukaryota", "database and informatics methods", "genetics", "biology and life sciences", "malaria", "computational biology", "organisms"], "id": "journal.pbio.2004328"}
{"lay_summary": "AAV-mediated antibody delivery represents a promising alternative to classical vaccine approaches for the prevention of HIV/AIDS in humans . We used recombinant adeno-associated viral vectors ( rAAV ) as gene carrier to deliver anti-SIV ( simian immunodeficiency virus ) antibodies to monkeys . This non-classical immunization approach is independent of the host immune system and the AAV-transferred gene into muscle cells produces antibodies with known specificities . Our goal was to determine what serum levels of delivered antibodies can be achieved by using two different vector strategies , whether the delivered antibodies provoke an immune response , and to what degree the delivered non-neutralizing antibodies have the ability to protect against SIV virus challenge . This approach allowed for sustained levels of delivered antibodies in serum and exhibited significant protective effects against highly pathogenic SIVmac239 challenge . However , immune responses limited the concentration of circulating antibodies that could be achieved . This problem will need to be understood and overcome for the promise of this approach to be effectively realized .", "article": "Long-term delivery of potent broadly-neutralizing antibodies is a promising approach for the prevention of HIV-1 infection . We used AAV vector intramuscularly to deliver anti-SIV monoclonal antibodies ( mAbs ) in IgG1 form to rhesus monkeys . Persisting levels of delivered mAb as high as 270 \u03bcg/ml were achieved . However , host antibody responses to the delivered antibody were observed in 9 of the 12 monkeys and these appeared to limit the concentration of delivered antibody that could be achieved . This is reflected in the wide range of delivered mAb concentrations that were achieved: 1\u2013270 \u03bcg/ml . Following repeated , marginal dose , intravenous challenge with the difficult-to-neutralize SIVmac239 , the six monkeys in the AAV-5L7 IgG1 mAb group showed clear protective effects despite the absence of detectable neutralizing activity against the challenge virus . The protective effects included: lowering of viral load at peak height; lowering of viral load at set point; delay in the time to peak viral load from the time of the infectious virus exposure . All of these effects were statistically significant . In addition , the monkey with the highest level of delivered 5L7 mAb completely resisted six successive SIVmac239 i . v . challenges , including a final challenge with a dose of 10 i . v . infectious units . Our results demonstrate the continued promise of this approach for the prevention of HIV-1 infection in people . However , the problem of anti-antibody responses will need to be understood and overcome for the promise of this approach to be effectively realized . \n There are good reasons for believing that development of an effective preventive vaccine against HIV-1 is going to be a very difficult task . HIV-1 has evolved a variety of immune evasion strategies that allow continuous virus replication in the face of apparently strong host immune responses , both cellular and humoral [1 , 2] . For a vaccine to be effective it will likely need to either completely block the initial infection or to provide immune responses that are more effective than those resulting from infection . One promising , creative approach is to use adeno-associated virus ( AAV ) vector to deliver antibodies with potent and broadly neutralizing activity [3\u20137] . This method is an alternative to classical immunization and independent of the host immune system . Proteins delivered by AAV vector can persist at stable levels for years [8 , 9] , and AAV vectors have proven to be safe and effective in human gene therapy trials against a number of diseases [10\u201313] . More than a dozen potent broadly neutralizing anti-HIV-1 monoclonal antibodies have already been characterized; they are human-derived , they can effectively neutralize more than 90% of circulating HIV-1 strains , and they represent a range of different specificities [14\u201321] . In a previous pioneering study performed in monkeys , anti-SIV immunoadhesins ( antibody-like molecules ) were delivered by AAV vector and a reasonable percentage of the monkeys exhibited apparent sterilizing immunity against intravenous ( i . v . ) challenge by SIVmac316 [4] . However , SIVmac316 is an easy-to-neutralize SIV strain , one third of the immunized monkeys developed antibody responses ( anti-anti ) to the delivered immunoadhesin , and monkeys with anti-anti responses were not protected against the challenge . It was not clear from that initial study to what extent anti-anti responses may have resulted from delivery of immunoadhesins , which do not represent an authentic IgG structure . We decided to build upon these studies by using AAV to deliver authentic IgG and to examine protection against the difficult-to-neutralize strain SIVmac239 . At the time these studies were initiated , there were no monoclonal antibodies available that could neutralize SIVmac239 . We thus converted the previously reported immunoadhesins 4L6 and 5L7 [4] into authentic IgG versions . These anti-SIV mAbs in IgG1 form contain only authentic rhesus IgG sequences . In this study we describe the AAV-mediated delivery of these full-length immunoglobulins to rhesus macaques and the protective effects of the non-neutralizing antibody 5L7 IgG1 against SIVmac239 challenge . \n Two fundamentally different types of AAV systems are available for vector-mediated delivery: single-stranded ( ssAAV ) vs . self-complementary ( scAAV ) [22] . scAAV has been reported to achieve considerably higher levels of transgene expression [23 , 24] but suffers from the drawback of not being able to accommodate sufficient genetic information for the expression of both heavy ( H ) and light ( L ) chains needed for authentic IgG [25] . We thus developed two strategies for AAV-mediated synthesis of authentic IgG for comparison purposes: ssAAV for the synthesis of matched H and L chains from a single vector vs . scAAV for the synthesis of H and L chains from separate vectors , an approach that we will call the two vector approach . The logic behind the two vector approach is that such a high quantity of AAV vector particles is inoculated into a highly localized area of muscle that it seems likely that many , perhaps even a majority , of cells will take up multiple AAV particles . We sought to deliver authentic IgG versions of the previously described monoclonal Fabs 346-16h and 347-23h [26] in order to allow comparison to the results of Johnson et al . that utilized immunoadhesins with these binding specificities ( called 4L6 and 5L7 , respectively ) [4] . Since SIVmac239 was planned for challenge , this also allowed investigation of protective effects in the absence of virus-neutralizing activity . We employed IgG1 sequences in order to maximize antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity ( ADCC ) activity and other effector functions . We used AAV serotype 1 for intramuscular expression . The constructs shown in ( S1 Fig ) were demonstrated to express authentic rhesus IgG with expected properties prior to the initiation of monkey experiments . In our first monkey study , three AAV1-negative monkeys were inoculated intramuscularly with 1 . 6 x 1013 ssAAV vector particles expressing both heavy and light chains of the authentic rhesus monkey IgG1 monoclonal antibody 5L7 ( ssAAV-5L7 IgG1 ) . On the same date , three AAV1-negative monkeys were inoculated with 0 . 8 x 1013 scAAV vector particles expressing 5L7 IgG1 heavy chain and 0 . 8 x 1013 scAAV vector particles expressing 5L7 kappa light chain ( scAAV-5L7 IgG1 H + scAAV-5L7 kappa L ) . The levels of delivered 5L7 mAb in plasma were measured by a gp140 ELISA and purified mAb as standard . Considerable monkey-to-monkey variation was observed in the levels of 5L7 IgG1 that were achieved ( Fig 1A ) . However , the levels in each individual monkey remained stable over the course of months leading up to the time of challenge . There were no clear differences in the persisting levels of 5L7 IgG1 mAb associated with the one vector vs . two vector delivery systems . While monkey 153\u201310 in the one vector group achieved persisting levels of 5L7 IgG1 mAb of only 1\u20135 \u03bcg/ml , monkey 84\u201305 , also in the one vector group , achieved remarkable levels of approximately 270 \u03bcg/ml that have persisted now for more than two years . Three of the six monkeys in this first study had clear antibody responses to the delivered 5L7 IgG1 mAb ( Fig 1C and S2 Fig ) . Monkey 153\u201310 with the lowest level of persisting 5L7 mAb had the strongest anti-anti response , while monkey 84\u201305 with the highest level of persisting 5L7 mAb had no detectable anti-anti response . The other two monkeys without detectable anti-anti responses ( 111\u201309 and 154\u201310 ) were in the two vector scAAV group . In our second monkey study , we used the one vector ssAAV approach to deliver the 4L6 mAb in IgG1 form to six AAV1-negative monkeys . In this experiment , the levels of delivered 4L6 mAb peaked 3\u20134 weeks after administration and then fell precipitously ( Fig 1B ) . All six of the recombinant AAV-4L6 recipients had antibody responses to the delivered 4L6 mAb whose appearance coincided with the precipitous decline in 4L6 mAb levels ( Fig 1D and S3 Fig ) . The anti-anti responses in the 5L7 IgG1 recipients ( Fig 1C ) were largely specific for 5L7 while the anti-anti responses in the 4L6 IgG1 recipients ( Fig 1D ) were largely specific for 4L6; since the 5L7 and 4L6 IgG1s have the exact same constant regions , these results indicate that the responses were mostly directed to the variable domains ( Fig 1E and 1F ) . By week 14 , the time of SIV challenge , the levels of 4L6 mAb in two of the recipients ( 279\u201310 and 283\u201310 ) had dropped to undetectable levels , while the levels in the other four monkeys had dropped to 1\u201338 \u03bcg/ml ( Fig 1B ) . Six appropriately-matched control rhesus monkeys were enrolled in the challenge phase ( S1 Table ) . Repeated , marginal dose , intravenous challenges were simultaneously initiated to control monkeys , to the 5L7 mAb group 44 weeks after their administration of recombinant AAV-5L7 IgG1 , and to the 4L6 mAb group 14 weeks after their administration of recombinant AAV-4L6 IgG1 . Administrations were performed every three weeks such that administrations were stopped when a monkey became infected from the previous exposure . A PBMC-grown stock of cloned SIVmac239 was used , one that has been carefully titered previously by the i . v . route in monkeys and has been used extensively by numerous investigators for controlled dose challenges [27\u201335] . One i . v . animal infectious dose was used through the first four administrations , 2 i . v . infectious doses for the fifth administration , and 10 i . v . infectious doses for the sixth administration . Only one monkey of the 18 resisted all six challenges: monkey 84\u201305 with the highest levels of delivered mAb ( averaging approximately 270 \u03bcg/ml of the 5L7 mAb through all of the challenges ) ( Fig 2A ) . Dozens of control monkeys have been challenged with the 10x dose of this exact same stock in numerous previous studies and not a single monkey has been refractory to infection [27\u201335] . The absence of anti-gp41 antibody responses in 84\u201305 even following the 10x challenge is consistent with the apparent sterilizing immunity in this animal ( S4 Fig ) . Otherwise , no significant difference in the acquisition of SIV infection was observed among the test vs . control monkeys ( Fig 2A ) . Given that levels of delivered 4L6 IgG1 mAb were driven to low or undetectable levels by the time of first challenge in most monkeys in this group , it is not surprising that plasma virion SIV RNA levels in the 4L6 mAb group as a function of weeks following the infectious exposure were not significantly different from control monkeys , neither at peak viremia nor during chronic phase infection ( Fig 2B and 2C; Fig 2E ) . However , SIV plasma RNA loads in the 5L7 mAb group were significantly lower than those in the control group both at peak viremia ( \u0394 of 0 . 67 logs ) and during chronic phase infection ( \u0394 of 2 . 06 logs ) ( Fig 2B and 2C; Fig 2F ) . The differences were significant whether or not the undetectable viral loads of monkey 84\u201305 were included in the analyses . The viral loads in the 5L7 mAb group at set point were also significantly lower than those in the 4L6 mAb group ( Fig 2C ) . The duration in weeks from the time of the infectious exposure to peak plasma viral loads was also significantly different between the 5L7 mAb group and the control group ( Fig 2D ) . While there is a suggestion that viral loads at peak height were inversely correlated with the levels of delivered 5L7 mAb , this correlation did not reach statistical significance ( S5 Fig ) . There was no obvious association of measured 4L6 IgG1 levels in serum at the time of infectious exposure with the time to peak viremia ( S6 Fig ) . Both the 5L7 and the 4L6 mAb IgG1s lack detectable neutralizing activity against the challenge strain SIVmac239 ( Fig 3A ) . In fact , even at 1 mg/ml of the 5L7 mAb IgG1 , 50% neutralization of SIVmac239 was not achieved ( Fig 3B ) . However , both the 5L7 and 4L6 mAbs had neutralizing activity against the neutralization-sensitive derivative of SIVmac239 called SIVmac316 ( Fig 3C ) . The half-maximal inhibitory concentrations ( IC50s ) against SIVmac316 were 0 . 0015 \u03bcg/ml ( 4L6 IgG1 ) and 0 . 003 \u03bcg/ml ( 5L7 IgG1 ) , which are consistent with previously described IC50s for Fab molecule and immunoadhesin versions of these mAbs [4 , 26] . The concentrations of mAb in sera shown in ( Fig 1A ) were measured biochemically with a gp140 ELISA using varying amounts of purified mAb produced by transfection of 293T cells in culture as standards . In order to validate the biochemically measured mAb concentrations and to confirm the expected neutralizing activity in serum against SIVmac316 , serum samples were diluted to contain a starting concentration of 4 \u03bcg/ml 5L7 mAb based on the biochemically-measured concentration and neutralizing activity against SIVmac316 was measured ( Fig 3D ) . The neutralizing activity in serum agreed spot-on with the biochemically-measured concentration of the 5L7 mAb for all six samples . As expected , sera from 84\u201305 lacked detectable neutralizing activity against SIVmac239 ( Fig 3E ) . HEK 293T-expressed purified immunoadhesins and mAbs showed equivalent binding to SIVmac239 gp140 as determined by ELISA ( Fig 3F ) . With this information in hand , we proceeded to measure ADCC activity in pre-challenge serum samples relative to the biochemically measured 5L7 mAb concentrations in them . We used an assay that measures natural killer ( NK ) cell-mediated ADCC activity of mAb or serum independent of neutralization or complement activity [36] . The assay uses a NK cell line that expresses macaque CD16 as effector cell and a CD4+ T cell line that expresses luciferase upon SIV infection as target . 5L7 IgG1 purified from 293T transfection was diluted to match the starting concentration of 5L7 IgG1 in the serum sample to which it was being compared . Serum from 84\u201305 was unusual in that it had markedly higher ADCC activity than the equivalent concentration of purified 5L7 IgG1 ( Fig 4A and 4B ) . Pre-AAV serum from 84\u201305 contained no measurable activity capable of enhancing the ADCC activity of purified 5L7 IgG1 ( S7 Fig ) . Four of the five remaining animals in the group had ADCC activity in their serum samples comparable to that of purified 5L7 IgG1 at equivalent concentrations ( Fig 4A and 4B; S8 Fig ) . Serum from monkey 111\u201309 , the monkey with the lowest post-challenge viremia , also had somewhat higher ADCC activity compared to purified 5L7 IgG1 at equivalent concentrations ( S8 Fig ) . \n Given the current availability of a spectacular array of human mAbs with potent broadly-neutralizing activity against HIV-1 , it has become possible to envision prevention scenarios in which cocktails of such antibodies could be used to provide a sterilizing barrier to infection against the vast majority of HIV-1 strains circulating in the population . However , it is not practically feasible to consider passive delivery of purified mAbs over a period of years for prevention purposes . AAV vectors are ideally suited for this purpose . The only protein expressed from AAV vectors is derived from the inserted transgene put into it . As long as the protein is viewed as self , protein expression can continue for prolonged periods . In fact , there are already examples where proteins delivered by AAV vector have persisted at stable levels for years [4 , 8 , 9 , 37] , including animal 84\u201305 in our study . Since muscle cells exhibit little or no turnover , they are a preferred source for long-term delivery purposes . Little or no integration of AAV vector DNA into host genome sequences has been observed [38\u201340] and AAV vectors have proven safe when used in clinical settings to reverse hereditary absence of gene function [10\u201313] . The molecularly cloned SIVmac239 is a difficult-to-neutralize strain with many of the characteristics of a primary isolate . It has been extensively used as a challenge strain to gauge efficacy of vaccine approaches in monkeys , and it has generally proven quite difficult to achieve protection against [29 , 30 , 41\u201343] . Being a molecular clone , it avoids complications of interpretation that may arise when a heterogeneous mixture of sequences in an uncloned virus stock are used and when differences in neutralization sensitivity/resistance may exist within the mixture [44 , 45] . The presence of AAV-delivered 5L7 mAb in our experiments significantly delayed the time to peak viral loads and significantly lowered SIVmac239 viral loads both at peak viremia and at viral load set point . The lowering of viral load set points in the 5L7 mAb group was also significantly different from the 4L6 mAb group , lending additional support to the significance of the protective effects . It is also likely that the lack of SIVmac239 acquisition in monkey 84\u201305 is also a real effect of the high concentration of 5L7 mAb in this animal . The 10x ( 6th ) challenge of this monkey utilized the same dose of the same stock that has been used previously in dozens of control monkeys without a failure of infection acquisition [27\u201335] . The protective effects in the 5L7 mAb group occurred in the absence of any detectable neutralizing activity of the 5L7 mAb against the SIVmac239 molecular clone even out to 1 mg/ml . To our knowledge , this is the first demonstration of significant protective effects of a mAb in the absence of an ability to neutralize the challenge virus [46 , 47] . Recent studies have emphasized the importance of Fc-mediated effector functions in contributing to the protection afforded by mAbs capable of neutralizing the SHIV used for challenge [48\u201352] . These studies modulated the Fc-mediated effector functions of a neutralizing mAb up or down in order to examine the effects on protective capacity . Some vaccine studies have also found associations of ADCC activity with protective efficacy [53\u201357] . Effector functions potentially contributing to the protective effects of the 5L7 IgG1 observed in our current study include but are not limited to ADCC activity and complement-mediated virolysis . Along these lines , it is fascinating that the 5L7 mAb circulating in monkey 84\u201305 was not only present at extraordinarily high levels , it had extraordinarily high ADCC activity on a per \u03bcg basis . Because of the nature of the ADCC assay that was used , it seems likely that the extraordinarily high ADCC activity in the serum of this one animal results from differences in post-translational modifications of the 5L7 mAb . Decreased core fucosylation or terminal sialylation have been shown to dramatically increase Fc-mediated ADCC activity [58\u201362] . One question addressed in our current studies was whether the anti-anti responses to the immunoadhesin constructs observed in Johnson et al . [4] could be avoided by delivery of authentic IgG . The answer is a clear no . Immune responses to the delivered IgG1 antibody described here were readily detected in 9 of the 12 test monkeys and these appeared to limit the levels of delivered antibody that could be achieved . This is especially true of the 4L6 group in which the levels of delivered 4L6 IgG1 mAb dropped precipitously coincident with the appearance of the anti-anti responses . In separate studies , we have observed strong antibody responses in rhesus monkeys to AAV-delivered , rhesusized anti-HIV-1 mAbs in 24 of 24 opportunities using a ssAAV1 vector design identical to the one used for the studies described here . This contrasts strikingly with studies in humans in which 13 sequential administrations of 1g of anti-HIV mAb failed to elicit anti-anti responses to the three different antibodies that were used in each of the 12 test subjects [63 , 64] . With our 5L7 and 4L6 experiments , it is possible that a lack of natural pairing of IgG heavy and light chains contributed to their immunogenicity . With our anti-HIV experiments referred to above , it is possible that the failure to rhesusize the variable regions contributed to their immunogenicity . Nonetheless , our results serve as a warning signal for the potential of immunogenicity problems when AAV is used to deliver anti-HIV mAbs in human trials . \n Coding sequences ( heavy chain , light chain or bicistronic ) were designed in silico , codon-optimized and gene-synthesized ( Genscript ) . 4L6 and 5L7 immunoadhesin sequences[4] served as a template and full-length antibodies were constructed by adding CH1 domain and CL domain of rhesus IgG to the already known immunoadhesin sequences . 4L6 and 5L7 sequences originate from recombinant anti-SIV Fab sequences derived from the bone marrow of SIV-infected rhesus monkeys[26] . Amino acid sequence alignments of 4L6 and 5L7 variable regions to the most closely corresponding rhesus genomic regions are depicted in ( S9 Fig ) . Rhesus IgG1 sequence is based on accession no . AAF14058 and AAQ57555 , and rhesus IgG2 sequence is based on AAF14060 and AAQ57567 . Rhesus kappa light chain was designed using CL domain sequence from AAD02577 . Synthesized fragments were then cloned into NotI site of scAAV or ssAAV vector plasmids[4] . Both 4L6 and 5L7 recognize gp120 and gp140 forms of the envelope glycoprotein . HEK293T cells ( ATCC ) were transfected with rAAV vector plasmids and proteins were purified from cell culture supernatant using Protein A Plus ( Pierce ) . Concentration of purified proteins was determined by NanoDrop ( Thermo Scientific ) A280 measurement and purity and integrity was verified by Coomassie staining ( Life Technologies ) . Immunoadhesins and mAbs were tested for their ability to bind SIVmac239 envelope glycoprotein by ELISA . Test plates were coated with recombinant gp140 of SIVmac239 ( Immune Technology ) for 1 h at 37\u00b0C . Plates were washed using PBS-Tween20 ( Sigma-Aldrich ) and subsequently blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in PBS ( Bio-Rad ) . Immunoadhesins , mAbs , positive and negative sera from macaques were serially diluted 1:3 in blocking buffer and added to the test plate . After 1 h of incubation at 37\u00b0C the plates were washed again and a HRP-conjugated goat anti-rhesus IgG H+L ( SouthernBiotech ) was then added for detection . The reaction was stopped after 1 h at 37\u00b0C and plates were washed 10 times . Subsequently , TMB substrate and stop solutions ( SouthernBiotech ) were added and Absorbance at 450 nm was measured in a microplate reader ( PerkinElmer ) . Neutralization activity of mAbs against tested SIV strains was measured by either a luciferase-based assay as described previously ( TZMbl ) [36] or an assay that is based on secreted alkaline phosphatase ( SEAP ) [36] . Virus and a serial dilution of Abs or serum were incubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C before adding it to the TZMbl or SEAP cells ( ATCC ) . Neutralization was assessed two days later by measuring luminescence in a 96-well plate reader ( Perkin Elmer ) . Measurement of antibody effector function was performed by NK cell activity towards virus-infected target cells expressing luciferase[36] . A CD4+ , CCR5+ T-cell line was infected with SIV four days prior assay readout . These target cells were washed three times on the day of the assay and co-cultured with a NK cell line expressing rhesus CD16 and a serial dilution of mAb or heat-inactivated serum for 8 to 10 hours . Cells were lysed afterwards and ADCC was measured as the loss of luciferase activity in the cell culture supernatant . Production of rAAV was conducted as described previously[65] . In short , HEK 293 cells were transfected with rAAV vector plasmid and two helper plasmids to allow generation of infectious AAV particles . After harvesting transfected cells and cell culture supernatant , rAAV was purified by three sequential CsCl centrifugation steps . Vector genome number was assessed by Real-Time PCR , and the purity of the preparation was verified by electron microscopy and silver-stained SDS-PAGE . The animals in our study were rhesus macaques of Indian-origin ( Macaca mulatta ) . We purchased the 18 monkeys and housed them at the New England Primate Research Center of Harvard Medical School in a biocontainment facility in accordance with standards of the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care and the Harvard Medical School Animal Care and Use Committee . The animal samples used here were collected under experimental protocols approved by the Harvard Medical Area Standing Committee on Animals , and conducted in accordance to the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals . All macaques were tested negative for the presence of antibodies to SIV and AAV1 capsid prior AAV administration . The weights of the animals ranged from 2 . 5 kg to 17 . 2 kg at the time of immunization . The six 5L7 IgG1 animals were split in two groups and each animal received a total of 1 . 6 x 1013 AAV vector genomes . One group received 1 . 6 x 1013 particles of ssAAV expressing the heavy and light chains of 5L7 IgG1 , the other group received 0 . 8 x 1013 particles of scAAV expressing the heavy chain of 5L7 IgG1 plus 0 . 8 x 1013 particles of the scAAV expressing the kappa light chain of 5L7 IgG1 . AAV administration was conducted by four equal and deep intramuscular injections , where each animal received two separate 0 . 5 ml injections into both quadriceps . All 6 animals that received 4L6 IgG1 were given a total of 2 . 5 x 1013 AAV vector genomes per monkey . The animal management program of Harvard Medical School is accredited by the American Association for the Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care , and meets National Institutes of Health standards as set forth in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals ( DHHS Publication No . ( NIH ) 85-23 Revised 1985 ) . The Institute also accepts as mandatory the PHS Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals by Awardee Institutions and NIH Principles for the Utilization and Care of Vertebrate Animals Used in Testing , Research , and Training . There is on file with the Office for Protection from Research Risks an approved Assurance of Compliance . Animal facilities were administrated by the state and met Harvard standards for humane care and use of animals through a program of veterinary care , inspection and oversight . Animal care and welfare is the charge of the Committee on Animals , appointed by the Dean , consisting of 22 members comprising 4 veterinarians , 2 public representatives , and 16 doctoral level representatives of principal sites of animal use by Harvard Faculty . Additionally , local facilities are guided and monitored in daily activities by 8 departmental animal use committees . The procedure to avoid unnecessary discomfort , pain , or injury to animals are those prescribed in the aforementioned NIH \u201cGuide\u201d and additional detailed protocols for anesthesia , analgesia , tranquilization , euthanasia , or restraint have been developed and circulated by the Committee on Animals . Rhesus macaques on study were housed in the biocontainment facility of the New England Primate Research Center of Harvard Medical School under approved protocol 04655 of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee ( IACUC ) of Harvard Medical School . The Harvard Office of Microbiological Safety oversaw the design and construction of this facility . It includes individual Hepa-filtered caging for monkeys and additional features such as a pass-through autoclave , footpedal-operated sink , and a special safety cabinet for surgical and necropsy procedures . The facility has restricted access . Individuals entering the room must suit-up with disposable cap , mask , coverall , gloves and shoe covers . Procedures used in the care and feeding of these animals are posted on the entry door . The animals were provided ad lib access to municipal source water , offered commercial monkey chow twice daily , and offered fresh produce a minimum of three times weekly . Light cycle was controlled at 12/12 hours daily . Containment facilities and procedures for macaques experimentally infected with RRV and SIV have been reviewed and approved by the Harvard Committee on Microbiological Safety . Animals housed in the biocontainment facilities received a daily health check by both animal care technicians and veterinary professional staff . All animals received a complete physical examination on the average of once every four to six weeks . A comprehensive environmental enrichment and psychological well-being plan was in place for primates in the described studies and is available for inspection by the United States Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service ( APHIS ) and to officials of any pertinent organization . Euthanasia took place at defined experimental endpoints using protocols consistent with the American Veterinary Medical Association ( AVMA ) guidelines . Animals were first sedated with intramuscular ketamine hydrochloride at 20 mg/kg body followed by sodium pentobarbital ( \u2265100 mg/kg ) intravenously to achieve euthanasia . To measure the concentration of 5L7 IgG1 and 4L6 IgG1 in vivo we performed a SIVmac239 gp140 ( Immune Tech ) /anti-rhesus IgG ELISA ( Southern Biotech ) . Absorbance at 450 nm was compared to a serial dilution of purified mAb produced in HEK 293T cells , and the amount of antibody in serum was extrapolated based on the mAb standard curve . Reference protein was quantified by NanoDrop ( Thermo Scientific ) A280 measurement and purity was verified by Coomassie staining ( Life Technologies ) . Levels of AAV-delivered antibody were measured up to the time of SIV challenge: 44 weeks ( 5L7 IgG1 ) and 14 weeks ( 4L6 IgG1 ) after AAV administration . The appearance of anti-env antibody responses following SIV infection obviated our ability to measure levels of delivered mAb at post-infection time points . Humoral responses to the AAV-delivered mAb were measured by an antibody capture ELISA . Plates were coated with purified 5L7 IgG1 and 4L6 IgG1 . After coating and blocking , we incubated the plates with antisera from the AAV-immunized monkeys . For detection , we probed with a HRP-conjugated anti-human lambda light chain antibody ( Southern Biotech ) . This secondary antibody did not cross-react with the coated mAb on the plates since 5L7 IgG1 and 4L6 IgG1 harbor a kappa light chain . For detecting kappa anti-anti responses we produced recombinant versions of mAb that harbor a lambda light chain and detected kappa chain anti-mAb antibodies by probing with a HRP-conjugated anti-human kappa light chain antibody ( Southern Biotech ) . To assess the target of the anti-anti response we tested the reactivity of antisera against AAV-delivered mAb and its immunoadhesin version as well as against antibody or immunoadhesin that was not given to one group of animals . For example , reactivity of antisera from 5L7 IgG1 recipient was tested against purified 5L7 IgG1 , 5L7 immunoadhesin , 4L6 IgG1 and 4L6 immunoadhesin . Infectious SIVmac239 was produced in PBMCs as described previously [27] . SIV challenges were conducted by repeated low dose intravenous injection with SIVmac239 . The challenge dose was 1x AID50 for the first four injection and was elevated to 2x AID50 and 10x AID50 for the fifth and sixth challenge , respectively . The animals were exposed to SIV every three weeks or until positive viremia was measured . Challenge virus in plasma was detected by quantitative real-time RT-PCR using primers specific for SIV gag as described previously[66] . Presence or absence of anti-SIV envelope antibodies following SIV challenge was assessed by measuring the reactivity of sera ( before and after challenge ) against purified SIVmac251 truncated gp41 protein ( ImmunoDX ) by ELISA .", "headings": ["Abstract", "Introduction", "Results", "Discussion", "Materials and Methods"], "keywords": [], "id": "journal.ppat.1005090"}
{"lay_summary": "Biological cells use a variety of molecular machines representing enzymes , ion channels or pumps , and motors . Motor proteins are nanometer-size devices generating forces and actively moving or rotating under the supply of chemical energy through ATP hydrolysis . They are crucial for many cell functions and promising for nanotechnology of the future . Although such motors represent single molecules , their operation cycles cannot be followed in detail in simulations even on the best modern supercomputers and some approximations need to be employed . It is often assumed that conformational dynamics of motor proteins is well described within a linear response approximation and corresponds to excitation of normal modes . We have checked this assumption for two motor proteins , myosin V and kinesin KIF1A . Our results show that , while both these biomolecules respond by well-defined motions to energetic excitations , these motions are essentially nonlinear . The effect is particularly pronounced in KIF1A where relaxation proceeds through a sequence of qualitatively different conformational changes , which may facilitate complex functional motions without additional control mechanisms .", "article": "The assumption of linear response of protein molecules to thermal noise or structural perturbations , such as ligand binding or detachment , is broadly used in the studies of protein dynamics . Conformational motions in proteins are traditionally analyzed in terms of normal modes and experimental data on thermal fluctuations in such macromolecules is also usually interpreted in terms of the excitation of normal modes . We have chosen two important protein motors \u2014 myosin V and kinesin KIF1A \u2014 and performed numerical investigations of their conformational relaxation properties within the coarse-grained elastic network approximation . We have found that the linearity assumption is deficient for ligand-induced conformational motions and can even be violated for characteristic thermal fluctuations . The deficiency is particularly pronounced in KIF1A where the normal mode description fails completely in describing functional mechanochemical motions . These results indicate that important assumptions of the theory of protein dynamics may need to be reconsidered . Neither a single normal mode nor a superposition of such modes yields an approximation of strongly nonlinear dynamics . \n Protein machines , which may represent enzymes , ion pumps or molecular motors , play a fundamental role in biological cells and understanding of their activity is a major challenge . Operation of these machines is based on slow conformational motions powered by external energy supply , often with ligands ( such as ATP ) . In molecular motors , binding of ATP and its subsequent hydrolysis induce functional mechanochemical motions , essential for their operation . These motions , which follow after an energetic activation , are conformational relaxation processes . Large-scale conformational changes may take place in proteins as a result of ligand binding [1] . Despite the large magnitude of such changes , they are nonetheless often considered in the framework of the linear response theory [2] and the normal mode approximation [3]\u2013[7] . The normal mode analysis is furthermore broadly employed in the elastic-network studies of proteins [7]\u2013[18] . However , there is no general justification to assume that relaxation processes in proteins are linear and this assumption has to be verified for particular macromolecules . It is known that relaxation processes in complex dynamical systems may be strongly nonlinear and deviate much from simple exponential relaxation . As an example borrowed from a distant field , we can mention the Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction which exhibits a great variety of spatiotemporal patterns ( pacemakers , rotating spiral waves ) that are however only complicated transients accompanying relaxation to the equilibrium state [19] , [20] . Conformational relaxation in single protein molecules may also be a complicated process , comprising qualitatively different kinds of mechanochemical motions . While partial unfolding and refolding , associated with ligand binding , are known for some protein machines , such as the enzyme adenylate kinase [21] , usually functional conformational motions in molecular machines and , specifically , in motor proteins are elastic . This means that the pattern of contacts between the residues in a protein is not changed upon ligand binding and preserved during the relaxation process , as generally assumed in the elastic network modeling ( ENM ) . Here , we provide detailed analysis of conformational relaxation processes , associated with ligand binding and hydrolysis , in two motor proteins \u2014 myosin V [22] , [23] and kinesin KIF1A [24] . Our investigations , performed in the framework of the ENM approximation , reveal that nonlinearity is characteristic for both macromolecules and the normal mode description is not really applicable for any of them . For KIF1A , a monomeric motor protein from the kinesin superfamily , nonlinear effects are found to dominate completely functional mechanochemical motions which turn out to be qualitatively different from the normal mode predictions . Despite the nonlinearity , well-defined conformational relaxation paths , robust against perturbations , have been found in both motor proteins . \n The reference conformation , used to construct the elastic network , was that of the ATP ( analog ) bound state ( Protein Data Bank ( PDB ) ID code: 1W7J , with MgADP-BeFx as the ATP analog [30] ) . As the initial condition , the conformation corresponding to the nucleotide-free state was taken ( PDB ID: 1OE9 [31] ) . The elastic network had 855 particles connected by 7261 links . Note that only the residues whose -carbon positions are contained in both PDB data sets have been taken to construct the network . Additionally , relaxation processes starting from randomly generated initial conditions ( see Methods ) have been considered . For visualization purposes , motions of three particles ( Asp122 in chain A , and Val22 and Ser135 in chain B ) have been traced ( Figure 1A ) . Thus , each relaxation process was characterized by a certain trajectory in the space of distances between the three chosen labels . Figures 1B , 1C display 100 conformational relaxation trajectories , each starting from a different random initial condition . Although the initial conditions were generated by applying relatively strong deformations ( without unfolding ) to the reference state , almost all of them were leading back to that reference state , with just a few metastable states found . Furthermore , one can observe that the trajectories converge to a well-defined relaxation path . The red trajectory in Figures 1B , 1C is for the relaxation starting from the nucleotide-free conformational state of myosin V ( so that the mechanochemical motion following ATP binding is simulated ) . After a transient , this special trajectory joins the well-defined relaxation path . This functional trajectory is robust against perturbations , as shown by Figure 1D . Several snapshots of the conformation along this trajectory are shown in Figure 2 ( see also Video S1 ) . The attractive path corresponds to a deep energy valley in the energy landscape of myosin V . Once this valley is entered , the conformational relaxation motion becomes effectively one-dimensional and characterized by a single mechanical coordinate . The profile of the elastic energy along the bottom of such energy valley determines the dependence of the elastic energy on the collective mechanical coordinate ( see Methods ) . Figure 3A shows the dependence of the elastic energy along the special attractive relaxation path starting from the nucleotide-free state and leading to the ATP-bound state . Markers indicate positions along the trajectory in Figure 1C . For , the elastic energy is approximately quadratic in terms of the mechanical coordinate , i . e . . Because , this implies that then and the relaxation is exponential . Only within such harmonical neighborhood of the reference state , the normal mode description becomes applicable ( see Methods for further discussion ) . The dotted blue line in Figure 1D shows the direction of the distance changes corresponding to the slowest normal mode ( see Methods ) . The nucleotide-free state of myosin V lies away from this direction and also outside of the harmonical neighborhood . The initial stage of the functional mechanochemical motion ( until time ) cannot be quantitatively analyzed in terms of the normal modes . The reference conformation for KIF1A is the ADP-bound state ( PDB ID: 1I5S , with MgADP [32] ) . Relaxation starting from the initial condition , corresponding to the ATP ( analog ) -state ( PDB ID: 1I6I , with MgAMPPCP as an ATP analog [32] ) and from randomly generated initial conditions was considered . The elastic network has 320 particles and 2871 links . Only the residues whose -carbons are in both PDB data sets have been used . Visualization labels are Glu233 , Ala286 , and Asn211 ( Figure 4A ) . 100 relaxation trajectories , starting from random initial conditions , are shown in Figures 4B , 4C . The presence of an attractive relaxation path , corresponding to a deep energy valley , can be noticed . The red lines in Figures 4B , 4C display the special relaxation trajectory starting from the ATP-bound state . Surprisingly , we find that , in contrast to myosin V , this trajectory is different from the typical relaxation path . By applying small random initial perturbations to the initial ATP-bound state and integrating the dynamical equations , it can be demonstrated that this trajectory is , however , also stable with respect to the perturbations ( Figure 4D ) . The dotted blue line in Figure 4D shows the direction of the distance changes in the slowest normal mode of KIF1A . Thus , in KIF1A the deep energy valley leading to the reference ADP-bound state gets branched at some distance from it . The path corresponding to the functional mechanochemical motion from the ATP-bound state belongs to the side branch . Only at the final relaxation stage , in the immediate vicinity of the equilibrium , the valleys merge and the functional motion begins to coincide with the typical relaxation motion in this protein . The branching of the energy valley is already an indication of strong nonlinearity in the relaxation dynamics . We have also determined the profile of the elastic energy as a function of the mechanical coordinate along the path connecting the ATP- and ADP-bound states ( Figure 3B ) . The profile becomes quadratic only starting from time , very close to the equilibrium reference state . Figure 5 shows snapshots of KIF1A along the special attractive relaxation path ( see also Video S2 ) . At the early relaxation stage ( until ) , the relaxation motion represents a combination of the rotation of the switch II helix and of the sliding of the switch I loop . Relaxation at the end of such initial stage is apparently hindered , as revealed in the presence of a plateau in the dependence of the elastic energy on the mechanical coordinate in Figure 3B near . Only once the sliding is completed , further local structural reorganization , representing a transition from the loop to the -helix , becomes possible and is indeed observed approximately after time . \n The normal mode description is broadly used in structural studies of proteins . The analysis of thermal fluctuations and the interpretation of the respective experimental structural data are traditionally performed assuming that fluctuations are linear and , hence , correspond to thermal excitation of various normal modes ( see , e . g . , [3] , [4] ) . The linear response of a protein macromolecule to structural perturbations , such as ligand binding , is an often used assumption [2] . To a large extent , the elastic-network analysis of ligand-induced macromolecular motions is based on determining normal modes in the elastic networks of the considered proteins ( see , e . g . , [7] ) . The patterns of atomic displacements in such normal modes are further compared with the experimentally measured atomic displacements in the same proteins that are induced by a change of the chemical state , such as binding of an ATP molecule [7] , [14]\u2013[17] . Large overlaps with only a few slowest normal modes are seen as the evidence for the applicability of the elastic-network ansatz , whereas the wide distribution of overlaps is considered as the indication that the elastic network description fails for a particular macromolecule . Specifically , strong overlaps between ligand-induced conformational changes and atomic displacements in the few slowest modes have been found for scallop myosin and -ATPase , while such overlaps were absent for kinesin KIF1A [18] . Our numerical investigations of elastic conformational motions in two motor proteins ( myosin V and KIF1A ) have revealed however that in both of them the nonlinearities play an essential role . While slow conformational relaxation motions in myosin can still be qualitatively characterized in terms of the normal modes , the normal mode description breaks down completely for KIF1A . The observed breakdown of the normal mode description does not however mean that conformational motions become irregular . We have seen that ordered and robust mechanochemical motions are characteristic for both protein motors , even though they cannot be described in terms of the linear response . We want to emphasize that , when the dynamics is nonlinear , neither a single normal mode , nor a combination of many such modes can reproduce the motions . Thus , the normal mode description fails completely in this case and the problem is not that many normal modes must be taken into account . Actually , as we have shown , even for KIF1A , one normal mode would be sufficient to describe long-time relaxation within the harmonic domain \u2014 however , this domain is restricted to a tiny neighbourhood of the equilibrium state . Thermal fluctuations have not been explicitly included into our dynamical ENM simulations . However , such fluctuations are effectively generating random conformational perturbations . In our study , relaxation processes starting from random conformational perturbations have indeed been considered . In myosin V , one well-defined nonlinear conformational relaxation trajectory , leading to the equilibrium state , has been identified . Starting from an arbitrary initial conformation ( but still without unfolding ) , rapid convergence to this special trajectory takes place . While the motion corresponding to the special attractive trajectory is initially nonlinear , it becomes harmonical later and a substantial part of the ordered conformational relaxation process is within the harmonic domain of the equilibrium state . Similar behavior has been previously noted by us [29] for scallop myosin and -ATPase , but its detailed analysis has not yet been performed . The situation is more complex for the monomeric kinesin KIF1A . Instead of a unique deep energy valley leading to the reference ADP-bound state , two such valleys , both leading to the equilibrium state , are present . These valleys correspond to two kinds of ordered conformational motions possible in the protein . The first of them is relatively wide and , when thermal conformational fluctuations are excited , they would typically proceed along it . However , the conformational relaxation motion starting from the ATP-bound state follows a different path , which corresponds to the second energy valley branching from the typical fluctuation path already at very small deviations from the equilibrium state . Note that the branching takes place as the change in the distance between the molecular labels Glu233 and Ala286 is still less than an angstrom , which is much smaller than the intensity of typical thermal fluctuations for such a distance . Thus , the nonlinear effects in KIF1A are strong even for the typical thermal fluctuations . Remarkably , such second relaxation path is also stable with respect to perturbations , i . e . structurally robust . Our numerical investigations reveal that motion along this path can be divided into two qualitatively different stages . At the first of them , sliding of the switch I loop is observed , whereas at the second stage a transition from the loop to the -helix is realized . Structural reorganization , corresponding to this transition , is not possible until the sliding motion is completed , lifting a restriction through the backbone chain . Recent crystallographic studies suggest that the switch I loop/helix plays an important role in control of the motor function through interaction with and switch II [33] . Thus , in contrast to myosin , a single ATP binding event induces in KIF1A a complex , but ordered conformational motion characterized by two qualitatively different consequent phases . As we conjecture , this special dynamical property of KIF1A may be needed for the processive motion of this single-headed molecular motor [24] . In myosin V , conformational motions driven by random thermal fluctuations are similar in their properties to the relaxation motion from the nucleotide-free state . This may facilitate exploitation of such fluctuation motions for the motor operation , as suggested by recent single-molecule experiments [34] . In KIF1A , where the energy valley splits into two branches , typical thermal conformational fluctuations are qualitatively different from the relaxation motion starting from the previous ATP-bound state . The latter motion is entropically hindered for thermal fluctuations and cannot be reversed through them . This may turn out to be important for the understanding of the operation of the monomeric kinesin as a molecular motor . Latest experimental techniques permit simultaneous observation of stepping motion and conformational changes of a motor [35] . The coarse-grained modeling , including our present study , can contribute further suggestions for the design ( e . g . , by determining positions for fluorescent labeling ) of such experiments . Finally , we note that our study has been based on the elastic network approximation for proteins . More detailed descriptions , such as , e . g . , G-like models , can also be used to consider conformational relaxation processes [36] . We expect that similar behavior will then be observed . \n In this study , we employ elastic network models where material points are connected by a set of elastic springs [8]\u2013[11] . Each particle corresponds to a residue in the considered protein . The equilibrium positions of the particles are determined by the locations of -carbon atoms in the reference state of the protein , taken from the PDB database . Two particles in a network are connected by an elastic spring if at equilibrium the distance between them is less than a certain cutoff length . The natural length of an elastic link is equal to the equilibrium distance . The cutoff distance has been used in our study . The elastic forces obey the Hooke law and all springs have the same stiffness constant . Elastic torsion effects are not included . Thus , the force acting on particle is ( 1 ) where is the total number of particles in the network , is the actual position of the particle and is the actual distance between two particles and . The adjacency matrix of the network is defined as having if and otherwise . The total elastic energy of the network is ( 2 ) Because slow conformational dynamics of proteins in the solvent is considered , the motions are overdamped ( see [25] ) and the velocity of a particle is proportional to the force acting on it , i . e . where is the mobility . We assume that the mobilities of all particles are the same . Hydrodynamical effects are neglected ( they can be however incorporated into the elastic network models as shown in ref . [37] ) . Explicitly , the relaxation dynamics is described by a set of differential equations: ( 3 ) Here , time is rescaled and measured in units of . Hence , the relaxation dynamics of a network is completely determined by its pattern of connections ( matrix ) and the equilibrium distances between the particles . Equations ( 3 ) were integrated to determine conformational relaxation motions . To prepare random initial conditions , the following procedure has been employed . Random static forces , acting on all particles in the network have been independently generated with the constraint that . The equations of motion were integrated in the presence of such static forces for a fixed time . The conformation which was thus reached has been then used as the initial condition for the relaxation simulation . The parameters were , for myosin V and , for KIF1A . With these parameter values , relatively large overall deformations ( typical ) could be reached , while still avoiding unfolding . In the deformed states , the lengths of the links did not exceed for myosin V and for KIF1A . When relaxation from specific conformations has been considered , initial positions of all particles were allocated according to the respective PDB structures . When robustness of a relaxation path starting from a specific conformation was investigated , the initial condition was prepared by randomly shifting the positions of all particles with respect to their locations in that conformation with a certain root-mean-square displacement . We have chosen for myosin V and for KIF1A . To visualize conformational motions , three particles labeled as , and were chosen and the distances and were monitored in the simulations . Thus , the relaxation motion was represented by a trajectory on the plane . The choice of the visualization labels is essentially arbitrary . In a simulation , motions of all residues were traced ( see , e . g . , Videos S1 and S2 ) and different residues could be selected for a specific visualization . If a molecule has a low-dimensional attractive relaxation manifold , this is a property of the respective dynamical system and it cannot depend on the visualization method . When selecting the labels , one should only pay attention to the fact that the distances between them should significantly vary during the relaxation process . If , by chance , two labels belonging to the same stiff domain in a protein have been taken , the distance between them would remain almost constant , so that such a choice would be inconvenient . When the normal mode description approximately holds and , furthermore , relaxation is well described by a few slowest modes , one can choose the labels so that the distances between them reveal variations characteristic for the first few normal modes . Such selection was previously made [29] for scallop myosin and -ATPase , and it has been adopted in the present study for myosin V . For KIF1A , the labels have been chosen in such a way that motions in switch I and switch II regions are well resolved . The collective mechanical coordinate along a relaxation path was defined by requiring that its dynamics obeys the equation and that as . Multiplying both parts of this equation by , we find that it is equivalent to the equation ( 4 ) Equation ( 4 ) can be used to determine the coordinate along a given relaxation trajectory and the dependence of the elastic energy on this coordinate . For each point along the trajectory , the time when it is reached in the relaxation process is known . Moreover , the actual network configuration corresponding to this point is also known from the simulation . Therefore , for each point specified by time the respective elastic energy is determined . The mechanical coordinate , reached at time , is given by the integral ( 5 ) We provide a summary of the results on the normal mode description of conformational relaxation processes . If deviations from the reference conformation are small for all particles , the nonlinear equations ( 3 ) , describing conformational relaxation of an elastic network , can be linearized: ( 6 ) where . Equations ( 6 ) can be written in the matrix form as ( 7 ) where is the linearization matrix: ( 8 ) where . The general solution of these linear differential equations is given by a superposition of exponentially decaying normal modes , i . e . ( 9 ) Here , and are the eigenvalues and the eigenvectors of the linearization matrix , i . e . ( 10 ) This matrix has eigenvalues , but 6 of them must be zero , corresponding to free translations and rotations of the entire network . Generally , all normal modes are initially present . As time goes on , first the normal modes with the larger eigenvalues decay . In the long time limit , relaxation is characterized by the soft modes corresponding to the lowest eigenvalues . Figure 6 shows the computed eigenvalue spectra of myosin V and KIF1A . The eigenvalues are normalized to the lowest nonzero eigenvalue and the logarithmic representation is chosen . Note that in both motor proteins a significant gap , separating the soft mode from the rest of the spectrum , is present . This means that , in the linear approximation , long-time relaxation in these proteins is effectively characterized by a single degree of freedom , representing the amplitude of the soft mode . The pattern of displacements of particles ( i . e . , residues ) from the reference positions is determined by the eigenvector of the soft mode . In the plane of the distances between the labels , and , used by us for the visualization of conformational motions , the exponential relaxation motion corresponding to the soft mode should proceed along the direction defined by the vector with the components and . Such directions are indicated by dotted blue lines in Figure 1D and Figure 4D . When relaxation is reduced to a single soft mode , the elastic potential is quadratic in terms of the mechanical coordinate , i . e . . Note that the representation of the relaxation process as a superposition ( 9 ) of normal relaxation modes holds only in the harmonic domain , i . e . when linearization ( 6 ) of full nonlinear relaxation dynamics equations ( 3 ) is valid . If dynamics is nonlinear and the linearization does not hold , relaxation dynamics cannot be viewed at all as a superposition of any normal modes . Whether just one normal mode or many of them should be included into a description of long-time relaxation dynamics is determined by the properties of the eigenvalue spectrum and not related to the possible invalidity of the harmonic approximation . As an extension , iterative normal mode analysis has been proposed [21] , [38] . This method is applied to obtain an optimal sequence of conformational states , transforming an initial given conformation into a target conformation , which may be known with a low resolution or only partially , and thus to reconstruct missing details of that structure . Each next conformation in the sequence is obtained by making a step into the direction maximizing similarity with the target , restricted however to a superposition of a certain number of the lower normal modes . At the next iteration step , the previous conformation is chosen as a new reference state and a new set of normal modes is determined . This prediction method is useful and provides valuable results , e . g . , in the refinement of low-resolution structures from electron microscopy [38] . It should be however emphasized that the sequence of conformational states yielded by such a method is generally different from the path along which conformational relaxation from the target to the reference state would proceed . Even in the normal mode approximation , dynamics of conformational relaxation depends not only on the eigenvectors , but also \u2014 and very significantly \u2014 on the eigenvalues of normal modes . Generally , the next iteration state in this method would not be the next conformation along the actual relaxation path . This difference can be clearly demonstrated by considering the example of KIF1A . The conformational relaxation path transforming the initial ATP-bound state into the ( equilibrium ) ADP-bound state is non-monotonous ( Figure 4 ) . It proceeds via intermediate states ( particularly of the switch I region ) which cannot be obtained by gradual interpolation maximizing similarity of the structures along the optimization path .", "headings": ["Abstract", "Introduction", "Results", "Discussion", "Methods"], "keywords": ["computational biology/molecular dynamics", "biophysics/macromolecular assemblies and machines", "physics/interdisciplinary physics", "biophysics/theory and simulation"], "id": "journal.pcbi.1000814"}
{"lay_summary": "Endocytosis is the process that allows cells to take up molecules from the environment . Several endocytic pathways exist in mammalian cells . While the best understood endocytic pathway uses clathrin , recent years have seen a great increase in our understanding of clathrin-independent endocytic pathways . Here we characterize the crosstalk between caveolae , flask-shaped specialized microdomains present at the plasma membrane , and a second clathrin-independent pathway , the CLIC/GEEC Cdc42-regulated endocytic pathway . These pathways are segregated in migrating cells with caveolae at the rear and CLIC/GEEC endocytosis at the leading edge . Here we find that specific caveolar proteins , caveolins and cavins , can also negatively regulate the CLIC/GEEC pathway . With the help of several techniques , including quantitative electron microscopy analysis and real-time live-cell imaging , we demonstrate that expression of caveolar proteins affects early carrier formation , causes cellular lipid changes , and changes the activity of the key regulator of the CLIC/GEEC pathway , Cdc42 . The functional consequences of loss of caveolar proteins on the CLIC/GEEC pathway included inhibition of polarized cell migration and increased endocytosis in tissue explants .", "article": "Several studies have suggested crosstalk between different clathrin-independent endocytic pathways . However , the molecular mechanisms and functional relevance of these interactions are unclear . Caveolins and cavins are crucial components of caveolae , specialized microdomains that also constitute an endocytic route . Here we show that specific caveolar proteins are independently acting negative regulators of clathrin-independent endocytosis . Cavin-1 and Cavin-3 , but not Cavin-2 or Cavin-4 , are potent inhibitors of the clathrin-independent carriers/GPI-AP enriched early endosomal compartment ( CLIC/GEEC ) endocytic pathway , in a process independent of caveola formation . Caveolin-1 ( CAV1 ) and CAV3 also inhibit the CLIC/GEEC pathway upon over-expression . Expression of caveolar protein leads to reduction in formation of early CLIC/GEEC carriers , as detected by quantitative electron microscopy analysis . Furthermore , the CLIC/GEEC pathway is upregulated in cells lacking CAV1/Cavin-1 or with reduced expression of Cavin-1 and Cavin-3 . Inhibition by caveolins can be mimicked by the isolated caveolin scaffolding domain and is associated with perturbed diffusion of lipid microdomain components , as revealed by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching ( FRAP ) studies . In the absence of cavins ( and caveolae ) CAV1 is itself endocytosed preferentially through the CLIC/GEEC pathway , but the pathway loses polarization and sorting attributes with consequences for membrane dynamics and endocytic polarization in migrating cells and adult muscle tissue . We also found that noncaveolar Cavin-1 can act as a modulator for the activity of the key regulator of the CLIC/GEEC pathway , Cdc42 . This work provides new insights into the regulation of noncaveolar clathrin-independent endocytosis by specific caveolar proteins , illustrating multiple levels of crosstalk between these pathways . We show for the first time a role for specific cavins in regulating the CLIC/GEEC pathway , provide a new tool to study this pathway , identify caveola-independent functions of the cavins and propose a novel mechanism for inhibition of the CLIC/GEEC pathway by caveolin . \n Endocytosis encompasses a number of distinct internalization pathways with clathrin-mediated endocytosis ( CME ) of receptors and their bound ligands being the best understood [1]\u2013[7] . Caveolae , cup-shaped invaginations of the cell surface , have also received much attention as endocytic vehicles [8]\u2013[10] . However , the contribution to cellular endocytic uptake may vary greatly between cell types and conditions , reflecting striking tissue-specific distribution and , presumably , functions of caveolae [11]\u2013[13] . Caveola biogenesis involves the core structural membrane proteins CAV1 and muscle-specific CAV3 , which are essential for caveola formation . A coat protein complex , consisting of cavin family proteins , Cavin-1 , Cavin-2 , and Cavin-3 , and muscle-specific Cavin-4 has been shown to associate with caveolae at the plasma membrane ( PM ) [14]\u2013[19] , and together with the GTPase dynamin , the ATPase EHD2 , and pacsin2 , regulates caveola formation and dynamics [20] , [21] . Studies of caveolae have traditionally followed expressed caveolins as markers of caveolae , but it is now apparent that caveolins depend on cavins and associated proteins for association with , and formation of , caveolae . Excess non caveolar caveolin can be rapidly internalized and degraded , for example when caveolin is over-expressed or upon down-regulation of cavin proteins [18] , [22] . In contrast , caveolae generally bud off from the PM and recycle back to the surface , transitioning through classical Rab5-positive early endosomes . While caveolar endocytosis may not be a high capacity route in most cell types , the cycle of endocytosis and recycling is required for maintaining a constant caveolar density at the cell surface [13] , [23] , [24] . Caveolin-independent , clathrin-independent ( CI ) endocytic routes have , until recently , escaped extensive characterization because of the lack of specific cargo or regulators limiting the available biochemical or molecular tools to study their unique features . Hence , insights into clathrin-independent endocytosis ( CIE ) have been derived from combining general markers , such as fluid phase probes or membrane markers [25] , with cellular systems that lack or have been manipulated to inhibit the classical clathrin and caveolin routes . More recently , a number of endogenous cargo molecules trafficking by distinct , constitutive CI pathways have been identified , including glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins ( GPI-APs ) [26] , the interleukin-2 receptor [27] , and the major histocompatibility complex I [28] . These pathways differ based upon their dependence on dynamin function and reliance on small GTPases , namely Cdc42 , RhoA , or Arf6 , for cargo internalization [1] , [4] , [5] . Here , we have focused on the Cdc42-regulated , GPI-AP-positive CLIC/GEEC ( clathrin-independent carriers/GPI-AP enriched early endosomal compartment ) pathway , which constitutes a high capacity route for bulk fluid intake in fibroblasts [29] . Previous work has shown the unique , tubular morphology of the primary carriers ( CLICs ) in this pathway [23] and defined the early stages in the formation of these carriers: clustering of CLIC cargo , such as GPI-APs , within Cdc42-positive regions of the plasma membrane and requirement of local actin polymerization during formation of the carriers [26] , [30] , [31] . Using multiple fluid phase markers and pulse-chase experiments , it was shown that after CLICs are formed they bud rapidly , within 15 seconds , from the PM and acquire Rab5 and EEA-1 , maturing into the GEEC stage , before fusion with early endosomes and mixing with cargo from the CME pathway , such as transferrin ( Tfn ) [23] , [32] . Other recently revealed key regulators of the CLIC/GEEC pathway include a regulator of secretory traffic , Arf1 , and GRAF1 ( GTPase regulator associated with focal adhesion kinase-1 ) [33] , [34] . CLIC/GEEC endocytosis and caveolae share several similar properties , including the involvement of actin machinery , an important role for free cholesterol , and the action of specific protein/lipids residing in sphingolipid-rich membrane rafts [25] , [30] , [35]\u2013[37] . However , the two pathways show striking differences in migrating cells: CLIC-mediated endocytosis occurs at the leading edge of the cell while caveolae are localized to the rear [29] , [38] . Interestingly , over-expression of CAV1 , in cells either lacking CAV1 or containing endogenous CAV1 , has been shown to inhibit dynamin-independent internalization of cholera toxin subunit b ( CTxB ) and fluid phase markers [23] , [39] . Whether this has physiological relevance is not yet known . In this study we have refined and validated our systems that follow CLIC endocytosis and used them to study potential crosstalk with caveolae . Using internalized antibodies to the hyaluronan receptor , CD44 , as a CLIC-specific marker [29] , our studies reveal complex crosstalk between the two membrane systems at multiple levels . \n Various markers have been used to follow CIE pathways but CD44 has emerged as a highly specific cargo of the CLIC/GEEC pathway [29] , [40] . We therefore first optimized and validated the conditions for quantitatively studying CIE using antibodies against CD44 as a marker . An anti-CD44 monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) was added together with fluorescent transferrin ( Tfn-647 ) to cells for 2 and 10 min at 37\u00b0C . Prior to fixation , cells were placed on ice and acid stripped to remove any residual surface label , and internalized CD44 mAb was labeled with fluorescently tagged secondary antibody . For quantitative analysis of internalization , the fluorescence intensity of the internalized markers ( over the entire cell ) was normalized against the average fluorescence intensity of the internalized markers in control samples . By the following criteria , this procedure allowed us to use CD44 as a specific marker of the CLIC/GEEC pathway: ( 1 ) Anti-CD44 mAb internalization was distinct from uptake via clathrin coated pits , labeled with Tfn-647 , and did not colocalize with caveolae , indicated by probing for endogenous caveolar proteins , CAV1 and Cavin-1 ( Figure 1A ) . ( 2 ) CD44 mAb uptake was dynamin-independent , as determined by the use of the small molecule inhibitor dynasore . Under our experimental conditions , dynasore treatment inhibited Tfn-647 uptake but had no effect on CD44 mAb internalization ( Figure 1B ) [29] . ( 3 ) Uptake of CD44 mAb was completely inhibited by 7-ketocholesterol ( 7-KC ) treatment , shown in previous studies to result in reduced membrane order [41] , while Tfn-647 uptake was not significantly affected at this concentration ( Figure 1B ) . These results confirmed that in our system anti-CD44 antibody was internalized via the cholesterol-dependent , dynamin-independent CLIC/GEEC pathway [23] , [30] ( Figure 1B ) . Internalized anti-CD44 mAb therefore represents a specific marker of the CLIC/GEEC pathway that does not require a low temperature prebinding step and does not affect the kinetics or the magnitude of the pathway being studied [29] . Specific internalization of anti-CD44 mAb was confirmed by using a control antibody ( anti-GFP mAb ) at the same concentration in wild type mouse embryonic fibroblast cells ( WT MEFs ) and with anti-CD44 mAb in COS-7 cells , which lack CD44 receptor on the cell surface [42] . Under both conditions , no internalized antibody could be detected after 2 min at 37\u00b0C whereas COS-7 cells expressing CD44-GFP showed specific uptake of the anti-CD44 mAb ( Figure S1A , B ) . Additionally , using live cell imaging , we also observed colocalization between CD44-GFP and the fluid phase marker ( Dex-647 ) , suggesting that CD44-GFP is internalized via the CLIC pathway ( Figure S2 , Movie S1 ) . These internalization conditions were subsequently used to investigate the crosstalk between the caveolar and the CLIC/GEEC endocytic systems . Transient CAV1 over-expression , which leads to caveola formation in cells that express Cavin-1 , has been shown to inhibit CIE [23] , [39] , [43]\u2013[46] . To investigate whether this reflects a general role of caveolar proteins in the CLIC/GEEC pathway , we used CAV1 null ( CAV1\u2212/\u2212 ) and Cavin-1 null ( Cavin-1\u2212/\u2212 ) MEFs ( note these cells also have lower Cavin-1 and CAV1 protein levels , respectively , and so do not allow discrimination of specific effects of loss of either protein ( Figure S3A ) [18] ) . We compared the constitutive uptake of CD44 mAb and Tfn-647 in WT , CAV1\u2212/\u2212 , and Cavin-1\u2212/\u2212 MEFs after 2 min at 37\u00b0C; at this early time point of internalization , peripheral labeling for CD44 mAb was observed , consistent with a previous study [29] ( Figure 1C ) . A significant 2-fold increase in anti-CD44 mAb fluorescence , as a measure of CLIC internalization , was observed in CAV1\u2212/\u2212 and Cavin-1\u2212/\u2212 MEFs in comparison with WT MEFs ( Figure 1D ) . However , there was no significant effect on Tfn-647 uptake , indicating that CME was not affected ( Figure 1C , D ) . Additionally , CD44 mAb and Tfn-647 uptake was also performed in CAV1\u2212/\u2212 MEFs expressing Cavin-1-specific siRNA to characterize the functional consequences , if any , of loss of Cavin-1 in CAV1\u2212/\u2212 MEFs . No significant difference was observed in either CD44 mAb or Tfn-647 uptake between Cavin-1 siRNA ( 80% knock down ) and control siRNA-transfected CAV1\u2212/\u2212 cells ( Figure S3B ) . We also examined whether the increase in anti-CD44 mAb internalization was related to altered CD44 protein expression levels in WT , CAV1\u2212/\u2212 , and Cavin-1\u2212/\u2212 MEFs . Western blot analysis showed no statistically significant increase in the expression level of CD44 in CAV1\u2212/\u2212 MEFs but an increase in Cavin-1\u2212/\u2212 MEFs when compared with WT cells ( Figure 1E ) . However , quantitative immunofluorescence ( IF ) analysis showed no significant difference in the ratio of surface/total levels of anti-CD44 mAb labeling between WT , CAV1\u2212/\u2212 , and Cavin-1\u2212/\u2212 MEFs ( Figure 1F ) . Altogether , these results suggest that the CLIC/GEEC pathway may be upregulated in the absence of caveolar proteins . We therefore investigated the effect of loss of caveolar proteins on internalization of the fluid phase marker fluorescent dextran ( Dex-488 ) , which is partially internalized through the CLIC/GEEC pathway [23] , [26] . Dex-488 was internalized at 37\u00b0C for 5 min to provide sufficient signal-to-noise ratio . Similar to CD44 mAb uptake , a significant increase in Dex-488 internalization was observed in CAV1\u2212/\u2212 and Cavin-1\u2212/\u2212 MEFs in comparison with WT MEFs ( Figure 1G ) . Together , these data suggest that lack of caveolae , through two distinct genetic manipulations , causes upregulation of the CLIC/GEEC pathway . Thus , we next investigated the role of specific caveolar proteins in this regulation . We restored the levels of CAV1 and Cavin-1 in CAV1\u2212/\u2212 MEFs by expressing the fluorescent protein ( YFP/GFP ) tagged constructs , and then compared uptake of the CD44 mAb ( 2 min at 37\u00b0C ) between transfected and untransfected cells ( Figure 2A; Figure S4 ) . We observed 30\u201340% transfection efficiency for almost all transient transfections and only low transgene-expressing cells were analyzed . CD44 mAb endocytosis was drastically reduced in CAV1-expressing cells ( Figure 2B ) . More surprisingly Cavin-1 expressing CAV1\u2212/\u2212 MEFs also showed a dramatic decrease in CD44 mAb endocytosis ( Figure 2C ) . As CAV1\u2212/\u2212 cells lack morphological caveolae [23] this strongly suggests that Cavin-1 inhibits CLIC endocytosis independent of CAV1 and caveolae . Additionally , exogenous expression of Cavin-1 in Cavin-1\u2212/\u2212 MEFs was also observed to cause a significant decrease in CD44 mAb uptake ( Figure 2D ) . Neither CAV1 nor Cavin-1 expression affected Tfn-647 uptake . Compared with untransfected cells , CAV1 over-expression resulted in 95\u00b10 . 3% inhibition of CD44 mAb endocytosis , while Cavin-1 caused a 70\u00b12 . 2% inhibition ( Figure 2B , C ) . Since loss of caveolar proteins resulted in an increase in Dex-488 uptake , we also investigated the effects of reconstituted CAV1 and Cavin-1 expression in CAV1\u2212/\u2212 MEFs on Dex-488 uptake ( 5 min at 37\u00b0C ) . Similar to CD44 mAb uptake , expression of either CAV1 or Cavin-1 resulted in a significant decrease in Dex-488 uptake ( Figure S5A , B; 40\u00b17% inhibition in CAV1-expressing cells; 44\u00b16% inhibition in Cavin-1 expressing cells ) although not as high inhibition as observed with the specific CLIC marker , CD44 mAb . We also characterized the effect of other members of the caveolin family , CAV2 and CAV3 , on the CLIC/GEEC pathway . The ectopic expression of CAV3 , but not CAV2 , inhibited CD44 mAb uptake in CAV1\u2212/\u2212 MEFs , while Tfn-647 uptake was not affected by expression of either of the proteins ( Figure 2E , F ) . To test whether inhibition of the CLIC/GEEC pathway activity upon expression of caveolar proteins in our system ( CAV1\u2212/\u2212 MEFs ) is due to inhibition of CLIC/GEEC carrier formation , we used electron microscopy ( EM ) . CAV1\u2212/\u2212 MEFs were transiently transfected with CAV1-YFP , Cavin-1-GFP , and with GFP alone respectively and then the fluid phase marker horseradish peroxidase ( HRP ) was added for 2 min at 37\u00b0C to label the putative CLIC/GEEC carriers [23] , [29] . In comparison with cells expressing GFP alone , a significant decrease was observed in the number of CLICs in CAV1 and Cavin-1 transfected cells ( GFP: 100%; CAV1: 54\u00b14% decrease; Cavin-1: 55\u00b18% decrease; mean \u00b1 SEM ) , indicating that expression of caveolar proteins can limit the formation of carriers of the CLIC/GEEC pathway ( Figure 2G ) . These results suggested that both caveolins ( CAV1 and CAV3 ) and Cavin-1 are capable of negatively regulating the CLIC/GEEC pathway . This raised the question of whether inhibition is caused exclusively by free caveolar proteins , independent of caveolar formation . We addressed this question by testing whether inhibition of the CLIC/GEEC pathway occurred when levels of caveolin and cavin were balanced , as indicated by their colocalization and by the immobilization of CAV1 within caveolae . Cavin-1\u2212/\u2212 MEFs were transfected either with CAV1-YFP or with Cavin-1-mCherry alone or with both constructs simultaneously . Both CAV1 and Cavin-1 proteins were expressed in similar amounts in single and double transfections , as confirmed by quantitative Western blot analysis ( Figure 3A ) . Moreover , confocal images showed negligible levels of cytosolic Cavin-1 present in CAV1 and Cavin-1 co-expressing cells , and quantitative colocalization analysis showed a significantly higher degree of colocalization between CAV1 and Cavin-1 at the PM in comparison with analysis of randomized pixels for the same regions ( Pearson coefficient , PM: 0 . 80\u00b10 . 02; random: \u22120 . 007\u00b10 . 005; mean \u00b1 SEM , n\u200a=\u200a40 cells , p<0 . 0001 ) ( Figure 3B ) . In the same set of cells , anti-CD44 mAb and Tfn-647 uptake studies were performed . A significant decrease in CD44 mAb endocytosis was observed in cells co-transfected with CAV1 and Cavin-1 , whereas Tfn-647 uptake was not affected ( Figure 3C ) . To gain a quantitative estimation of free caveolar proteins present in our system upon co-expression of CAV1 and Cavin-1 , we made use of fluorescence recovery after photobleaching ( FRAP ) to analyze the mobility and diffusion properties of CAV1 . Cavin-1\u2212/\u2212 MEFs were transiently transfected with CAV1-YFP or co-transfected with CAV1-YFP and Cavin-1-mCherry respectively . After photobleaching a defined region of interest ( ROI ) at the PM , we compared the rate of fluorescence recovery of CAV1 between the single and co-transfected cells . A significant decrease in the mobile fraction ( CAV1: 0 . 82\u00b10 . 03; CAV1+Cavin-1: 0 . 58\u00b10 . 05 , p<0 . 05 ) and lateral diffusion ( CAV1: 0 . 13\u00b10 . 08; CAV1+Cavin-1: 0 . 039\u00b10 . 002; mean \u00b1 SD , n\u200a=\u200a15 cells , p<0 . 001 , see Text S1 ) of CAV1 was observed when co-expressed with Cavin-1 , in comparison with expression alone ( Figure 3D ) , suggesting that most of the CAV1 in the presence of Cavin-1 had been immobilized through the formation of caveolae . Taken together , these results suggest that the caveolar proteins , independent of caveolae , can inhibit CLIC endocytosis , but in addition , when incorporated into caveolae , there is also potent inhibition of CLIC endocytosis . To further investigate the unexpected regulatory role of cavins in CLIC/GEEC endocytosis , we analyzed the effects of ectopic expression of each of the four members of the cavin family ( Figure S6A ) on CD44 mAb internalization . In CAV1\u2212/\u2212 MEFs , moderate over-expression of Cavin-1 and Cavin-3 caused a significant decrease in CD44 mAb endocytosis , whereas in Cavin-2 and Cavin-4-expressing cells no effect on CD44 mAb endocytosis was observed ( Figure 4A ) . Expression of both Cavin-1 and Cavin-3 resulted in significant inhibition ( Cavin-1: 77 . 9\u00b13 . 3% decrease; Cavin-3: 76 . 9\u00b13 . 9% decrease; mean \u00b1 SEM ) of CD44 mAb endocytosis when compared with control cells ( 100\u00b113%; Figure 4B ) . These results reaffirmed the noncaveolar role of Cavin-1 as a negative regulator of CLIC/GEEC endocytosis . Furthermore , Cavin-3 was also observed to have a CAV1- and caveola-independent regulatory role in CLIC/GEEC endocytosis . We next assessed the effect of reducing cavin protein levels on the CLIC/GEEC pathway using a siRNA directed approach in 3T3-L1 fibroblasts , as we obtained more efficient knock down in this cell type compared with MEFs . Reduction of Cavin-1 levels ( by approximately 80% ) and Cavin-3 levels ( by approximately 50% ) resulted in an increase in CD44 mAb uptake in comparison with control siRNA-treated cells ( Figure 4C , D; Figure S6B ) . Reduction of Cavin-3 levels also led to an increase in Tfn-647 uptake while reduction in Cavin-1 did not , suggesting Cavin-3 might influence CME . To characterize the regulatory mechanism by which CAV1 inhibits the CLIC/GEEC pathway , we investigated the role of caveolin scaffolding domain ( CSD ) of CAV1 , as this domain has been shown to mediate several regulatory roles of CAV1 [47] , [48] . We tested CAV1 and CAV3 CSD point substitution mutants ( CAV1G83S; CAV3G55S ) and the deletion mutant ( CAV1\u039480\u2013100 ) as used in previous studies [43] . Expression of the CSD mutants , unlike the WT proteins , did not inhibit CD44 mAb internalization in CAV1\u2212/\u2212 MEFs ( Figure 5A\u2013C ) , suggesting that the CSD is required for inhibition of the CLIC/GEEC pathway . We next investigated whether the CSD is sufficient for inhibition by expressing the minimal CAV1 scaffolding domain as a fusion protein with GFP ( CAV1-SD , amino acid 82\u2013101 ) in CAV1\u2212/\u2212 MEFs . CD44 mAb uptake was significantly decreased ( 58\u00b13% decrease; mean \u00b1 SEM ) in cells expressing CAV1-SD while Tfn-647 uptake was unaffected ( Figure 5D ) . Taken together , these results suggest that inhibition of the CLIC/GEEC pathway by caveolin proteins requires an intact scaffolding domain and that this domain alone has significant inhibitory activity on CLIC endocytosis . The fact that the scaffolding domain has inhibitory activity when expressed in cells lacking endogenous CAV1 shows that the inhibitory activity of the mutant is not mediated through inhibition of interactions of proteins with endogenous CAV1 and caveolae but is an inherent property of this polypeptide . This suggests that CAV1 may affect fundamental membrane properties , as investigated in the following section . CAV1 has been shown to interfere with the mobility of membrane microdomain-associated proteins , which further blocks the integrin-mediated internalization of bacteria [49] . We investigated whether similar effects could underlie the influence of expressed CAV1 and cavins on the CLIC/GEEC pathway . We first analyzed , using FRAP , the degree of mobility of a lipid raft-associated CLIC/GEEC cargo protein , GPI-YFP , in the presence and absence of CAV1 . WT and CAV1\u2212/\u2212 MEFs were transiently transfected with GPI-YFP or co-transfected with GPI-YFP and CAV1-mCherry . To analyze the mobility of GPI-YFP , a small ROI was bleached at the PM , half-life times of fluorescence recovery were recorded and the resulting diffusion coefficients were calculated . When compared with WT MEFs or CAV1\u2212/\u2212 MEFs expressing CAV1 , a significant increase was observed in the mobility of GPI-YFP in CAV1\u2212/\u2212 MEFs ( diffusion coefficient for WT: 0 . 48\u00b10 . 03; CAV1\u2212/\u2212+CAV1: 0 . 50\u00b10 . 02; CAV1\u2212/\u2212 0 . 67\u00b10 . 03; mean \u00b1 SEM , n>20 cells , p<0 . 001 ) ( Figure 6A ) . We also analyzed the mobility of a model GPI-anchored protein in CAV1\u2212/\u2212 MEFs co-expressing GPI-YFP and the CSD mutant CAV1G83S . As expected , the mutant failed to decrease the mobility of GPI-YFP ( diffusion coefficient 0 . 78\u00b10 . 06 ) ( Figure 6A ) , suggesting that localization of CAV1 at the PM with an intact scaffolding domain is required to restrict the mobility of the tested microdomain-associated proteins . The very short half-life times ( around 8 . 5 seconds ) observed in the above analysis make it unlikely that the changes are due to a defect in trafficking of GPI-anchored proteins , as exocytosis and endocytosis occur at longer time scales . We next tested the effect of CAV1 on the mobility of the CLIC-specific cargo protein CD44 . To characterize CD44 membrane diffusion ability , we made use of an expression construct generated by fusing a photo-activatable variant of green fluorescent protein ( mRFP-PAGFP ) to CD44 ( mRFP-PAGFP-CD44 , termed PA-CD44 ) . First , we tested the internalization route of the PA-CD44 construct . PA-CD44 was photo-activated at a specific region of the PM of PA-CD44-expressing COS-7 cells . Internalized PA-CD44 showed significant colocalization with Dex-647-labeled endocytic vesicles in the photo-activated region consistent with endocytosis via the CLIC pathway ( Figure S7 , Movie S2 ) . For diffusion studies , PA-CD44 was photo-activated in a small ROI at the PM and decay of fluorescence over time was measured in CAV1\u2212/\u2212 MEFs and CAV1\u2212/\u2212 MEFs expressing CAV1 , respectively . In the presence of CAV1 , the CD44 diffusion rate was significantly decreased in comparison with CAV1\u2212/\u2212 MEFs and was on a similar time scale to that observed in the FRAP experiments ( Figure 6B ) . As the effects of CAV1 on CD44 and GPI-YFP may be mediated through its impact on physical properties of the PM , we then investigated whether stimulation of membrane fluidity by chemical or physical means would have any effect on internalization of cargo proteins of the CLIC/GEEC pathway using two independent treatments [49] , [50] . As a chemical stimulus , we treated CAV1\u2212/\u2212 MEFs with 0 . 05% Tween20 for 15 min at 37\u00b0C . After treatment , cells were incubated with anti-CD44 mAb and Tfn-647 for 2 min at 37\u00b0C . Secondly , we used high temperature , which can also alter the membrane mobility of proteins . CAV1\u2212/\u2212 MEFs were incubated with anti-CD44 mAb and Tfn-647 for 2 min at 41\u00b0C . Interestingly , both physical and chemical stimuli caused a significant increase in CD44 mAb uptake while Tfn-647 uptake was unaffected , compared with untreated cells ( Figure 6C ) . We further analyzed whether alterations in membrane fluidity or mobility of microdomain-associated proteins could overcome the inhibitory effect of CAV1 and Cavin-1 on their internalization by the CLIC/GEEC pathway . CAV1\u2212/\u2212 MEFs were transiently transfected with CAV1-YFP and Cavin-1-GFP respectively . Cells were either treated with Tween20 prior to uptake or incubated with endocytic markers at 41\u00b0C , as described above . Both treatments significantly increased CD44 mAb uptake , overcoming the inhibitory effect of CAV1 ( Figure 6D ) . In contrast the treatments did not affect endocytosis in Cavin-1 expressing cells ( Figure 6E ) . Tfn-647 internalization was also unaffected in both treated and untreated cells ( Figure 6D , E ) . We also tested the effect of an increase in membrane fluidity on fluid phase endocytosis . CAV1\u2212/\u2212 MEFs were transiently transfected with CAV1-mCherry , and Dex-488 uptake ( 5 min ) was performed at 41\u00b0C . At 41\u00b0C , Dex-488 uptake was unaffected by CAV1 expression , suggesting that higher temperature rescues the inhibition of both a specific CLIC marker and a fluid phase marker ( Figure 6F ) . Taken together , these results suggest that CAV1 expression can modulate the mobility of membrane microdomain-associated proteins . Treatments that increase the mobility of these proteins can at least partially restore endocytosis through the CLIC pathway . The physical and chemical stimuli described above alter mobility or fluidity of microdomain-associated proteins , an effect that might indicate lipid changes in the PM . As cholesterol is crucial for the function of the CLIC pathway [30] , we investigated the effect of these treatments on cellular cholesterol distribution using the polyene antibiotic , filipin . CAV1\u2212/\u2212 MEFs were transiently transfected with CAV1-YFP , treated with Tween20 or incubated with endocytic markers at 41\u00b0C , and labeled with filipin . In CAV1-expressing and treated cells , higher filipin labeling was observed ( 135 . 7\u00b14 . 8% for Tween20 and 132 . 7\u00b14 . 1% for 41\u00b0C; mean \u00b1 SEM ) in comparison with treated , untransfected CAV1\u2212/\u2212 MEFs ( 100\u00b11 . 6%; mean \u00b1 SEM ) ( Figure 6G ) or untreated CAV1-expressing cells . This suggests that CAV1 expression affects membrane cholesterol distribution/availability , which inhibits internalization via the CLIC/GEEC pathway . The physical and chemical stimuli restore cholesterol distribution allowing up-regulation of the CLIC/GEEC pathway . This effect is more complex than simply the availability of free cholesterol in the bulk membrane because cholesterol addition in the form of a cholesterol\u2013cyclodextrin complex did not rescue the CAV1-mediated inhibition ( unpublished data ) . Unlike CAV1 , physical and chemical stimuli could not rescue the internalization of CD44 mAb in Cavin-1-expressing cells ( Figure 6E ) , suggesting Cavin-1 might not act by regulating the mobility of microdomain-associated surface proteins in these cells . Cavins have also been reported to respond to cholesterol levels and alter cholesterol cellular distribution [51] , [52] . Thus , we next tested whether expression of Cavin-1 in cells lacking CAV1 could affect cellular cholesterol distribution by labeling Cavin-1-GFP-expressing CAV1\u2212/\u2212 MEFs with filipin to analyze the distribution of free cholesterol . In Cavin-1-expressing cells we observed a significant increase ( 138\u00b18 . 4%; mean \u00b1 SEM ) in filipin labeling in comparison with untransfected cells ( 100\u00b16 . 5%; mean \u00b1 SEM ) ( Figure 7A ) . These results suggest that Cavin-1 expression can alter the distribution of filipin staining , indicating a change in distribution of cholesterol in cells . To examine the possible implications of such alteration in lipid distribution , we focused on Cdc42 , whose localization and activation has been shown to depend on specific lipid organization at the PM [53] . CAV1\u2212/\u2212 MEFs were transiently transfected with Cavin-1-GFP and endogenous Cdc42 protein levels were analyzed by Western blotting . No effect was observed on total Cdc42 protein levels in Cavin-1-expressing cells ( Figure 7B , Figure S8 ) . We next characterized the correlation between Cavin-1 and Cdc42 at the PM . CAV1\u2212/\u2212 MEFs expressing Cavin-1-GFP were labeled for endogenous Cdc42 and subjected to Pearson coefficient analysis to calculate the correlation between the two proteins . This revealed a significant spatial correlation , compared with randomized values , between Cdc42 and Cavin-1 at the cell surface , although less than that between CAV1 and Cavin-1 ( Cavin-1\u2013Cdc42: 0 . 21\u00b10 . 02 , randomized: \u22120 . 01\u00b10 . 01 , CAV1\u2013Cavin-1 PM: 0 . 78\u00b10 . 02; mean \u00b1 SEM , n\u200a=\u200a40 , p<0 . 0001 ) ( Figure 7C ) . This suggested that Cdc42 and Cavin-1 might colocalize within regions of the cell surface . Indeed , live-cell imaging of CAV1\u2212/\u2212 MEFs co-transfected with Cdc42-GFP and Cavin-1-mCherry revealed that these two proteins co-accumulated in PM ruffles ( Figure S9A ) . Further live-cell imaging demonstrated that GPI-YFP also co-accumulated with Cavin-1-mCherry in PM ruffles , suggesting that these are sites for the possible association of Cavin-1 with CLIC components ( Figure S9B ) . We next tested whether Cavin-1 also affected Cdc42 activity , using a fluorescently tagged CRIB domain ( Cdc42/Rac-interacting binding domain from N-WASP ) . This construct ( CRIB-YPet ) binds to GTP-loaded Cdc42 and thus can act as a location biosensor for active Cdc42 . CAV1\u2212/\u2212 MEFs were either transfected with CRIB-YPet alone or co-transfected with both CRIB-Ypet and Cavin-1-mCherry . Quantitative line scan analysis of fluorescence intensity showed a high degree of colocalization between CRIB and Cavin-1 at the PM ruffles in comparison with cytosol ( Pearson coefficient , PM: 0 . 82\u00b10 . 04; cytosol: 0 . 35\u00b10 . 01; mean \u00b1 SEM , p<0 . 001 ) ( Figure 7D ) . This supported the notion that Cavin-1 colocalized with active Cdc42 in ruffles . We then tested whether Cdc42 could be activated by Cavin-1 expression . We used the FRET pair of Cdc42-CyPet and CRIB-YPet , whose association on GTP-loading of Cdc42 leads to a decrease in the lifetime of CyPet that can be measured by FLIM-FRET . CAV1\u2212/\u2212 MEFs were co-transfected with Cdc42-CyPet and CRIB-YPet either in the presence or absence of Cavin-1 . The lifetime of CyPet was significantly reduced , consistent with energy transfer in Cavin-1-expressing cells ( 1 . 5\u00b10 . 02 nanoseconds ) , compared with cells lacking Cavin-1 ( 1 . 64\u00b10 . 01 nanoseconds; mean \u00b1 SEM ) ( Figure 7E ) . Therefore Cavin-1 expression promotes activation of Cdc42 in CAV1-deficient cells . All together these results suggest that Cdc42 is selectively activated in PM ruffles when non-caveolar Cavin-1 is expressed in cells . We also noted additional cellular effects upon the loss of Cavin-1 . In WT MEFs , neither CAV1 nor Cavin-1 colocalized significantly with either anti-CD44 mAb or Tfn-647 after 2 or 10 min of uptake ( Figure 1A ) . However , in Cavin-1\u2212/\u2212 MEFs colocalization was observed between CAV1 and the internalized CD44 mAb but not with Tfn-647 after 2 min of uptake ( Figure 7F ) . We further confirmed this association of CAV1 with CLICs by assessing its localization following inhibition of either CLICs or CME . Upon inhibition of CME by the small molecule dynamin inhibitor dyngo4a , CAV1 still colocalized with the CD44 mAb , whereas this colocalization was lost when the CLIC/GEEC pathway was inhibited by 7-KC ( Figure S10 ) . This suggests that noncaveolar caveolin is preferentially recruited into the CLIC/GEEC pathway in cells lacking Cavin-1 . Loss of Cavin-1 also affects trafficking through the CLIC/GEEC pathway . After 10 min of uptake in the Cavin-1\u2212/\u2212 MEFs , internalized CD44 mAb and Tfn-647 were seen in the same endocytic vesicles ( Figure 7F ) ; this was not observed in WT or in CAV1\u2212/\u2212 MEFs . These results provide evidence for a novel role for caveolar proteins in regulating not only the magnitude but also specific features of the endosomal system . In this respect we noted a significant increase in the expression levels of Tfn receptor in Cavin-1\u2212/\u2212 MEFs ( Figure S11 ) . The inhibitory roles of caveolae , caveolins , and cavins suggest an important role for caveolae in regulating the CLIC/GEEC pathway . We therefore examined the physiological consequences of this inhibition . We first examined whether caveolae could play a role in spatial organization of the CLIC/GEEC pathway in migrating cells . A scratch-wound assay was applied to a confluent monolayer of CAV1\u2212/\u2212 MEFs co-expressing CAV1 and Cavin-1 . Fluorescently tagged CAV1 and Cavin-1 showed complete colocalization at the rear of the migrating cells ( Figure 8A ) , consistent with previous studies showing caveolae enriched in this domain [38] , [54] . CLIC endocytosis as detected by CD44 mAb uptake was dramatically reduced by the co-expression of the two caveolar proteins but the few carriers observed were invariably in areas lacking caveolae ( Figure 8A ) . Concomitantly , in confluent monolayers of CAV1-expressing CAV1\u2212/\u2212 MEFs , we also checked the cellular distribution of Cdc42 , a pivotal regulator of polarity and the CLIC/GEEC pathway . In CAV1-YFP-expressing cells Cdc42 expression , detected by a Cdc42-specific antibody , was observed to be excluded from CAV1-positive areas . Quantification of fluorescence intensity at the cell surface , by line scan analysis , showed a significant decrease in Cdc42 expression in regions of PM expressing high levels of CAV1 compared with low- or nonCAV1-expressing regions ( CAV1 high expression region: 14\u00b10 . 32; low/no expression regions: 26\u00b10 . 60; mean \u00b1 SEM , p<0 . 0001 ) , within the same cell ( Figure 8B ) . However , overall Cdc42 protein levels were unaltered in CAV1-YFP-expressing cells , as observed by Western blotting ( Figure 7B , Figure S8 ) . To further characterize the correlation between Cdc42 and CAV1 at the cell surface , we performed the Pearson correlation coefficient analysis on the same set of images that were used for line scan analysis . This revealed significantly less correlation between CAV1 and Cdc42 at the PM in comparison with CAV1 and Cavin-1 at the PM ( Pearson coefficient , CAV1\u2013Cdc42: 0 . 11\u00b10 . 01 , randomized: \u22120 . 002\u00b10 . 001 , CAV1\u2013Cavin-1 PM: 0 . 78\u00b10 . 02; mean \u00b1 SEM , n\u200a=\u200a40 , p<0 . 0001 ) ( Figure 8C ) . As expected from the above results , the activity of Cdc42 , monitored by recruitment of the CRIB domain , was also negatively affected by CAV1 expression . Quantitative line scan analysis showed significantly fewer CRIB protein in regions of the PM expressing high levels of CAV1 in comparison with lower-expressing regions ( PM region enriched in CAV1: 45\u00b11 . 9; PM regions with low/no CAV1 expression: 57\u00b12 . 4; mean \u00b1 SEM , p<0 . 001 ) within the same cell ( Figure 8D ) . This suggests that CAV1 expression can result in differential distribution of CLIC components; in addition , caveolae can locally inhibit CLIC endocytosis and help polarize the pathway to the leading edge . To test this hypothesis , we next examined the effect of loss of caveolar proteins on polarization of CLICs to the leading edge of 2D migrating fibroblasts , a key feature of the CLIC/GEEC pathway [29] . First we analyzed whether lack of caveolar proteins can alter cell migration by using a scratch-wound assay applied to confluent monolayers of WT , CAV1\u2212/\u2212 , and Cavin-1\u2212/\u2212 MEFs . As shown in a previous study [55] , we observed a significant decrease in ability of CAV1\u2212/\u2212 MEFs to close the wound compared with WT MEFs ( after wound closure at 12 h , WT: 84\u00b12 . 1%; CAV1\u2212/\u2212: 54\u00b14 . 1%; mean \u00b1 SEM , p<0 . 0001 ) ( Figure 8E ) . Similarly , Cavin-1\u2212/\u2212 MEFs also showed less efficient wound closure compared with WT MEFs and showed defects in cell migration ( after wound closure at 12 h , Cavin-1\u2212/\u2212: 60\u00b12 . 5%; mean \u00b1 SEM , p<0 . 001 ) ( Figure 8E ) . To characterize the polarization of CLICs in migrating cells , confluent monolayers of WT , CAV1\u2212/\u2212 , and Cavin-1\u2212/\u2212 MEFs were scratch-wounded and uptake of CD44 mAb and Tfn-647 was compared with the localization of CAV1 or Cavin-1 as cells migrated into wound . In both CAV1\u2212/\u2212 and Cavin-1\u2212/\u2212 MEFs , CD44 mAb internalization occurred at both the leading and trailing edge , indicating the CLIC/GEEC endocytosis was no longer polarized in these cells ( Figure 8F ) . Loss of caveolins and cavins has profound effects on specific tissues in vivo , including skeletal and striated muscle ( reviewed by [56] ) . To examine whether the loss of caveolar components also affected endocytic activity in a differentiated tissue relevant to disease , we isolated mature adult muscle fibers from the flexor digitorum brevis muscle of WT and Cavin-1\u2212/\u2212 mice . We assessed endocytic activity by adding either anti-CD44 mAb to the isolated fibers and visualizing uptake by IF , or by using HRP as a fluid phase marker for EM analysis . No significant difference was seen in CD44 surface labeling of the fibers , suggesting endogenous levels and surface accessibility of CD44 are not altered ( not shown ) . CD44 mAb internalization was dramatically increased in fibers isolated from Cavin-1\u2212/\u2212 mice ( 23 . 4\u00b12 . 9 , compared with WT: 2 . 2\u00b10 . 3; mean \u00b1 SEM ) ( Figure 9A ) . Similarly , isolated fibers incubated with HRP as a fluid phase marker showed a highly significant 4 . 5-fold increase in the volume of HRP-labeled structures , as compared with WT fibers ( Figure 9B\u2013D ) , indicative of greatly increased fluid phase endocytosis . Taken together , these data show that the CLIC/GEEC pathway is fundamentally altered by the loss of Cavin-1 demonstrating a dramatic in vivo consequence of loss of caveolar components . \n In this study we have identified extensive crosstalk , at several levels , between the caveolae and the CLIC/GEEC endocytic pathway in mammalian cells . Previous studies have shown that caveolin over-expression inhibits CIE [23] , [39] . We now show that both expression comparable with physiological levels and down-regulation of caveolin can regulate endocytosis , demonstrating that CAV1 is an important cellular endocytic regulator . Previous studies suggested a role for Tyr14 phosphorylation of caveolin in inhibition of plasma membrane Cdc42 required for fluid phase endocytosis [39] but this cannot explain the findings presented here . Firstly , CAV3 , which lacks a tyrosine residue equivalent to Tyr14 , is an equally potent inhibitor of CIE as is CAV1 . Secondly , we observed no significant CAV1 colocalization with Cdc42 . Finally , expression of the isolated caveolin scaffolding domain as a fusion protein with GFP also significantly inhibited the CLIC/GEEC endocytosis . This inhibition was observed even in cells lacking endogenous caveolins , arguing against an effect on caveolin-signaling protein interactions . These results hinted at a more general mechanism of inhibition , and in view of previous studies [49] , [57] prompted us to test whether specific properties of the plasma membrane were affected by CAV1 expression . Expression of CAV1 significantly decreased the membrane mobility of CD44 and GPI-YFP membrane microdomain-associated CLIC cargo proteins . Interestingly , effects of CAV1 on both diffusion properties and internalization of CLIC cargo proteins required an intact scaffolding domain of CAV1 , as inhibitory effects were lost with single-point mutations in this region . A role for CAV1 , dependent on the scaffolding domain , has been reported in regulation of dynamin-dependent , raft-mediated internalization of the CTxB as well as in endocytosis of bacterial engaged integrins [48] , [49] . It is therefore tempting to speculate that perturbation of membrane properties by CAV1 expression underlies the effect on the CLIC/GEEC endocytosis . We could significantly rescue the inhibition of CLIC/GEEC endocytosis exerted by CAV1 on CD44 mAb and fluid phase marker uptake by using previously characterized chemical and physical stimuli , which enhanced the fluidity of the PM [49] . Under these conditions , we also observed increased cellular staining for free cholesterol , but only in CAV1-expressing cells . We conclude that complex changes in cholesterol trafficking/accessibility may accompany CAV1 expression , specifically perturb CLIC/GEEC endocytosis through effects on membrane lipid composition , and be rescued by experimental manipulation of membrane fluidity . Independent studies from our laboratory have shown that loss of CAV1 also has striking effects on nanoscale organization of the plasma membrane , including increased clustering of phosphatidylserine and farnesylated K-ras but decreased nanoclustering of dually palmitoylated H-ras [58] . Additionally , quantitative EM analysis pointed at a direct inhibitory effect of CAV1 on early carrier formation in the CLIC/GEEC pathway . However , we cannot rule out additional CAV1 effects on the mobility of microdomain-associated cargo proteins affecting access into the CLIC pathway . The effect of the 20-amino acid scaffolding domain of CAV1 on CIE indicates that this domain of caveolin can have potent biological activity even in cells lacking endogenous caveolin . The activities of corresponding peptides added to cells in the form of a cell-penetrating fusion protein are well described as potent activators of endothelial nitric-oxide synthase ( eNOS ) through inhibition of caveolin\u2013eNOS interactions and implicated in regulation of Rac1 signaling , a putative CLIC-interacting protein , by CAV1 [29] , [59] , [60] . However , these effects are observed only in cells with endogenous caveolin [47] , unlike the effects described here . Nevertheless , the potent effects of the isolated scaffolding domain on endocytic trafficking described here should be taken into account when evaluating the effects of these peptides in cells and tissues . In addition , the role of CAV1 in many signaling pathways could potentially be explained by the inhibition of this major endocytic pathway in view of the importance of endocytic trafficking in many signaling events [61] . Again , consistent with this , both inhibition of signaling [60] , [62] , [63] and CLIC endocytosis ( this study; [39] ) show a similar dependence on the caveolin scaffolding domain . To our surprise , our studies also revealed a novel noncaveolar regulatory role for cavin family proteins , specifically Cavin-1 and Cavin-3 . While expression of non-caveolar Cavin-1 inhibited the formation of CLIC/GEEC carriers we could not detect any changes in the physical properties of the membrane upon Cavin-1 expression , although more subtle changes below our detection limits certainly cannot be excluded . Instead , single cell-based analysis of Cavin-1 expressing CAV1\u2212/\u2212 MEFs consistently demonstrated an increased intracellular filipin labeling . Our recent studies showed that Cavin-1 expression in prostate cancer cells that express endogenous CAV1-modulated secretion pathways and cholesterol distribution , with decreased levels of cholesterol and impaired recruitment of actin to the detergent resistant membranes [51] . In view of the dependence of the CLIC/GEEC pathway on actin and cholesterol [30] , including perturbation by 7-KC , as shown in the present study , it is likely that Cavin-1 regulates the CLIC/GEEC pathway through effects on cholesterol trafficking and/or distribution . However , it is intriguing that this inhibition can occur in the absence of CAV1 and caveolae . In this context it is noteworthy that detailed real-time observations of Cavin-1 localization in CAV1\u2212/\u2212 cells revealed colocalization with active Cdc42 and GPI-AP in membrane ruffles . Availability of phosphatidylserine ( PS ) at the PM has been shown to be critical for membrane localization and activation of Cdc42 [53] , and previous work from our laboratory has shown that Cavin-1 can bind to the PS at PM [18] . Hence it seems plausible that by interacting with CLIC components/regulators at the PM Cavin-1 regulates the activity of the pathway . In support of this hypothesis we observed that Cavin-1 could modulate Cdc42 activity and so perturb the Cdc42 activation\u2013deactivation cycle . This would be limiting for the activity of the CLIC/GEEC pathway , which is dependent on a functional Cdc42 cycle with inhibition by an activated form of Cdc42 [30] , [33] . Cavin-1 appears to be a highly specific regulator of the CLIC/GEEC pathway in comparison with CME and may be a useful tool to further characterize the CLIC/GEEC endocytic route . In wild-type cells , CD44 is rapidly sorted into a distinct , transferrin-negative recycling route [29] but this sorting ability of CLICs was reduced in Cavin-1\u2212/\u2212 cells , suggesting a novel role for Cavin-1 in endosomal sorting possibly through indirect effects on cholesterol . Similar observations were not made in CAV1\u2212/\u2212 cells even though these cells have reduced Cavin-1 levels . An intriguing possibility is that the low levels of noncaveolar CAV1 in CAV1\u2212/\u2212 , which we show is internalized predominantly through the CLIC/GEEC pathway , has a modulatory effect on sorting in the endocytic pathway . In our system Cavin-3 also showed a potent and specific inhibition of the CLIC/GEEC endocytosis when expressed alone , while knockdown led to a significant increase in both CLIC/GEEC and clathrin-dependent endocytosis . A systemic study of endocytosis , exploiting multi-parametric image analysis and multi-dimensional gene profiling , has also implicated Cavin-3 in endocytic trafficking of transferrin [64] . Together , these studies suggest a more general role for Cavin-3 in regulation of endocytic trafficking . Co-expression of caveolar proteins in cells generated caveolae and negatively regulated the CLIC/GEEC pathway . Our results suggest that association of caveolins and cavins with caveolae does not perturb their inhibitory activity and hence identifies cavins , caveolins and caveolae as regulators of CI endocytosis . What might be the function of this complex regulatory network ? Caveolae are polarized in migrating cells and highly concentrated at the rear of the cell [18] , [29] , [38] , [54] . In contrast , CLIC/GEEC endocytosis predominantly occurs at the leading edge of migrating cells [29] . In line with the above studies , we observed that expression and activation of the CLIC regulator , Cdc42 , was differentially distributed in areas of the PM significantly devoid of CAV1 expression . Upon expression of CAV1 and Cavin-1 , CLIC/GEEC endocytosis is reduced but residual endocytosis occurs exclusively in regions devoid of caveolae , suggesting potent local inhibition of endocytosis . Conversely , loss of CAV1 and/or Cavin-1 causes a reduction in polarized migration and polarization of CLIC/GEEC endocytosis leading to increased endocytosis at the rear of the cell . This suggests that polarization of the CLIC/GEEC pathway is dependent directly or indirectly on the caveolar membrane system and that caveolae can \u201cdampen\u201d endocytic activity at the rear of the cell . This model is further strengthened by examination of explant tissues from mice lacking caveolae due to genetic deletion of Cavin-1 . WT skeletal muscle fibers show a remarkable density of caveolae and relatively low endocytic activity . Loss of caveolae in the skeletal muscle of Cavin-1\u2212/\u2212 mice causes a dramatic increase in endocytic activity as monitored by CD44 mAb uptake and by fluid phase uptake . It is now clear that the consequences of expression of caveolins or cavins are highly complex and modulation of membrane traffic and lipids must be taken into account in understanding their actions . The evolution of two sets of protein components associated with caveolae as independent inhibitory agents , when free or incorporated into caveolae , and the profound cellular consequences of their loss emphasizes the importance of the caveolar system as a key regulator of endocytosis in mammalian cells . \n All the animal experiments were conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the ethics committee at The University of Queensland .

WT , immortalized CAV1-null ( CAV1\u2212/\u2212 ) , Cavin-1 null ( Cavin-1\u2212/\u2212 ) mouse embryonic fibroblasts ( MEFs ) , 3T3-L1 and COS-7 cells were maintained in Dubelcco's modified Eagle's medium ( DMEM; Gibco ) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum ( FBS; Cambrix ) and 2 mM L-Glutamine at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 . For transfection , cells were either electroporated ( BIORAD ) or Lipofectamine 2000 ( Invitrogen ) was used , as per the manufacturer's instructions , and by this method 30\u201340% transfection efficiency was achieved . For siRNA transfection , Cavin-1 and Cavin-3-specific oligonucleotides were transfected at a final concentration of 600 pM using Lipofectamine 2000 . Cells grown on 12 mm coverslips were placed on 50 \u00b5l pre-warmed drops containing 10 \u00b5g/ml anti-CD44 antibody/3 mg/ml Dex-488/10 \u00b5g/ml anti-GFP antibody+10 \u00b5g/ml Tfn-647 diluted in culture media and incubated at 37\u00b0C in a 5% CO2 incubator for time indicated . To remove any surface bound markers ( CD44 mAb , GFP mAb , or Tfn-647 ) , 2\u00d730-second acid stripping was performed with 0 . 5 M glycine ( pH 2 . 2 ) , before fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde . The cell migration ( scratch-wound ) assay and immunocytochemistry were performed as previously described [29] . For cholesterol staining , cells were labeled with filipin , 50 \u00b5g/ml , for 2 h in the dark . For Cdc42 staining , cells were fixed with 10% TCA and quenched using 3\u00d75-min washes of 30 mM glycine on ice . Permeabilized cells were blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) and incubated in primary antibody overnight at 4\u00b0C followed by Alexa Fluor conjugated secondary antibody incubation for 40 min at room temperature . In transfected CAV1\u2212/\u2212 MEFs , HRP uptake ( 10 \u00b5g/ml ) was performed at 37\u00b0C for 2 min , and after brief washing with DMEM containing 1% BSA , diaminobenzidine ( DAB ) ( 10 mg/ml ) reaction was performed on the live cell as previously described in [29] . Fixation , embedding , and sectioning were performed as follows . MEFs were fixed with 2 . 5% glutaraldehyde in 0 . 1 M cacodylate buffer ( pH 7 . 4 ) . Cells were post-fixed with 1% osmium tetroxide for 1 h at room temperature and serially dehydrated with ethanol . Cells were embedded in increasing ratios of LX-112 resin\u2236ethanol to 100% resin , and polymerized overnight at 60\u00b0C . Ultrathin ( 60 nm ) sections were cut on a Leica UC6 microtome and imaged on a JEOL1011 electron microscope at 80 kV . Quantifications were performed as follows: the perimeters of approximately 16 cells ( per experimental condition ) were imaged and the number of CLICs/GEEC carriers from each cell was quantified and averaged across all 16 cells . The average number of CLICs/GEEC carriers per cell was generated from two separate repeats of the same experimental conditions . Cells were grown either on 12 mm coverslips or on 35 mm glass bottom dishes ( Mat-Tek Corporation ) and fluorescence micrographs were captured for random fields containing transfected cells on a confocal laser-scanning microscope ( Zeiss 710 META; 510 META; Carl Zeiss Inc . ) . Images were captured with a 63\u00d7 plan Apochromat 1 . 4 NA Oil objective ( Zeiss , Jena , Germany ) , using a 488 nm laser line for excitation and a 505\u2013530 nm band pass emission filter to capture GFP and Alexa Fluor 488 fluorescence , a 561 nm laser line for excitation , and a 580\u2013620 nm band pass emission filter to capture RFP/mCherry/Alexa Fluor 555 fluorescence , and a 633 nm laser line for excitation and a 650 long pass emission filter for emission to capture Alexa Fluor 647 fluorescence . For live cell co-imaging of Cherry and YFP , YFP fluorescence was captured using the 488 nm laser line for excitation and a 505\u2013530 nm band pass for emission . For live cell imaging a region of interest was chosen and 2\u00d7 digital zoom was applied . Optical path and emission filters were applied as appropriate for each fluorophore . Images were processed with Adobe Photoshop CS3 ( Adobe , San Jose , CA ) and fluorescent intensity of fluorophores on images was measured using ImageJ ( National Institutes of Health , Bethesda , MD ) . Where indicated , correlation between fluorescence intensities between two fluorophores in different subcellular location was determined using Pearson coefficient analysis . For this , binary masks ( values 0 and 1 ) were created to isolate pixels belonging to different regions of interest ( such as the plasma membrane and/or cytosol ) by multiplying ( pixel by pixel ) the mask image by the raw images . This method was chosen in preference to the Pearson analysis over the entire cell as it provides a better estimation of whether or not a high correlation exists between different fluorophores at a specific subcellular location , for example the plasma membrane . Then , each individual image ( two channels ) was used to calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between the two fluorophores in each specific subcellular location , and the data represent an average Pearson correlation coefficient determined for at least 40 cells from at least three independent experiments . To assess GPI-YFP dynamics , cells were seeded on 35 mm glass bottom dishes and transfected with GPI-YFP construct [65] . Images were captured on an inverted confocal microscope using a 63\u00d7 plan Apo 1 . 4 NA , Oil objective with 4\u00d7 digital zoom , with a resolution of 0 . 15 \u00b5m/pixel . A circular region of interest ( ROI , 4 . 7 \u00b5m radius ) was bleached to \u223c70% using the 488 nm argon laser line and 405 nm laser line at 100% transmission . Time-lapse images of the same region and a reference region of identical size were acquired before ( 20 frames , 5 seconds ) and after ( 300 frames , 90 seconds ) photobleaching with an interval of \u223c250 milliseconds per frame using the 488 nm laser line at 2% transmission and emission detected between 500 and 530 nm . Half-life time and diffusion rate were calculated as described previously [49] , [66]; also see Text S1 for details . CAV1 dynamics were determined in Cavin-1\u2212/\u2212 cells expressing CAV1-YFP alone or co-transfected with CAV1-YFP and Cavin-1-mCherry . Images were acquired as described above and half-times were calculated as described previously for CAV1-GFP in HeLa cells [67] , [68] . The lateral diffusion nature of CAV1-YFP recovery curves at the plasma membrane was determined by performing FRAP experiments at variable ROI areas ( 9 . 6 , 14 . 4 , and 16 . 6 \u00b5m2 ) to analyze the dependency of half times with area size . Linear regression was performed and the diffusion coefficient for simple lateral diffusion was extracted from the slope as described in Text S1 . To achieve spatially defined photoactivation of PAGFP , a Ti:sapphire two-photon laser ( 1600\u20131800 mW Chameleon Ultra , Coherent Scientific ) tuned at 775 nm was used [69] . For lateral diffusion studies of CD44 , the plasma membrane region of cells was identified with the mRFP signal of CD44-mRFP-PA-GFP . PAGFP fluorescence was activated using a constant circular region of interest ( ROI , 1 . 98 \u00b5m radius ) by a single scan with infrared laser irradiation ( 30% transmission ) , and time-lapse images of photo-activated GFP at the same region were captured every \u223c250 millisecond using a 60\u00d7 plan Apo 1 . 4 NA , Oil objective at 4\u00d7 digital zoom and appropriate filter sets to capture GFP fluorescence . For each time point , the average fluorescence intensity was calculated and normalized to the value at the first frame after photo-activation . Decay curves were fitted to a double exponential decay curve and a global half-time of fluorescence decay was obtained numerically as described for FRAP experiments . CAV1\u2212/\u2212 MEFs expressing FRET pair ( Cdc42-CyPet and CRIB-YPet ) either in presence or absence of FLAG-tagged Cavin-1 were subjected to FLIM microscopy as described previously [18] . Cells were serum starved for 3 h in serum-free DMEM before incubation with 60 \u00b5M dynasore/Dyngo-4a . Internalization assay was performed in the presence of 40 \u00b5M dynasore for the desired amount of time . Cells were treated with 30 \u00b5M 7-ketocholesterol ( 7-KC ) for 30 min at 37\u00b0C , followed by the internalization assay . Whole cell lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and further to Western blotting . Membranes were probed with primary antibody at the desired concentration for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4\u00b0C , followed by incubation with either secondary HRP-conjugated antibodies or infrared dye-labeled Odyssey secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature . For detection , either the Licor Odyssey infrared imaging system was used , as per the manufacturer's instructions ( Licor Biotechnology ) , or the SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate ( Pierce ) was captured on film ( Kodak ) . Densitometric analysis of protein bands was performed either by ImageJ or by using Licor Odyssey analysis software . Also see Text S1 for details . Muscle fibers were isolated from WT and Cavin-1\u2212/\u2212 adult mice using a method described previously [70] , with modifications . For EM analysis of HRP uptake , isolated fibers cultured overnight on matrigel-coated plastic dishes were incubated in HRP ( 10 mg/ml ) at 37\u00b0C for 5 min , washed briefly , then fixed in glutaraldehyde before DAB visualization of the HRP reaction product . Quantitation of the volume of HRP-labeled elements relative to the sampled cytoplasmic volume ( volume density ) was determined by point counting of peripheral areas of WT and Cavin-1\u2212/\u2212 muscle fibers , as shown in previous studies [29] . For procedure details see Text S1 . Statistical analyses were conducted using Microsoft Excel and Prism ( GraphPad ) .

{"lay_summary": "Two-Component Signaling ( TCS ) systems are a primary means by which bacteria sense their constantly changing external environment . For pathogens , these relays are key to their host survival . A typical TCS pair consists of a sensor protein , which upon an environmental stimulation will initiate a cellular response by transferring a phosphate group onto a crucial aspartate amino acid within a secondary receiver ( REC ) protein . However , more recently it has come to light that some REC proteins are missing key amino acids involved in this signaling relay process , including the aspartate residue required for the signaling relay , hinting that a subset of REC proteins might function in different ways . Here we use custom programing to extract all deposited Aspartate-Less Receivers ( ALRs ) for further examination . Surprisingly , we found that on average there are two ALRs present in every microbial species , making them a significant portion of the bacterial signaling family . Combining computational data with structural , biochemical and genetic examination of a founding member of the ALR family , Repressor of Iron Transport Regulator ( RitR ) from the human pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae , we demonstrate that ALRs might have evolved to accommodate more diverse environmental signals , while largely retaining their time-tested ancestral post-input signaling mechanisms .", "article": "Two-component signaling systems are ubiquitous in bacteria , Archaea and plants and play important roles in sensing and responding to environmental stimuli . To propagate a signaling response the typical system employs a sensory histidine kinase that phosphorylates a Receiver ( REC ) domain on a conserved aspartate ( Asp ) residue . Although it is known that some REC domains are missing this Asp residue , it remains unclear as to how many of these divergent REC domains exist , what their functional roles are and how they are regulated in the absence of the conserved Asp . Here we have compiled all deposited REC domains missing their phosphorylatable Asp residue , renamed here as the Aspartate-Less Receiver ( ALR ) domains . Our data show that ALRs are surprisingly common and are enriched for when attached to more rare effector outputs . Analysis of our informatics and the available ALR atomic structures , combined with structural , biochemical and genetic data of the ALR archetype RitR from Streptococcus pneumoniae presented here suggest that ALRs have reorganized their active pockets to instead take on a constitutive regulatory role or accommodate input signals other than Asp phosphorylation , while largely retaining the canonical post-phosphorylation mechanisms and dimeric interface . This work defines ALRs as an atypical REC subclass and provides insights into shared mechanisms of activation between ALR and REC domains . \n In a changing environment organisms must have means to effectively respond to external stimuli or perish . In bacteria , although so-called One-Component Signaling systems numerically dominate microbial genomes [1] , Two-Component Signaling ( TCS ) systems also play crucial roles in adaptation to the changing external environment [2 , 3] . Classical TCS systems consist of a membrane-bound histidine kinase that upon sensing an external stimulus , autophosphorylates using ATP as a phosphate donor and then subsequently transfers the phosphate to a conserved Asp residue within a cognate Receiver ( REC ) domain-containing partner in the cytoplasm . REC domains adopt the flavodoxin fold , a very common ( \u03b1/\u03b2 ) 5 architecture with a central 5-parallell \u03b2-sheet . The typical REC active pocket structure consists of an \u2018acidic triad\u2019 that includes the phospho-accepting Asp residue at the end of the \u03b23 strand and two other acidic amino acids within the \u03b21-\u03b11 loop , an \u2018invariant\u2019 lysine ( Lys ) residue at the end of the \u03b25 strand and a metal ion ( usually Mg2+ ) that are coordinated through hydrogen bonding [4] . Crystalline and solution structure comparisons of inactive ( unphosphorylated ) and active ( phosphorylated ) REC states have revealed a conserved signaling mechanism that centers around an equilibrium shift [5 , 6] and reorientation of a threonine/serine ( Thr/Ser ) and tyrosine/phenylalanine ( Tyr/Phe ) pair toward the phosphorylated Asp residue [7\u201311] . First described by Zhu et al . [12] , this so-called \u201cY/T-coupling\u201d results in a repositioning of the quaternary structure , usually through the \u03b14-\u03b15-\u03b15 interface of the REC protein architecture , to allow the precise alignment of ionic and hydrophobic residues to form the normally observed active homodimer [13 , 14] , although now a possible alternative dimeric interface centered around the \u03b11-\u03b15 face has also been described [15 , 16] . After these events the C-terminal Effector Domain ( ED ) [17] , which is often a DNA-binding domain but can also take the form of many other output modules [4 , 18] , is then freed of the physical restraint implemented by close contact with the REC domain to enable downstream signaling [4 , 15 , 19] . With a plethora of available genome sequences to sample , a second class of more divergent REC domains has emerged . These sequences typically lack one or more of the aforementioned standard \u2018invariant\u2019 features of the canonical variety , including loss of secondary structural features and key residues involved in coordination of the catalytic pocket . Some of these \u2018atypical\u2019 REC domains have diversified to accommodate signaling inputs that include binding small molecules such as antibiotics [20] , and interestingly Ser-Thr phosphorylation through bacterial eukaryotic-like Ser-Thr kinases and their cognate PP2C phosphatases , which regulate crucial cell envelope-related functions and virulence in many microbes [21 , 22] . A key feature of many atypical REC domains is the lack of conservation of the phosphorylatable Asp residue , indicating they are regulated by input signals other than histidine phosphorylation . Described examples identified thus far come from bacterial pathogens and environmental microorganisms including RitR from Streptococcus pneumoniae [23 , 24] , AmiR from Pseudomonas aeruginosa [17] , RedZ from Streptomyces coelicolor [20] , HP1043 from Helicobacter pylori [25] , ChxR from Chlamydia trachomatis [26 , 27] , FrzS from Myxococcus xanthus [28] , KiaA from Synechococcus elongatus [29] , and several have also been described in plants [30] , all of which are involved in important cellular processes . As the importance of these non-canonical REC domains are becoming increasingly apparent , we wanted to know how prevalent they are in nature , if they bear functional and structural similarities to canonical REC domains , and importantly how they transduce a signal in the absence of phosphorylation . To gain insight into these questions we first designed a custom program to extract all deposited REC domain sequences that are missing the predicted phosphorylatable Asp residue . Surprisingly , we found that these sequences comprised ~4% ( or in bacteria ~2 per completed genome ) of all REC domains . Given their representation , we then defined them as the Aspartate-Less Receiver ( ALR ) domain subclass of atypical RECs . These data reveal that although the largest category of ALR EDs consists of DNA-interacting modules , based on their ED appendages the complete ALR dataset suggests a functional consolidation into more rarely observed specialized roles such as secondary messenger signaling , RNA-binding , Ser phosphorylation and other enzymatic activities . Structural and biochemical analyses of the ALR RitR [23 , 24] , which regulates iron and oxidative stress in the human pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae , showed that in the absence of typical Asp phospho-regulation RitR likely retains the conserved Y/T-coupling mechanism of activation . Activation is shown to be prevented by an extensive \u2018Hydrophobic Gate\u2019 barrier comprised of residues within the canonical \u03b14-\u03b25 dimer interface . Changing the R-group in Gate residues to a methyl group ( Ala ) enabled RitR to actively dimerize through its \u03b14-\u03b25 face , bind DNA and modulate its target promoter activity ( the Pneumococcal Iron Uptake ( Piu ) transporter ) in vivo in the absence of an inducer . Collectively , this work presents the ALR domains and gives insight as to how they might work in the absence of typical phospho-regulatory mechanisms . \n To reveal the extent to which the REC domain family was missing the conserved phospho-accepting Asp , we downloaded the available ( 103 , 233 ) REC sequences from the Pfam database , and from this used a series of custom programs to extract a subset of 3 , 484 sequences lacking the phospho-regulated Asp residue . When redundant sequences were removed 74 , 816 unique REC-containing proteins were identified , 2 , 976 of which were missing or had substitutions at the conserved Asp position and indicated that as much as 4% of REC domains do not possess this conserved phosphorylatable residue . Given the frequency of these substitutions we renamed this subset of REC-type sequences Aspartate-Less Receivers ( or ALRs ) . The full dataset of ALR sequences and their accession numbers are given in S5 Table . ALR ED architectures , their accompanying Pfam ED accession numbers and phyla associated with these specific EDs are listed in S6 Table . Examination of our ALR dataset revealed several substitutions within predicted acidic triad positions , which includes the phosphorylatable Asp residue ( phospho-Asp ) . In typical REC sequences these three acidic residues facilitate the phospho-transfer reaction and then help to coordinate the newly formed phosphorylated active pocket . We found that the former phosphorylated Asp position is most frequently substituted with a Glu ( 26%; Fig 1a ) . In typical REC sequences when the phospho-Asp is replaced with Glu this can result in a constitutive phosphate-independent activation [31\u201333] . However , often Asp to Glu substitutions alone are not sufficient to produce such an effect , and therefore must be combined with other mutations to result in constitutive activity ( e . g . CheY [34] , PhoB [35] and Spo0A [36] ) . Similar to canonical REC domains , ALR constitutive activity might also be enabled by a change in the phosphorylatable Asp to Glu along with other key functional residues . For example in the case of ChxR , an ALR from Chlamydia trachomatis that contains a Glu in this position , when tested in vitro substitutions with Asp or Ala alone were not sufficient to abrogate its observed constitutive DNA-binding activity [37] . After Glu , the next most frequent substitutions at the conserved phospho-Asp are Asn ( 16% ) , Ser ( 15% ) , Gly ( 11% ) and Ala ( 9% ) ( Fig 1a ) , all of which have a representative characterized ALR and accompanying atomic structure ( except for Gly; Figs 1a and S2a; S3 Table ) . The remaining 23% of ALR phospho-Asp substitutions are far less frequent , some of which would be predicted to significantly change the typical REC active pocket hydrogen-bonding network . For example , we found 21 ALR sequences with a Pro substitution and another 23 sequences with either a Phe or Tyr aromatic . It is also worth noting that a substantial number of deletions in ALRs are observed in and around the former phospho-Asp position and other pocket residues , which would be predicted to result in changes to the typical REC domain pocket and/or overall structure ( Fig 1a ) . Although only two examples thus far of an ALR display an absent portion of its secondary structure within the pocket region ( ChxR [37] and HP1043 [38] ) , our data presented here suggest that such structural features might be more common in the ALR domain family than in typical RECs . Other more rarely used residues at the former phospho-Asp position include the positively charged ( basic ) amino acids of Arg , Lys and His , and when combined were found to constitute 4% of ALR phospho-Asp substitutions . One possibility is that such an alteration in charge or a similar change in any of the acidic triad residues might suffice to replace the missing active pocket metal ion ( yet to be identified in any ALR ) . The only amino acid that we did not find in place of the phospho-Asp was Trp , presumably due to the large steric clashes and instability that would likely ensue on the conserved REC three-dimensional architecture . In fact , only one Trp substitution was discovered among all three acid triad residues in ALRs . In general other hydrophobic residues ( Val , Ile , Leu , and Met ) were also rarely observed in place of any of the acidic triad amino acids ( Fig 1a ) . One exception to this rule appears to be Ala substitutions , where its single methyl side chain might disrupt the overall pocket structure to a lesser extent . In support , the described ALR FrzS structure from M . xanthus takes on a typical REC ( \u03b1/\u03b2 ) 5 fold where the phospho-Asp has been substituted with an Ala residue ( ref . [28] and S2a Fig ) . Another noteworthy observation was that the N-terminal acidic triad residue ( referred to here on as \u201cacidic triad-1\u201d , in RitR it is coordinate Glu9 ) is generally retained in ALRs ( 65% ) , whereas the second acid triad residue ( referred to here on as \u201cacidic triad-2\u201d , in RitR it is coordinate Lys10 ) is only an acidic residue in 29% of ALR sequences ( Fig 1a ) . Furthermore , the conserved Lys that helps coordinate the typical active pocket in REC domains was also largely retained in our ALR dataset ( 70% of sequences were basic at this position , in RitR it is coordinate Lys103 ) ( Fig 1a ) , suggesting that this residue and at least one acidic triad residue ( more often acidic triad-1 ) are maintained in ALR sequences . Whether these conservations are present to maintain structural integrity , protein function or both is at present unclear . We also examined the retention of Y/T-coupling residues in ALRs . Based on sequence alignment , available structural information and computational methods , Figs 1a , S1 , S2 , S3 and S3 Table collectively show that in the majority of cases Tyr/Phe ( Y/F ) and Thr/Ser ( S/T ) residues are present in ALRs at the expected positions ( 66% and 61% of the time , respectively ) . We also calculated that both a Y/F and S/T residue were present within the same ALR domain 44 . 5% of the time , which indicates that in ALRs the pairing of these residues is important , but to a lesser extent than canonical REC domains . Interestingly , if an S/T residue is present in an ALR sequence ( 61% ) then a Y/F is enriched for and appears 77% of the time , whereas if a Y/F is present ( 66% ) then an S/T residue appears at the same rate of 66% ( S3 Fig ) . We also observe that if one residue of the Y/T pair is present , then the other appears with a greater frequency than observed in the total ALR population ( for Y/F residues 11% more , and for S/T residues 5% more; S3 Fig ) . Combined , these observations suggest that in ALRs there is selective pressure to retain Y/T coupling residues , and to a certain extent ( 44 . 5% ) to keep them together in the same ALR . Importantly , our data also show that in ALRs it is more important to retain the Y/F residue than the S/T . One explanation for these data could be that to accommodate alternative functions assigned to the sometimes drastically changed ALR \u201cactive pockets\u201d , the S/T residue might have to change more frequently as it ( but not the Y/T partner ) is actually part of the altered catalytic core . Thus the S/T residue could be subjected to a greater evolutionary pressure to accommodate changes in the active pocket specific to a particular ALR function ( e . g . atomistic coordination of a bound small molecule ) . We observe that if one of the Y/T residues is present but not the other , then the substitution tends to be hydrophobic ( e . g . Val , Ile , Ala , Leu ) , and is infrequently charged ( RitR is one exception to this rule as it has an Asp residue in place of the Ser/Thr ) . The reason for these preferences remains to be determined . Taken together our results shown here allude to selective pressure in ALRs to retain Y/T-coupling residues , whose exact roles in signaling will likely have to be determined on an individual experimental basis . Intriguingly , we noticed that many of the substitutions in ALRs are capable of receiving PTMs other than Asp phosphorylation . The most common ALR substitution Glu ( Fig 1a ) has been shown as phosphorylatable [39] , however to the best of our knowledge there are no known examples of such modifications contributing to bacterial signaling . A more likely Glu-specific PTM would be methylation , as this modification has already been convincingly shown to alter bacterial protein signaling function [40] . The next most common substitution , Asn ( as seen in RitR; Fig 1a ) , has the potential to become modified by deamidation to a phosphorylatable Asp . Indeed it has been demonstrated that a REC domain harboring an Asn at the phosphorylatable position can undergo rapid reversion back to Asp [41] . How prevalent this reaction is in Asn-harboring ALRs , and if there are functional consequences of such chemical reversions has yet to be explored with RitR and other ALRs . We also noticed that the third most common ALR substitution at the conserved phospho-Asp site is Ser , and when combined with Thr and Tyr replacements these phosphorylatable residues together constitute 12% ( 556 sequences ) of all identified ALRs ( Fig 1a ) . These amino acids are all well known to hold potential for phospho-regulation by bacterial Ser-Thr [42] and Tyr [43] kinases . Additionally 63 ALR sequences harbor an Arg at the typical REC phospho-Asp position , an amino acid that also has the potential for phospho-regulation in prokaryotes ( by arginine-specific kinases and their cognate phosphatases [44 , 45] ) . We also noted that the seventh most common substitution at the phospho-Asp position was Cys , a residue capable of sensing environmental changes in the cellular redox state [46] . The 26 identified ALR sequences with a Cys substitution ( Cys-ALRs ) were further examined by generating an alignment ( Fig 2a ) and accompanying phylogenetic tree ( Fig 2b ) . Results revealed a distribution among both pathogenic and environmental microbes , many of which require strict oxygen conditions for growth ( e . g . Neptuniibacter caesariensis , Bifidobacterium gallicum and Geobacter metallireducens ) . Cys-ALR EDs were found to cluster into defined outputs and include a DsbA module from the marine aerobe N . caesariensis ( Fig 2b ) , a domain which can act as a disulfide oxidoreductase to ensure proper folding of proteins , especially excreted toxins and virulence factors [47] . Examination of the N . caesariensis genome revealed its encoded Cys-ALR to be adjacent to an operon containing glutathione S-transferase and a predicted NADPH ferrodoxin , enzymes that Dsb family members are often associated with [47] ( S7 Fig ) . Two other predicted genes encoding for Cys-ALRs from the marine bacteria Saccharophagus degradans and human pathogen Stenotrophomonas maltophilia were found adjacent to operons encoding iron/heme uptake systems ( S7 Fig ) . At present PTMs other than histidine kinase phosphorylation have not been described at the conserved REC domain phospho-Asp position . However , there is a plethora of literature describing alternative PTM regulation at other REC and associated ED residues by bacterial kinases [42 , 43 , 45 , 48] , as well as by Cys-mediated oxidation [46] . To the best of our knowledge the only example thus far of an atypical REC or ALR domain-containing protein being regulated through PTM modification at any residue is RitR ( Ser phosphorylation of the DNA-binding domain [24] ) . Although speculative , it is exciting to think that some ALRs might be regulated at their former phospho-Asp site by other PTMs ( e . g . Ser , Thr , Tyr , Arg phosphorylation or oxidation ) , whereby the newly-formed modified amino acid would be accommodated by a novel restructured ALR catalytic pocket . Future work will be required to make a definitive verdict on this subject . The phylogenetic numeric distribution of ALRs spanning all three domains of life is depicted in Fig 1b , and also displayed in Fig 1c as the average number of ALRs per Completed Genome ( CG ) categorized by phyla . Expanded bioinformatic statistics of typical REC domains versus that of ALRs are displayed in S1 Table , and ALR EDs and their association with specific phyla are given in S6 Table . For bacteria we found on average that any given CG possesses 2 ALR sequences , making ALRs a significant portion of the REC-like sequences in prokaryotes . In fact , only 5 out of the 45 known bacterial classes lacked ALRs ( the Mollicutes , Thermotogae , Dictyoglomia , Elusimicrobia and Synergistia; S1 Table ) . Although ALRs have thus far been predominantly characterized in pathogens , our data show they are numerically dominated by environmental bacteria , where greater selective pressures might be responsible for driving REC divergence to accommodate new input signals . We found that the highest average number of ALRs per CG were in the arsenic utilizing Chrystiogenetes ( 7 per CG ) , followed by the largely unstudied and mainly soil-dwelling Acidobacteria , the budding Plantomycetacia , the nitrite-oxidizing Nitrosprira and the phylum of Verrucomicrobia ( Clamydiae ) . Photosynthetic bacteria also were enriched for ALRs including the oxygenic photosynthetic Cyanobacteria and the Chloroflexi green non-sulfur bacteria ( Fig 1c and S1 Table ) . In general , the expansive phylum of Proteobacteria was found to contain an average of 2 . 2 ALRs per CG . However , the class of \u03b4-proteobacteria , which is largely composed of the related pathogenic species of Helicobacter and Campylobacter , was the most highly enriched in this taxon possessing approximately 5 ALRs per CG ( S1 Table ) . ALRs were found to comprise as much as 10% of the total REC sequences in Archaea , with the classes of Halobacteria and Methanomicrobia containing the highest numbers ( Fig 1b and S1 Table ) . Eukaryotes were also enriched in ALR sequences , which were found in yeast , fungi , ciliated protozoa , land plants and both green and red algae ( Fig 1b and S1 Table ) , but were most abundant in the Eurotiomycetes class of fungi ( 58 ALRs ) , the plant phylum of Streptophyta that includes vascular plants ( 88 ALRs ) , and finally the highly-evolved Liliopsida ( or lilly ) class of flowering plants ( 75 ALRs ) . A surprising finding was the presence of REC domains and some ALRs in ticks ( Arachnida , 2 RECs , 1 ALR ) , and the primitive invertebrate marine taxa of Anthozoa ( mainly sea urchins , 17 RECs , 1 ALR ) and Placozoa ( 4 RECs , 1 ALR ) , Placozoa being the most basal forms of invertebrates known [49] . As far as we are aware REC sequences and TCS systems have yet to be described in insects and animals . These sequences could be artefacts of bacterial contamination and/or endosymbionts [49] , but given the potential for expansion of TCS into the animal kingdom further investigation is warranted . To shed light on the enrichment of ALR ED sequences and how they might correlate with specific taxa , we extracted all ED statistics associated with canonical RECs and ALRs and cross-referenced these results with their taxonomic distribution . Results shown in Fig 1d and S2 Table indicate that the majority ( 53% ) of canonical REC sequences are either \u2018stand alone\u2019 REC domains , or possess C-terminal DNA-binding domain extensions , with the largest portion being OmpR/PhoB-type transcription factors such as RitR [50] , followed by the LuxR/GerE family . For most DNA-binding effectors , their percentage association with ALRs roughly paralleled the percentage associated with total REC sequences ( green versus black bars in Fig 1d ) . On the other hand , the less commonly seen DNA-binding EDs of YcbB ( or GlnL ) that possesses a novel helix-turn-helix motif , Myb domains that are dominant in plants , and the \u03b2-proteobacterial transcriptional regulator ( BetR ) family whose function ( s ) is currently unknown , were all considerably enriched in ALRs ( Fig 1d and S2 Table ) . The remaining 47% of ED sequences are diverse in their functional roles and phylogenetic distribution ( a complete listing can be seen in S6 Table ) . In particular , our data show that ALRs were highly enriched for when attached to RNA binding ( ANTAR ) motifs , cyclic-di GMP ( GGDEF ) signaling domains , the Constans-Constans\u2013like TOC1 ( CCT ) domains involved in controlling plant circadian rhythms , and modules containing both Ser-Thr kinase and phosphatase domains [17 , 18 , 30] ( Fig 1d and S2 Table ) . Also highly associated with ALRs were several enzymatic EDs that include pyruvate phosphate dikinases involved in plant C4 carbon metabolism , and HDOD phosphohydrolase domains whose exact functional role ( s ) is currently unknown [18] . These findings reveal that although ALRs exist in greater overall numbers within the more common ED families ( e . g . OmpR-type and LysR ) , they represent a larger percentage of more rare and less studied REC-associated effector outputs . To further illustrate this point the OmpR-type EDs are associated with the highest raw number of ALRs ( 609 sequences ) , yet this figure only constitutes 2% of all REC-[OmpR/PhoB winged helix-turn-helix] architectures . In contrast , out of only 24 REC-CbiA ( colbamin binding domain ) architectures known to exist , 11 are ALRs ( or 46%; Fig 1d; S2 Table ) . To the best of our knowledge , there are currently five available functionally-characterized prokaryotic ALR structures: ( i ) AmiR from Pseudomonas aeruginosa [17] , ( ii ) HP1043 from Helicobacter pylori [25] , ( iii ) ChxR from Chlamydia trachomatis [26 , 27] , ( iv ) FrzS from Myxococcus xanthus [28] and ( v ) KiaA from Synechococcus elongatus [29] . However , our computational searches revealed an additional 5 unpublished and uncharacterized ALR structures that have been deposited in the RCSB protein databank ( www . rcsb . org; PDB IDs 2B4A , 2QZJ , 2ZAY , 3HV2 , and 3KTO ) . For comparison available ALR structures and their known attributes are listed in S3 Table , and an alignment of these sequences and structural comparisons are shown in S2 Fig . To add to the understanding of how ALRs are able to function in the absence of a phospho-Asp signal , and to decipher if RitR parallels these previously solved ALR as well as canonical REC structures , we obtained a crystal structure to 1 . 6 \u00c5 resolution of the ALR ( REC ) domain of RitR ( RitRALR; PDB ID 4LZL; Table 1 ) , responsible for regulating oxidative stress and iron uptake in the important human pathogen S . pneumoniae [23 , 24] . As implied by its crystallization in the P1 space group , which lacks crystallographic symmetry elements , RitRALR is monomeric and suggests that this structure could represent an inactive state of the protein [4] . The overall fold of the RitR structure shares the ( \u03b1/\u03b2 ) 5 topology common to the OmpR/PhoB family of response regulators [4 , 50 , 51] ( Fig 3a ) . One notable exception is a defined kink in the \u03b14 helix , which we have subdivided into \u03b14a that interacts with the would-be catalytic pocket in RitR , and \u03b14b that likely interacts with helix 8 of the DBD to preclude its association with DNA [15] ( Fig 3b and 3c ) . A search of available ALR and typical REC atomic structures revealed only two others that exhibit a similar \u03b14 helical bend: PhoP from Mycobacterium tuberculosis [52] ( PDB ID 3r0j ) and DrrD from Thermotoga maritima [53] ( PDB ID 1KGS ) . Similar to other ALRs and atypical REC sequences , the would-be \u201cactive site\u201d of RitR harbors several divergent substitutions relative to classical REC domains ( Figs 1a , S1 and S2 ) , all of which gave well-defined electron density for analysis ( Fig 4a ) . First , the phosphorylatable Asp position in RitR is substituted with asparagine ( Asn53 ) , thus defining it as a bona fide ALR . Although Asn53 is in approximately the same position as its more canonical Asp-containing counterparts , the conformation differs by a roughly 90\u00b0 rotation of the \u03c71 angle where it now hydrogen bonds to acidic triad-1 ( Glu9; Figs 3b and S2 ) , which in typical REC domains binds the Mg2+ ion required for the phospho-transfer . When compared with other ALR structures we see that the acid triad-1 position and conserved would-be active pocket Lys ( RitR coordinate Lys103 ) almost without exception make electrostatic interactions to presumably help stabilize the ALR \u2018active\u2019 pocket , with the residue that replaces the phospho-Asp site also participating when side chain hydrogen bonding is possible ( S2 Fig ) . Conversely , the acidic triad-2 position side chain only forms a potential hydrogen bond with other ALR acid triad residues in the case of AmiR ( S2 Fig ) . These observations suggest that ALRs have largely retained an acidic residue at the acidic triad-1 position ( 66% ) and a basic residue at the conserved Lys position ( 70% ) to maintain the overall structure of a typical REC domain , while the acid triad-2 remains much more variable ( only 29% conserved in ALRs; Fig 1a ) . Of note , in many ALRs such as RitR , HP1043 and 3KTO acidic triad-2 is replaced by a positively charged ( or basic ) residue , for example in RitR by Lys10 ( Figs 4a and 4b and S2 ) . This normally invariant position of the classical REC domain , located between the \u03b21 strand and \u03b11 helix ( L\u03b21\u03b11 ) , is crucial in coordinating the active pocket metal and phospho-Asp residue in typical REC sequences . One hypothesis is that such a change to a positive charge might act to take the place of the normally present positively-charged Mg2+ ion , and therefore serve to maintain the structural integrity of the overall REC/ALR fold . In RitR we see that the Lys substitution at acidic triad-2 dramatically alters the position of the entire L\u03b21\u03b11 loop relative to typical REC domains such that the cleft , which would normally receive the metal ion , collapses and interrupts what would usually be in typical REC structures a continuous electronegative surface ( Fig 4c and 4d ) . Whatever the reason for these observed changes , our computational and structural data presented here point to ALRs retaining at least one of the two remaining acidic triad residues ( usually acidic triad-1 ) , and the conserved Lys-Pro motif , which together help to maintain the classical three-dimensional REC structure in the absence of the usually bound metal ion and typical Asp phosphorylation . Conversely , variation seen within the other two acidic triad residues ( the changed phospho-Asp position and acidic triad-2 ) might be tailored to individual ALR mechanisms . A distinguishing feature of the RitR structure is the \u03b14 helix , which is broken at residues 88\u201390 into two smaller helices ( \u03b14a and \u03b14b; Fig 3a\u20133c ) . A careful examination of the available REC structures reveals variations in this region from a straight helical extension . However , few REC \u03b14 structures are as profusely interrupted as the RitR \u03b14 , where the measured angle between the helical axes of \u03b14a and \u03b14b is approximately 100\u00b0 . Situated on the \u03b14 are three hydrophobic residues ( Leu86 , Leu90 , and Val93 ) that pack against the central \u03b2-sheet and make van der Waals contacts with Val54 ( L\u03b23\u03b13 ) , Ile79 ( \u03b24 ) , Ala97 ( L\u03b14\u03b25 ) , Tyr100 ( \u03b25 ) and Tyr102 ( \u03b25 ) to form what we name here the \u2018Hydrophobic Gate\u2019 ( or \u2018Gate\u2019 residues; Fig 3b and 3c ) . The Gate creates an obvious mechanical barrier to impede the reorientation of Tyr100 ( i . e . Y/T-coupling ) , which in REC domains usually results in \u03b14- \u03b25- \u03b15 dimer association and DNA binding [10 , 11] . In RitR we noticed that the position of residue Leu90 appeared especially important in that it directly blocks Tyr100 from entering the Gate and also holds the helix 4 kink together through a hydrogen bond ( 2 . 7 \u00c5 ) to the carbonyl of Glu87 . As a result , the side chain of the Tyr100 dimerization ( Y/T-coupling ) trigger is oriented outward to extend into the solvent\u2014away from the \u03b14-\u03b25- \u03b15 face of the protein as observed in the typical monomeric , inactive REC conformation [7 , 9] . This positioning might explain why in the case of RitR we observe a predominantly monomeric state in both crystalline and solution environments ( see below ) . The outward-facing Tyr100 rotomer is also enforced by Gate residue Leu86 , which in RitR occupies the space normally filled by the Y/T-coupling Thr or Ser residue in the unphosphorylated state . Instead , the equivalent of this residue in RitR ( Asp81 ) orients itself towards Asn53 , which is reminiscent of the active or inward-facing rotomer when typical REC domains are phosphorylated . Thus in our RitR structure Y/T-coupling is effectively trapped in an \u2018uncoupled\u2019 intermediate state , whereby Asp81 is in the \u201cin\u201d orientation and Tyr100 in the \u201cout\u201d orientation . A survey of the available ALR structures reveals that the RitR Tyr100 outward-facing rotomer is not the norm . In fact , all but one currently available ALR structure exhibits an inward-facing conformation , which could explain why several ALR structures with this rotomer are dimeric ( i . e . AmiR ( PDB ID 1QO0 ) , HP1043 ( PDB ID 2PLN ) , PDB ID 2QZJ , PDB ID 2ZAY and PDB ID 3HV2; S2 Fig ) , with some demonstrating DNA binding and activity in vivo without phospho-Asp driven changes influencing their conformational equilibrium states ( e . g . HP1043 ( PDB: 2PLN ) [38] and FrzS ( PDB ID 2I6F ) [28] ) . However , in the case of ChxR this trend is contradicted . The available structure reveals that the conserved ChxR Tyr is not only found facing outward , but also participates in dimer formation ( S2 Fig; [37] ) , reinforcing the notion that an observed outward Tyr rotomer in REC/ALR domains does not always result in a monomeric quarternary state [19] . Interestingly , recent data from Kern and colleagues show that the conserved Tyr/Phe and Ser/Thr pair in the response regulator NtrC operate on different timescales in solution , and specifically that the Tyr/Phe does not participate in the active conformation of this protein [54] . Although we did observe that in RitR Tyr100 was important for DNA-binding and in vivo repression of piu ( Fig 5 ) , its precise role in RitR activation still remains to be determined . To date it remains enigmatic as to how both atypical REC domains and ALRs are activated in the absence of phosphorylation . Do these proteins exhibit equilibrium between active and inactive states and are driven to activation by an input signal through their Y/T-coupling residues ? [5] Or are they instead mainly constitutive and impervious to signaling inputs and resulting downstream structural changes ? Recent data has revealed that the activity of several ALRs as well as canonical REC domains can be modulated through ligand or PTM mediated signals other than Asp phosphorylation , which includes Ser/Thr phosphorylation [22 , 42] and direct binding by small molecule activators [20 , 55] . The observed conservation of the canonical REC Y/T-coupling residues in ALRs shown here ( Figs 1a , S1 , and S3 ) suggests that although the ALR inducer can be variable , after this signal induction takes place in many cases some version of the Y/T-coupling relay and dimerization mechanism may work to modulate ALR activity . At present , it still remains unclear as to why most ALRs have retained these residues and have thus far shown to be functionally important in vivo in the few examples available ( ref . [28] and these studies ) . The unique uncoupled state of the RitR Y/T ( Y/D in the case of RitR ) pair in our structure presented an opportunity to explore the activation of an ALR in the absence of the inducer . To attempt to force RitR to dimerize in the absence an upstream signal we introduced substitutions within divergent acidic triad residues Lys10 and Asn53 ( Fig 5a in cyan ) , Y/T-coupling residues Tyr100 and Asp81 ( Fig 5a in orange ) , and Gate residues Leu86 , Leu90 , Val93 , Tyr102 and Phe96 ( Fig 5a in green ) . Purified RitR mutant and wild-type proteins ( S6 Fig ) were then assessed for their oligomeric state via Size Exclusion Chromatography ( SEC ) and the ability to bind to pre-defined RitR target DNA [23] by Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays ( EMSAs ) . Furthermore , to examine the contributions of these individual residues to the RitR mediated repression of piu iron transporter expression in vivo [23 , 24] , we created \u03b2-galactosidase reporter strains in S . pneumoniae where we could measure Piu promoter ( Ppiu ) activity in response to the same RitR isogenic variants ( see Methods section for details ) . Results shown in Fig 5b\u20135e indicate that mutagenesis of the RitR acidic triad residue coordinates Lys10 and Asn53 had no effect on the ability of RitR to bind DNA , form a dimer in vitro or modulate Ppiu activity in vivo . These data suggest that similar to other functionally-characterized ALRs [25 , 27 , 28] and also atypical REC domains that possess the phosphorylatable Asp [9] , that at least under these tested conditions RitR does not rely on its acidic triad residue positions to function . Conversely , when Y/T-coupling residues Tyr100 or Asp81 were replaced with Ala we observed DNA binding with as little as 0 . 22 \u03bcM of RitR in EMSA experiments ( Fig 5c and 5d ) . This was significant in that previous to these experiments DNA binding with full-length RitR ( RitRFL ) was unobtainable without first removing the ALR ( REC ) domain ( wild-type sample Fig 5c and 5d and ref . [23] ) , a phenomenon likely due the restraint of the helix-turn-helix motif by intramolecular ALR-DBD domain contacts in the absence of an inducer [19] . SEC experimentation of the Asp81 mutant revealed a split peak profile , neither of which perfectly aligned with the expected monomer or dimer molecular weights , whereas the Tyr100 mutant was mostly monomeric ( Fig 5b ) . However , in vivo results show that Asp81 and Tyr100 are required for full repression of piu transcription ( Fig 5e ) . As REC/ALR dimers are normally the \u2018activated\u2019 form of the protein that binds DNA , the SEC results are apparently in conflict with the EMSA and in vivo data . A likely explanation is that in the absence of DNA mutations within Asp81 and Tyr100 destabilize RitR such that it is unable to form a proper dimer in vitro . Experimental support for this hypothesis includes our SEC analysis of Y/T-coupling residues Asp81 and Tyr100 in both RitRFL and RitRALR constructs , as well as our accompanying RitRALR HSQC spectra , where mutations within these residues produces protein with enhanced aggregation and heterogeneic properties ( S4 Fig ) . In contrast to mutagenesis of the RitR Y/T-coupling residues , substitutions within Gate residues Leu86 and Leu90 yielded well-behaved protein that resulted in DNA binding , clear dimer formation in vitro and an enhancement effect on Ppiu activity in vivo ( Fig 5 ) . An Ala substitution of Gate residue Val93 alone did not influence RitR DNA binding , but was sufficient to produce more dimer in solution ( Fig 5b ) . However , when the Val93 mutant was combined with a Leu86 mutation , we then observed a large shift in equilibrium towards the dimeric form of RitRFL when compared to the SEC profile of either of these Gate mutations alone ( Fig 5b ) . The Leu86/Val93 double mutant also exhibited DNA binding and modified Ppiu activity in vivo ( Fig 5e ) . Mutation of Gate residue Phe96 produced a marked loss of promoter repression in vivo , however in vitro this mutant displayed a heterogeneous SEC profile and no observed DNA binding activity , suggesting that this residue might be crucial to protein stability . On the other hand a substitution at the Gate residue Tyr102 did not have an effect on RitR DNA binding , modulation of Ppiu activity in vivo or result in a clear dimeric state in solution ( Fig 5 ) . From these experiments we can conclude that substitutions within key Gate residues Leu86 , Leu90 , and Val93 results in the enhancement of dimerization and DNA-binding in vitro , and in vivo these same mutations cause a derepression and/or activation of Ppiu ( Fig 5e ) . However , these in vitro and in vivo data are seemingly in conflict , as RitR is classically known as a repressor of piu transcription [23 , 24 , 56] , and thus enhanced DNA binding would be expected to result in maintained Ppiu repression in vivo , and not the observed increase seen in Ppiu activity ( Fig 5e ) . In response , recent data from our lab has shown that RitR regulation is much more complex than this simple paradigm , where other PTMs play a pivotal role in its regulatory effects , including Ser-Thr phosphorylation and oxidation ( [24] and Wright et al . under review ) . Moreover , we have found that RitR is also able to act as an activator of piu transcription when occupying different Ppiu transcriptional regulatory sites , which here we have shown can be artificially induced through Y/T-coupling and Gate mutations ( Fig 5e ) . Future studies will have to determine how PTMs , possibly other transcription factors and changing environmental conditions precisely contribute to the complexity of RitR promoter occupancy and transcriptional control in vivo . Although we observed clear RitR dimerization with substitutions in Gate residues , we wanted to know if the RitR dimer interface was facilitated through the typical \u03b14-\u03b25-\u03b15 face used by regular REC domains and other known ALRs ( [27 , 38]; S2 Fig; S3 Table ) . To answer this question we collected three-dimensional NMR data with [U-15N , 13C] RitR . The NMR spectra displayed excellent peak quality and distribution that would be predicted of a monomeric RitRALR , and were assigned to completion . Next we produced purified 15N-labeled protein of the Ala substitution mutants ( ALR domain only , or RitRALR ) of Leu86 , Leu90 , Asp81 and Tyr100 . When SEC was used to analyze their oligomeric states as expected the wild-type was predominantly monomeric ( Figs 6a and S4a ) . Conversely , when Gate residue mutants were similarly examined ( Leu86 and Leu90 ) they were almost entirely dimeric , with the Leu90 mutant showing a small monomeric peak , and the Leu86 mutant displaying more heterogeneity in this region with two peaks ( Figs 6a and S4a ) . Paralleling the data of full-length protein SEC experiments , the Y/T-coupling residue mutants were more poorly behaved than Gate substituted versions . SEC data showed the Tyr100 RitRALR mutant to be highly unstable , where most of the protein was found within the void volume ( S4a Fig ) . Moreover the Asp81 mutant formed mainly aggregates after initial Ni2+ affinity purification and was therefore not examined further . These results suggest that the RitR DNA-binding domain aids in the stability of the protein in the active form , which could be further stabilized by the presence of its target DNA sequence as is often seen with helix-turn-helix containing transcription factors . NMR data generally reflected what we observed by SEC , where a new set of peaks likely representing the chemically distinct dimeric state of RitR could be detected in the Leu86 and Leu90 mutants ( Figs 6b and S4b ) . Although not identical , the Leu86 and Leu90 mutant spectra exhibited considerable spectral overlap ( S4b Fig ) , which suggests that these two mutants both form similar dimeric structures . Differences between these spectra could be due the chemical shift contributions within the immediate chemical environment of the mutated residues . When compared to the wild-type HSQC plot , some of the amides from the Leu86/Leu90 mutant samples were found to completely disappear , which we deemed to be in very different chemical environments and contributing to the dimer interface , while other shifts remained in similar chemical environments to varying degrees ( Figs 6b and S4b ) . To better understand what amino acids were changing their immediate chemical environments within the RitR dimer , we superimposed the wild-type HSQC plot over the most homogeneous mutant sample ( Leu90; Fig 6b ) . Residues that experienced the largest differences in the HSQC spectra were then mapped onto the RitRALR crystal structure using a color-coded chemical shift intensity scheme ( Fig 6c ) . The largest changes in chemical shifts ( i . e . the peaks in question were either severely diminished in intensity or had completely disappeared in the Leu90 sample ) were mostly centered around the \u03b14-\u03b25 face of the protein , which participates in the canonical dimerization region in other ALR/REC structures . In addition to the backbone amide chemical shifts from residues Gln87 and Gln94 being completely absent from the Leu86 and Leu90 mutant HSQC spectra , their respective NH2 side chain chemical shifts were also missing ( Fig 6b ) . Indeed , the Gln87 and Gln94 side chains , both of which project into the solvent in the \u2018inactive\u2019 monomeric crystal structure , are predicted to form a component of the \u03b14-\u03b25 dimer interface according to other dimeric ALR and typical REC available atomic models , and in our dimeric RitR atomic model ( see below ) . Collectively these results show that Gate residues Leu90 and Leu86 stabilize the inactive form of the \u03b14 , and suggest that Gln87/Gln94 participate in the RitR dimer . Other regions of the protein experienced little change save the N-termini of the \u03b11 and \u03b12 helices ( Fig 6c ) . Our results show that similar to other REC and ALR domains , the \u03b14-\u03b25/Gate region of RitR is likely the major component involved in dimerization of the protein . The observed changes in the \u03b11 and \u03b12 could be explained by another minor and unidentified dimer species in slow exchange with the major \u03b14- \u03b25 dimeric species , or possible intra-protein rearrangements resulting from the larger chemical shift changes in the \u03b14-\u03b25/Gate region . Interestingly , in the Leu86 or Leu90 mutants the \u03b15 helix that would normally complete a canonical dimer face exhibited very little changes in chemical environment , suggesting that this helix does not play a major role in RitR dimer formation . Indeed , the degree of the REC/ALR dimeric interface can vary considerably [15 , 16 , 37] . In support of this RitR \u201c\u03b14-\u03b25 only\u201d dimer hypothesis , we found one other ALR structure ( PDB ID 3HV2; S5a Fig ) and two canonical FixJ regulators ( [57 , 58]; S5a Fig ) , which all use a \u03b14-\u03b25 dimer interface without \u03b15 participation . Furthermore , when we generated an atomic model of the active RitR dimer based on the structure of the FixJ homolog DctD [57 , 58] we observed that the amino acids which exhibited the greatest changes in chemical shift/intensities aligned at the \u03b14-\u03b25 dimer interface and were predicted to use the expected crucial Gate residues Leu86 , Leu90 and Val93 help form the outward facing inter-protomor contacts ( S5b Fig ) . These contacts also included the two Gln residues ( Gln87 and Gln94 ) whose chemical shifts completely disappeared from their wild-type positions in our Leu86 and Leu90 mutant RitR constructs ( Figs 6b , S4b , and S5b ) . Future three-dimensional structures and further biochemical and genetic analyses will be required to determine the precise contribution of individual residues to dimer formation . Taken together our structural , biochemical and genetic experiments shown here suggest that similar to other REC and ALR domains , RitR uses its conserved Y/T-coupling residues in concert with its Hydrophobic Gate to initiate and form an active dimer ( Figs 6 and S5 ) . However , although RitR likely dimerizes at the same face as typical REC domains , we observe that similar to the ALR 3HV2 and FixJ-type transcriptions factors it uses only the \u03b14- \u03b25 to facilitate this interaction . We found that Gate residues Leu86 and Leu90 were especially important in activation of the dimeric form of RitR , and likely involves a repositioning of the conserved Tyr residue from the outward to inward rotomer . Previous studies of typical REC domains have noted the conservation of hydrophobic residues within the \u03b14-\u03b25 Gate , most notably at the RitR Leu90 and Val93 positions , with Leu86 being more variable ( see S1 and S2b Figs ) . In fact in one study it was found that 261 of 269 surveyed OmpR/PhoB-type response regulators possessed a hydrophobic residue at the RitR Leu90 coordinate [53] . In ALRs this residue is also highly conserved as a hydrophobic amino acid ( S1 Fig ) . A survey of the available ALR atomic structures reveals that Leu90 and Val93 are hydrophobic residues in 7/10 and 9/10 of the sequences , respectively ( S2b Fig ) . Moreover , we found that in ALR structures where dimers were available ( ChxR ( PDB ID 3Q7R ) , HP1043 ( PDB ID 2PLN ) , AmiA ( PDB ID 1QO0 ) , PDB ID 2QZJ and PBD ID 2ZAY ) , the equivalent coordinates of Leu86 , Leu90 and Val93 in all cases participated in their respective dimer interfaces , including in our RitR activated dimer model structure based on DctD ( S5b Fig ) . Combined with our computational data showing their conservation ( Figs 1 and S3 ) , these observations further suggest that many ALRs use some form of Y/T-coupling to modulate their activity , and that Gate residues might have a more general function in both canonical REC and ALR domains to \u2018fine tune\u2019 the rotomeric states of the conserved Tyr trigger . Additional support comes through studies from Alber and colleagues [28] . They show that similar to most other ALR structures , the ALR FrzS has an inward or \u201cactivated\u201d Tyr rotomer . When mutated little difference was observed in protein structure , however in vivo data demonstrated a similar phenotype to a full frzS deletion and suggests that FrzS might use a \u2018reverse\u2019 version of Y/T coupling [28] . Considering that most ALR structures solved thus far show their Tyr trigger in the inward active state ( S2 Fig ) , this mechanism could be more widespread within the ALR domain family . At present we can only speculate that ALRs use a version of the Y/T-coupling mechanism of activation , which is for now based on the conservation of Gate and Y/T coupling residues , and data from only two existing examples ( i . e . RitR and FtzS ) . Now that the entire available ALR dataset has been identified ( S5 Table ) , we will be able to more comprehensively study the ALR family of signaling domains to aid in our understanding of their diverse mechanistic roles they play in nature , and importantly how they function in the absence of histidine phosphorylation . \n Cultures of pneumococcus were grown overnight from frozen ( -80\u00b0C ) stocks in CAT medium ( 0 . 5% ( w/v ) tryptone , 1% ( w/v ) casein digest , 0 . 1% ( w/v ) yeast extract , and 5 mg/L choline ) containing 0 . 02% ( w/v ) glucose and the appropriate antibiotics at 37\u00b0C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator . The following day cultures were then diluted 1:10 in Todd Hewitt broth medium ( Becton Dickinson ) supplemented with 1% ( w/v ) yeast extract ( THY ) containing appropriate antibiotics , and the cell density measured periodically at 600 nm using a Biomate 3 spectrophotometer ( Thermo Scientific , Waltham , MA ) . DNA was transformed using the Competence Stimulating Peptide CSP-1 , a generous gift from Donald Morrison , University of Illinois-Chicago . For transformations , S . pneumoniae cells were inoculated from frozen stocks into THY broth containing the appropriate selection antibiotics and cultured to early exponential phase ( i . e . an A590 of 0 . 01\u20130 . 03 ) . At this time 100 ng of CSP-1 and 100\u2013200 ng of DNA were then added to a 0 . 5 ml volume of the culture . The transformation reactions were then placed back into the CO2 chamber and incubated for at least another 2 hours before being plated onto Tryptic Soy Blood Agar ( TSBA ) plates ( Becton Dickinson , Oxford , UK ) containing 4% ( v/v ) defibrinated sheep blood ( Rockland Immunochemicals , Gilbertsville , PA ) with appropriate antibiotics and grown at 37\u00b0C under 5% CO2 until resistant colonies appeared . The kanamycin ( Kan ) cassette to delete ritR was selected with 200\u2013300 \u03bcg/ml Kan , and the erythromycin ( Erm ) cassette to complement with ritR variants was selected with 1 \u03bcg/ml Erm . Strains of E . coli were cultured for plasmid purification overnight with aeration in a 37\u00b0C incubator in standard lysogeny broth ( LB ) medium supplemented with appropriate antibiotics: 50 \u03bcg/ml spectinomycin , 34 \u03bcg/ml chloramphenicol ( Cam ) , or 50 \u03bcg/ml ampicillin ( Amp ) or the more stable Amp substitute carbenicillin ( Carb ) . Crystals of RitRALR were grown by the hanging-drop , vapor diffusion method . Drops were comprised of equal parts protein solution ( 5\u201310 mg/ml RitRALR in 10 mM BIS-TRIS propane , pH 7 . 5 ) and crystallization solution ( 20\u201325% ( w/v ) polyethylene glycol ( PEG ) 3350 , 2 . 5 mM magnesium formate , and 20 mM TRIS , pH 8 . 5 ) . Long , narrow rods appeared after several days . Crystals were prepared for flash-cooling by sequential soaks in solution containing 30% PEG ( w/v ) 3350 , 5 mM magnesium formate , 20 mM TRIS ( pH 8 . 5 ) , and 5 , 10 , or 20% glycerol ( v/v ) . Flash-cooling was accomplished by plunging glycerol-soaked crystals into liquid nitrogen . Diffraction data were collected from a 20 x 20 x 200 \u03bcm crystal at beam line 21-ID-D of the Life Science Collaborative Access Team at the Advanced Photon Source ( APS ) , Chicago , Illinois . Data were processed with HKL2000 [67] . Initial phases were obtained by molecular replacement using the program PHASER [68] in the CCP4 suite [69] and the structure of the PhoP REC domain ( PDB ID 1MVO , ref . [70] ) as the starting model . The initial electron density maps were poor . Automatic rebuilding using the AutoBuild program [71] in the PHENIX suite [72] improved the phases considerably , allowing approximately 95% of the polypeptide to be modeled , albeit with several discontinuities . This improved model was then subjected to iterative cycles of maximum likelihood refinement in the program PHENIX . refine [73] and manual model building in COOT [74] . After completing the polypeptide , riding hydrogen atoms were added to the model with REDUCE [75] , and ordered solvent molecules were added with PHENIX . refine . At this point , the crystallographic and free R factors converged at 0 . 160 and 0 . 195 , respectively . Subsequent refinement of anisotropic motion in the form of TLS parameters for groups identified by the TLSMD server [76] resulted in significant reductions in both R factors ( Rcryst = 0 . 146 , Rfree = 0 . 167 ) . After final adjustments to the model , including the addition of glycerol molecules from the cryo-protectant solution , the R factors converged at their final values of Rcryst = 0 . 136 and Rfree = 0 . 157 . Model quality was assessed using the comprehensive validation tools implemented in the PHENIX suite , including MolProbity [77] . Data collection and refinement statistics are presented in Table 1 . [U-13C , 15N] RitRALR or [U-15N] RitR variants were resuspended in a buffer containing 40 mM 2H-Tris-HCl pH 7 . 6 , 300 mM NaCl , 10% ( v/v ) D2O , and 0 . 02% ( v/v ) NaN3 and then used to collect 15N-edited , 13C-aliphatic-edited , and 13C-aromatic-edited NOESY spectra on a 600MHz Bruker Advance spectrometer at 25\u00b0C . Additional spectra were collected to enable the three-dimensional unambiguous assignments of backbone and side chain resonances of the wild-type sample that included 1H-15N-HSQC , HNCO , HNCA , HN ( CO ) CA , HN ( CO ) CACB , HNCACB , C ( CO ) NH , H ( CCO ) NH , HBHA ( CO ) NH , and HCCH-TOCSY experiments . 1H-15N-heteronuclear NOE experiments were also collected to determine the relative order or flexibility of protein on the nanosecond-picosecond timescales ( for further discussion of many of these experiments see ref . [78] . Backbone resonances were initially assigned by automation using the program GARANT [79] and were confirmed by manual inspection in XEASY [80] . Side chains were assigned using GARANT\u2019s genPeaks command for the HCCH-TOCSY spectrum , and side chain assignments were edited and corrected manually in XEASY . Aromatic protons were assigned manually in XEASY from the 13C-aromatic-edited NOESY spectrum . SEC experiments were carried out using an Agilent 1220 Compact HPLC equipped with a 250 x 4 . 6 mm BioBasic SEC-300A column equilibrated with 50 mM TRIS pH 8 . 0 , 150 mM NaCl and 10 mM DTT . The column was calibrated with the Gel Filtration Molecular Weight Marker kit from Sigma-Aldrich ( Cytochrome C ( 12 . 4 kDa ) , Carbonic Anhydrase ( 29 kDa ) , Bovine Serum Albumin ( 66 kDa ) , and Sweet Potato Amylase ( 200 kDa ) ) . The wild-type and mutant forms of RitRFL protein were pre-treated with 10 mM DTT , injected ( 5 \u03bcl ) onto the column and separated at a flow rate of 0 . 5 ml/min at ambient temperature . EMSA analysis was conducted using HEX ( Hexachlorofluorocein ) -labeled double stranded DNA representing the RitR 33-mer Binding Site 2 ( BS2 ) within the Piu promoter [23] . The probes were made by combining at room temperature a forward primer containing the HEX label ( BS2-HEX-F ) with a complementary and unlabeled reverse primer ( BS2\u2013R ) ( S4 Table ) . EMSAs were carried out in a final volume of 20 \u03bcl containing: 20 mM HEPES pH 7 . 2 , 5 mM MgCl2 , 1 mM CaCl2 , 0 . 1 mM EDTA , 10 mM DTT , 10% ( v/v ) glycerol , 0 . 5 \u03bcM of the double stranded BS2 or control DNA oligos , 800 ng of Poly ( deoxyinosinic-deoxycytidylic ) acid ( poly dI-dC ) and RitRFL protein at concentrations between 0 to 6 . 6 \u03bcM . EMSA reaction mixtures were incubated at room temperature for 10 minutes prior to resolution by 4% non-denaturing 1XTAE ( Tris-Acetate EDTA ) PAGE . Gels were visualized at 560 nm using a FLA3000 FujiFilm imager . For quantification of RitRFL DNA affinity to BS2 ( Fig 4d ) , a fixed concentration of RitRFL protein ( 2 . 2 \u03bcM ) was used in a reaction with HEX-labeled BS2 as above . EMSAs were done in triplicate and quantified using ImageJ [81] .", "headings": ["Abstract", "Introduction", "Results and Discussion", "Methods"], "keywords": [], "id": "journal.ppat.1004795"}
{"lay_summary": "There is increasing interest in oncolytic viruses ( OVs ) , following the approval of OncovexGM-CSF , and the success of a number of them in clinical trials . Most OVs , particularly the oHSVs , are attenuated to varying degree . In contrast , the tropism-retargeted oHSVs are fully-virulent , highly effective oncolytic agents , and appear to be highly safe in mice . Up to now , it was unknown how efficacious the retargeted oHSVs are as immunotherapeutic agents . Here , the demonstration that they elicit local immune response and systemic therapy vaccine effects opens the possibility that the fully-virulent retargeted oHSVs may be highly efficacious oncolytic-immunotherapeutic agents .", "article": "Oncolytic herpes simplex viruses ( oHSVs ) showed efficacy in clinical trials and practice . Most of them gain cancer-specificity from deletions/mutations in genes that counteract the host response , and grow selectively in cancer cells defective in anti-viral response . Because of the deletions/mutations , they are frequently attenuated or over-attenuated . We developed next-generation oHSVs , which carry no deletion/mutation , gain cancer-specificity from specific retargeting to tumor cell receptors\u2014e . g . HER2 ( human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ) \u2014hence are fully-virulent in the targeted cancer cells . The type of immunotherapy they elicit was not predictable , since non-attenuated HSVs induce and then dampen the innate response , whereas deleted/attenuated viruses fail to contrast it , and since the retargeted oHSVs replicate efficiently in tumor cells , but spare other cells in the tumor . We report on the first efficacy study of HER2-retargeted , fully-virulent oHSVs in immunocompetent mice . Their safety profile was very high . Both the unarmed R-LM113 and the IL-12-armed R-115 inhibited the growth of the primary HER2-Lewis lung carcinoma-1 ( HER2-LLC1 ) tumor , R-115 being constantly more efficacious . All the mice that did not die because of the primary treated tumors , were protected from the growth of contralateral untreated tumors . The long-term survivors were protected from a second contralateral tumor , providing additional evidence for an abscopal immunotherapeutic effect . Analysis of the local response highlighted that particularly R-115 unleashed the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment , i . e . induced immunomodulatory cytokines , including IFN\u03b3 , T-bet which promoted Th1 polarization . Some of the tumor infiltrating cells , e . g . CD4+ , CD335+ cells were increased in the tumors of all responders mice , irrespective of which virus was employed , whereas CD8+ , Foxp3+ , CD141+ were increased and CD11b+ cells were decreased preferentially in R-115-treated mice . The durable response included a breakage of tolerance towards both HER2 and the wt tumor cells , and underscored a systemic immunotherapeutic vaccine response . \n Oncolytic viruses ( OVs ) meet the need for novel anticancer agents characterized by low toxicity and low negative impact on the quality of life of patients [1\u20134] . Oncolytic herpes simplex viruses ( oHSVs ) stand for their efficacy in a number of clinical applications [5 , 6] . The most successful oHSV , OncovexGM-CSF , was approved against metastatic melanoma [7 , 8] . The Clinical trials . gov website lists 22 open or recently completed trials with oHSVs [9\u201313] . Much of the current interest in OVs stems from their immunotherapeutic properties . Thus , oHSVs , and OVs in general , boost the immune response to the tumor , exert a therapeutic vaccine effect with no requirement for the identification of the tumor-specific or patient-specific neoantigens [14\u201317] . In combination with checkpoint inhibitors ( CPIs ) , they enhance the efficacy of the blockade therapy [18\u201321] . They can be engineered to express anti-checkpoint antibodies [22] . The oHSVs in clinical practice or trials are attenuated to varying degrees , and gain their cancer specificity from the attenuation [3 , 5 , 23 , 24] . In essence , safety was achieved at the expense of virulence . The attenuated oHSVs infect preferentially , but not exclusively , the cancer cells . Attenuation was attained through genetic engineering , as in the \u0394\u03b3134 . 5 viruses , including OncovexGM-CSF , or through natural mutations [23 , 25 , 26] . In some examples , multiple deletions resulted in high attenuation , to the point that oHSVs replicated to limited extent even in the tumor cells [27] and were scarcely efficacious as single agents . In OncovexGM-CSF , the attenuation is reversed by the immediate early expression of US11 , a viral protein which counteracts protein kinase R [28] . To circumvent the attenuation effects , OVs are employed as vectors for the transgenic expression of cytokines or CPIs . Indeed , the first cytokine-expressing oHSV was designed by Martuza and Rabkin some 20 years ago [29] . OncovexGM-CSF is armed with GM-CSF , which activates APCs , boosts the immune response to the tumor , and enables a distant effect [23] . A key modulator of the cancer immune response is IL-12 . This cytokine targets a variety of immune cells , activates effector cells , induces IFN\u03b3 secretion which boosts and sustains the immune response [30\u201332] . In humans , the systemic administration of IL-12 was marred by toxicity . The expression of IL-12 from OVs , in particular oHSVs , raised the hopes to benefit from local administration , without the toll of systemic toxicity . The IL-12-armed \u0394\u03b3134 . 5 oHSVs showed efficacy in preclinical models [19 , 29 , 33\u201337] , and one of them is in clinical trial against glioblastoma multiforme [38] . An alternative approach to safety-through-attenuation centres on specific tropism for the cancer cells , achieved by retargeting the virus tropism to cancer-specific receptors of choice , and detargeting from the natural receptors [39\u201341] . The retargeted oHSVs carry no deletion/attenuation . In their target cancer cells they are fully virulent . Because they infect no other cell than the specifically-targeted cancer cells , they promise to be highly safe . When injected intraperitoneally , they caused no harm to tumor-free mice up to the maximum tested dosage ( 108 PFU ) [42] . The tumor cell receptor selected in our laboratory was HER2 ( human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ) [43\u201348] overexpressed in a number of cancers [49] . The HER2-retargeted oHSVs named R-LM249 and R-LM113 exerted a strong therapeutic efficacy in immunodeficient mice [42 , 50\u201352] . A single virus administration practically ablated tumor growth [42] . When administered intraperitoneally ( i . p . ) in a model of peritoneal carcinomatosis they rendered 60% of mice tumor-free [51] . The immunodeficient mouse model underscores the therapeutic effect against primary tumors , accounts for the oncolytic effect of the virus , but is inadequate to evaluate the immunotherapeutic effects . The central question that prompted this study was to what extent a fully virulent HER2-retargeted oHSV , armed with IL-12 , exemplified here by R-115 , was able to elicit a local immune response , lymphocytes migration to the tumor and activation , and ultimately local and distant immunotherapeutic efficacy . The question stemmed from intrinsic differences between retargeted oHSVs and the deleted/mutated oHSVs in clinical use . A major difference relates to the innate response , a phenomenon that also impacts on adaptive immunity . As mentioned , most oHSVs are defective in the synthesis of the \u03b3134 . 5 product , a protein that contrasts the host innate response to the virus [26] . Hence , these viruses are defective in counteracting the innate response . In contrast , fully virulent non-attenuated HSVs first elicit an innate response ( e . g . secretion of IFN type I , TNF , etc . ) , but then dampen it through a number of molecular mechanisms ( e . g . secretion of IL-10 , IL-6 ) that limit the hostile microenvironment and ultimately favour viral replication [53\u201357] . It was thus unclear to what extent the regulation of the innate response put in place by a virulent oHSV would affect its ability to modify the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment , and to elicit a strong adaptive durable response . Additional differences include the efficient replication and the lack of off-target infection . Specifically , the retargeted oHSVs replicate to near wt-virus yields in human target cancer cells [48] , and fail to infect cells other than the targeted cancer cells [44] . In contrast , the currently employed oHSVs infect various cell types in the tumor bed . We report that R-LM113 , and its IL-12 encoding derivative R-115 inhibited the growth of the primary treated tumor , completely prevented the growth of distant untreated tumors , elicited local and systemic immune response and thus induced a vaccine-like response . In all assays the IL-12-armed R-115 was more effective than the unarmed R-LM113 . \n A major difficulty encountered when switching from immunodeficient to immunocompetent mice is that murine cells are scarcely permissive to HSV infections , and the viral replication may be 2\u20133 , or more , logs lower in murine cancer cells than in human cancer cells [58 , 59] . This is an obvious obstacle in the preclinical studies , and strongly underestimates the efficacy of oHSVs . Further limitations in our experimental model were that HER2-retargeted oHSV only infected HER2-expressing cells , and that the appropriate host for these cells are HER2-transgenic/tolerant mice . Here , we made use of the C57BL/6 HER2-transgenic/tolerant mice , although the parental strain is among the least sensitive to HSV . The murine B16 melanoma cells and the Lewis lung carcinoma ( LLC1 ) cells were made HER2-transgenic by lentiviral transduction , selection with puromycin and single cell cloning . The HER2-LLC1 cells expressed HER2 at higher level than the HER2-B16 cells ( Fig 1 , compare A to C ) and at similar level as the SK-OV-3 cells ( Fig 1E ) , a HER2-expressing human ovary cancer cell line . The HER2-LLC1 and HER2-B16 cells were homogeneous clones ( Fig 1B and 1D ) . SK-OV-3 are shown for comparison ( Fig 1F ) . In both the HER2-LLC1 and HER2-B16 cells , the HER2 expression was stable for more than 30 consecutive passages . HER2-LLC1 and HER2-B16 cells were compared for ability to support the replication of R-LM113 and R-115 [44 , 60] . The latter is a R-LM113 derivative , which expresses the murine interleukin 12 ( mIL-12 ) ( see Fig 1G for a schematic representation of R-LM113 and R-115 genomes ) , in the amount of 200\u2013400 pg/105 SK-OV-3 cells [60] . Fig 1H reports the plating efficiency of both viruses and shows that , on average , the amounts of viruses required to infect a single SK-OV-3 , HER2-LLC1 and HER2-B16 cell were 1 , 20 , and 2500 PFUs , respectively . Based on these figures , we next carried out a virus growth experiment in the three cell lines . The cells were infected at 0 . 1 PFU/cell , according to the virus titre determined in the respective cell line . Under these conditions , R-LM113 and R-115 grew in HER2-LLC1 cells at higher yields than in HER2-B16 cells , and at one order of magnitude lower yields than in the susceptible human SK-OV-3 cells ( Fig 1I ) . As mentioned in the preceding paragraph , the selected mice were the C57BL/6 HER2-transgenic/tolerant mice [61] . To provide formal evidence of HER2 tolerance , we evaluated the engraftment efficiency of HER2-LLC1 or wt LLC1 cells in the HER2-transgenic/tolerant and in the wt C57BL/6 mice . Fig 2A and 2B shows that the HER2-LLC1 cells exhibited a reduced tumor growth and an about 50% reduction in the engraftment ability in wt mice relative to HER2-transgenic/tolerant mice , quantified as reduced tumor growth at d 25 ( Fig 2E ) , and in the Kaplan-Meier survival curves ( Fig 2F ) . In contrast , when the wt-LLC1 cells were implanted in the two types of mice , there was no substantial difference ( Fig 2C\u20132F ) . Thus , the wt mice , but not the HER2-transgenic/tolerant mice , exhibited a resistance to the HER2-LLC1; the resistance was not put in place against the wt-LLC1 cells . We conclude that the HER2-transgenic mice were indeed tolerant to HER2 . The family of HER2-retargeted oHSVs exhibits a high safety profile in nude mice , by virtue of the tropism detargeting from the natural receptors , and retargeting to HER2 [42] . We asked whether the high safety profile was maintained in the immunocompetent ( wt-C57BL/6 ) mice , and in the HER2-transgenic/tolerant counterparts . We injected wt-HSV-1 ( F ) , R-LM113 and R-115 i . p . in wt- and HER2 transgenic/tolerant mice . Since there was no difference between the HER2-transgenic/tolerant and the wt-mice , the results for the two types of mice are presented cumulatively . HSV-1 ( F ) killed 5/6 , and 2/6 mice injected with 2x109 or 1x108 , respectively ( Fig 2G ) . Thus , the LD50 was about at least 2 orders of magnitude higher than expected . A LD50 higher than 1x106 PFU was reported for wt HSV-1 in wt-C57BL/6 upon i . p . administration [62] . Of note , none of the mice injected with R-LM113 or R-115 died , irrespective of whether they were wt or HER2 transgenic/tolerant . The results extend to immunocompetent mice the high safety profile of the HER2-retargeted oHSVs [42] . Furthermore , we evaluated R-115 biodistribution to blood and a number of organs , upon 4 consecutive intratumoral injections at 3\u20134 days distance . Fig 2H shows that no viral genome was detected in any of the organs . The HER2-LLC1 cells were implanted in the right flanks of HER2-transgenic/tolerant C57BL/6 mice . Mice received 4 locoregional injections of R-LM113 or R-115 , at three-four days distance , starting at d 3 after tumor implantation ( early treatment ) ( see schedule in Fig 3A ) . The tumor growth was delayed or halted in some of the mice receiving R-LM113 relative to vehicle-treated mice ( compare Fig 3C to 3B ) . 7/20 mice were tumor-free ( Fig 3C ) . In the R-115-treated mice the tumor growth regressed in 8 animals , or its engraftment was inhibited , resulting in 15/22 tumor-free animals ( Fig 3D ) . Comparison of the tumor volume at d 21 after virus treatment showed a statistically significant reduction in R-LM113-treated mice , and a higher reduction in R-115-treated mice ( Fig 3E ) . The difference between the two treatment arms was statistically significant , and highlighted the IL-12 contribution . The Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed highly significant differences among the three treatment groups ( Fig 3F ) . At d 18 or 30 , a subset of the virus-treated mice ( R-LM113 , n = 4; R-115 , n = 8 ) were implanted with a 1\u00b0 contralateral challenge tumor in the opposite flank; the tumor volumes at d 20 and d 27 after its implantation is reported in Fig 3G . The key finding was that all the mice which survived the primary tumor were protected from the challenge tumor ( Fig 3G ) , irrespective of whether they were treated with R-LM113 or R-115 . We conclude that the early viral treatment induced a reduction in tumor growth . R-115 was clearly and statistically more effective than R-LM113 . All mice which survived the primary tumor were resistant to a 1\u00b0 contralateral challenge tumor . Some of the mice which had survived the primary tumor and had received the 1\u00b0 challenge were included in the long survivor group . The relatively high amounts of viruses administered at each dose were not surprising in view of the results in Fig 1H and 1I , which indicate that it takes almost 20 PFUs ( as titrated in SK-OV-3 ) to infect a single HER2-LLC1 cell , and that both viruses replicated in HER2-LLC1 at 1\u20132 log lower yields than in the human SK-OV-3 cells . Mice implanted with HER2-LLC1 tumor cells received 4 consecutive peri- intra-tumoral injections of R-LM113 or R-115 , starting at 10 days after implantation ( Fig 4A ) . The kinetics of tumor growth are shown in Fig 4B\u20134D . The R-115-treated mice exhibited a delay or reduction in tumor growth , and 3/18 were tumor-free . A significant reduction in tumor volume at d 24 is documented in Fig 4E , relative to vehicle-treated and to R-LM113-treated mice ( Fig 4C\u20134E ) . In the latter group 1/12 was tumor-free ( Fig 4C ) . The survival curves show a statistically significant difference between R-115- and R-LM113-treated mice , or control mice ( Fig 4F ) . At d 18 or 30 mice were implanted with a 1\u00b0 contralateral challenge tumor in the opposite flank , which was rejected in 100% of the animals . The volumes of the challenge tumors , and of the tumors in na\u00efve mice is reported in Fig 4G . These experiments show that ( i ) R-115 treatment was more effective than R-LM113 treatment . This confirms and extends the early treatment data , and highlights a role of IL-12 . ( ii ) All the mice which survived the primary tumor developed a durable resistance and were spared from the 1\u00b0 challenge tumor . Some of the mice which had survived the primary tumor and had received the 1\u00b0 challenge were included in the long survivor group analyzed in Fig 5 . As mentioned , above , the moderate efficacy on primary tumor likely reflects the low susceptibility/permissivity of HER2-LLC1 cells to the viruses . The long-term survivor ( LS ) group included mice which survived the primary tumor , and were unaffected by the 1\u00b0 challenge ( see , Figs 3 and 4 ) ( n = 4 and n = 8 in the R-LM113 and in the R-115 arms , respectively ) . At d 80\u201390 after primary tumor implantation , they received the implantation of a 2\u00b0 untreated contralateral HER2-LLC1 tumor ( Fig 5A for a schematic diagram of treatments ) . 3/4 mice in the R-LM113 arm , and 8/8 in the R-115 arm were fully protected , whereas the na\u00efve mice were not ( Fig 5B\u20135D ) . The size of the second contralateral tumor at d 15 and 28 after implantation shows no or reduced tumor growth in mice of both arms , with highest difference in the R-115-treated mice ( Fig 5E ) . The splenocytes from the long-term survivors which survived the 2\u00b0 challenge were incubated with the HER2-LLC1 tumor cells to detect tumor-specific reactivity; 5 samples ( 63% ) in the R-115 arm , and all 3 samples in the R-LM113 survivors\u2019 group exhibited a significant IFN\u03b3 response ( Fig 5F ) , and a tendency towards higher reactivity in the R-115-treated mice . In the three long-term survivors which did not show a significant response at sacrifice , but resisted tumor engraftment , the sacrifice may have taken place too long after the second challenge , or our assays were not sufficiently sensitive . At sacrifice , the sera of the long-term survivors that resisted the 2\u00b0 challenge exhibited a statistically significant reactivity to HER2-LLC1 and to wt-LLC1 cells in both treatment groups , and higher reactivity in the R-115-treated mice ( Fig 5G ) . No reactivity was observed towards the unrelated murine tumor B16 cells , highlighting the specificity of the response ( Fig 5G ) . The results underscore a systemic tumor-specific cell-mediated and humoral immune response in the long-term survivors , argue that the protection from distant tumor growth was immune-mediated , and suggest that the viral treatments broke the tolerance to HER2 as well as to the tumor neoantigens . Next , we evaluated whether mice developed a long-term antibody response to HSV-1 . The long survivor sera were reacted with HSV-1-infected or uninfected rabbit skin cells . As a positive control , we included a monoclonal antibody to HSV-1 glycoprotein D , named HD1 [63] . The mice treated peri- intra-tumorally with R-115 or R-LM113 developed antibodies to the virus ( Fig 5H ) . To shed light on the immune basis of the acquired resistance and to identify the immune effectors associated with the therapeutic effects exerted by R-LM113 and R-115 , we evaluated the modifications elicited by the viruses in tumor infiltrating cells and in immune markers . A new group of mice was treated as depicted in Fig 4A , i . e . with 4 consecutive virus administrations , starting at d 10 after tumor implantation . Tumors were explanted 6\u20137 days after completion of the virus treatment . Based on the virus effect on tumor growth , we subdivided the animals in responders and non-responders . The first exhibited a regression or slowdown in tumor growth . The latter exhibited a tumor growth similar to that in the untreated arm . The tumor growth curves are shown in Fig 6A\u20136E . A most striking result was the difference in the responder/non-responder ratio between the two arms , namely 3/12 and 18/13 in the R-LM113 and R-115 arms . This corresponds to 20% and 58% responders/treated animals in the two arms . The tumor volumes in the five groups at d 22 is reported in Fig 6F . HSV genome copies in the tumors ranged from 300 to 775000 copies/100ng DNA , did not differ between the two treatment arms , nor between responders and non-responders , and was in overall agreement with previous observations [36] . In the blood and in a number of tissues , there was practically no detectable virus genome , as shown in Fig 2H . Thus , virus presence was strictly limited to the tumor . The presence of non-responder mice may reflect both the stochastic nature of the immune response and individual variations in the repertoire of immune cells , and the fact that the amounts of administered viruses were insufficient to elicit a total response , as seen in the efficacy data . Next , we characterized the immune cells present in tumors and spleens . Although the number of responder mice in the R-LM113 arm was very small , and data should therefore be interpreted cautiously , two patterns emerged . Thus , CD4+ and CD335+ cells\u2014both total and expressing the CD69 activation marker\u2014were increased in the tumors of all responder mice ( Fig 6H\u20136J ) . CD8+ , both total and expressing the CD69 activation marker , Foxp3+ , and CD141+ cells were increased and CD11b+ cells were decreased preferentially in the responder R-115-treated tumors ( Fig 6K\u20136O ) . The distribution of these cells in the spleens mirrored that in the tumors ( Fig 6Q\u20136X ) . PD-L1 was increased in tumor from R-115-treated mice , and in the spleens of mice treated with either virus ( Fig 6P and 6Y ) . In as much as PD-L1 expression is regulated downstream of the IFN R signaling , its increase in the responder group was likely induced at least in part by IFN\u03b3 . The results suggest that some changes to tumor infiltrating and spleen infiltrating lymphocytes/monocytes were likely elicited by either virus , and , conversely , that the CD8+ cell infiltration was preferentially induced by the IL-12 encoding R-115 . Next , we analyzed the tumors from Fig 6 by reverse transcription quantitative PCR ( qRT-PCR ) . The specimens from both the R-LM113- and R-115-treated mice exhibited a highly significant difference in Ifng and Tbet mRNA levels , relative to the vehicle-treated mice ( Fig 7A and 7B ) . Tbet is a transcription factor which contributes to drive a type 1 T helper ( Th1 ) response and controls IFN\u03b3 expression . There was a clear tendency towards higher response in the R-115 arm , even though a statistical significance analysis was not carried out , given that a single sample was present in the responder R-LM113 group . The results provide a second line of evidence for activation of the intratumoral immune response elicited by the retargeted oHSVs , with a trend for higher activation in the R-115 responder mice . An unbiased analysis of the immune markers at the protein level was carried out by Luminex Multiplex , in tumor specimens taken at 6\u20137 days after virus treatment . Even in this assay , the number of available specimens for the responder R-LM113-treated mice was too low; therefore the R-LM113-derived specimens were considered as a single group . In specimens from both virus treatments there was a clear increase in IFN\u03b3 and Granzyme B , especially in the R-115 responders ( Fig 7C and 7D ) . There was an increase also in TNF\u03b1 and IL-2 in the R-115 specimens ( Fig 7E and 7F ) , highlighting a polarization towards a Th1 response and an activation of the effector cells . IL-10 and IL-6 were specifically increased in the R-115 specimens ( Fig 7G and 7H ) . The IL-12 was detectable at d 5 and increased at d 7 after completion of R-115 treatment ( Fig 7I ) . In R-LM113-treated mice no increase in IL-12 was observed at d 5 relative to vehicle-treated mice . The data extend the evidence for a de-repression of the immunosuppressive microenvironment induced especially by R-115 . We note that TNF\u03b1 , IL-6 and IL-10 are induced also by HSV , so their presence may in part be consequent to infection [54 , 55 , 57] . \n We report on the first efficacy studies of fully virulent , HER2-retargeted oHSVs , either unarmed ( R-LM113 ) or armed with mIL-12 ( R-115 ) . Their peri- intra-tumoral administration led to a reduction in the growth of the primary tumor , particularly in the R-115-treated mice , to intratumoral and systemic immune responses which almost completely prevented the engraftment of distant untreated tumors . In essence , the intralesional vaccination promoted local and systemic immunity . Pertinent to the model system and the main results is the following . Inasmuch R-LM113 and R-115 were retargeted to HER2 , the murine cancer cells were made HER2-transgenic , and the mice were the HER2-transgenic/tolerant C57BL/6 [61] . The safety profile of both viruses was very high , as mice resisted i . p . doses as high as to 2x109 PFU , which were lethal for 83% of the mice injected with wt-HSV . Furthermore , upon peri- intra-tumoral delivery , there was no detectable R-115 infection in organs other than the injected tumors . The selected tumor cells were the HER2-LLC1 , which are markedly less sensitive/permissive than the human cancer cells . This animal system is therefore adequate to investigate the immunotherapeutic efficacy of the HER2-retargeted oHSVs , but is hardly predictive of the therapeutic effects on primary tumors . The high resistance of murine tumor cells to HSV is shared with a large part of preclinical studies on the therapeutic effects of oHSVs [58 , 59] , and clearly results in underestimation of the oncolytic and immunotherapeutic effects of oHSVs . The key efficacy and immunotherapeutic data were as follows . The IL-12 armed R-115 reduced and delayed tumor growth more efficiently than the unarmed R-LM113 . Practically all the mice which survived the primary tumor\u2014from either the R-LM113 or R-115 arm\u2014were protected from a distant challenge tumor , and , after several weeks , from a subsequent re-challenge . Hence , the highest effect was the abscopal one . A specific systemic immune response was detected at sacrifice both in splenocytes and in sera of the long-term survivors . The durable vaccine effect adds to the strong oncolytic effects exerted on the primary human tumors in immunodeficient mice [42 , 50 , 51] . The immune basis of the therapy was documented by two lines of evidence , i . e . the early modifications to the immune suppressive tumor microenvironment and the establishment of a systemic response . With respect to the early modifications , the tumors in responder mice contained significant amounts of immunostimulatory factors , at higher frequencies/amounts in the R-115 arm . Beside IL-12 , these included IFN\u03b3 , IL-2 , Granzyme B , Tbet and TNF\u03b1 , \u2014typical effectors of IL-12 , Th1 polarization and natural killer ( NK ) cell activation , in addition to IL-10 and IL-6 . The tumor microenvironment of the responder mice was further characterized by infiltration and activation of immune cells . Although the number of R-LM113 responders was very low and data should be considered cautiously , two patterns emerged . CD4+ and CD335+ NK cells appeared to be induced by either virus . These cells may well represent the first line of anti-tumor defence put in place by virulent oHSVs . CD8+ and CD141+ cells , PD-L1+ tumor cells , and Foxp3 T regulatory cells were preferentially induced by R-115 , along with a decrease in the number of intratumoral CD11b+ cells . The role of each immune cell subpopulation of in virus-induced antitumor activity is the subject of intense studies . The impact of the CD8+ cell infiltration in unleashing the immunosuppressive phenotype of the tumor and in sensitizing otherwise refractory cancers to checkpoint inhibitors was documented recently also in clinical specimens from patients treated with OncovexGM-CSF + pembrolizumab [18 , 64] . More controversial appears to be the role of NK cells . These cells and their effectors IFN\u03b3 , TNF\u03b1 , Granzyme B were selectively increased in the R-115-treated tumors . The impact of the NK cell recruitment in the Maraba virus-induced eradication of cancer was well established [34] . In contrast , in glioblastoma viro-immunotherapy induced by a transcriptionally retargeted oHSV the activation and recruitment of NK cells to the treated tumor diminished the anti-tumor efficacy [65] . Specific NK cell depletion experiments will shed light on the role played by NK cells on the antitumor activity of the HER2-retargeted o-HSVs . The increase in Foxp3+ T-regulatory lymphocytes was observed upon treatment with other OVs , e . g . Newcastle disease virus , and may reflect an autoregulatory mechanism put in place upon CD8+ cell-mediated response [66] . Also the monocytic lineage was affected by the viral treatment; in particular CD11b+ cells were decreased in R-115 responders . These cells include cells that contribute to the immunosuppressive properties of the tumor microenvironment , including myeloid-derived-suppressor cells [67] . Not surprisingly they were present in higher amounts in the tumors of non responder mice , and may contribute to resistance . Of the cytokines induced by R-115 , TNF\u03b1 , IL-6 and IL-10 are part also of the signature of the antiviral innate response to HSV , finalized to limit the virus-hostile microenvironment and to favour virus replication [53\u201355 , 57] . Hence , the immune-related molecules in the tumor microenvironment are likely to be induced in part by the virus itself , in part by the virus-encoded IL-12 . The former are not necessarily detrimental to the control of tumor growth . It has been proposed that the OV-induced antiviral immune responses may exert intrinsic anticancer benefits and may be critical for establishing clinically desired antitumor immunity [68 , 69] . Studies with a recombinant o-poliovirus suggested activation of dendritic cells and immune adjuvancy as a result of canonical innate anti-pathogen response [70] . The systemic response was detected in splenocytes and as durable antibody response towards both the HER2-LLC1 and the wt-LLC1 cells . This finding implied that the virus treatment broke the tolerance not only to the HER2-LLC1 but also to the wt-LLC1 cells , and argued that , especially for R-115 , a systemic route of delivery was not required to achieve a systemic vaccine protection . The high efficacy against the engraftment of distant untreated tumors , implanted long after virus treatment , and the Th1 polarization bare strong similarities with the therapeutic effect of a IL-12-armed oncolytic measles virus [33] . In that case , the viral backbone was that of a measles virus vaccine strain . Differences are readily evident between current efficacy data and those exerted by attenuated \u0394\u03b3134 . 5 oHSVs . The major effect of OncovexGM-CSF on B16 melanoma cancer cells in C57BL/6 mice was exerted on the primary treated tumor . The effects on the distant untreated tumors were limited [58] and a long-term protection was only achieved when the OncovexGM-CSF was combined with anti-CTLA-4 [58] . The different effects seen in that study and in current investigation likely reflect the different action of the cytokines expressed by the respective oHSV , i . e . the GM-GSF in OncovexGM-CSF and the IL-12 in R-115 , the permissivity of the respective murine cancer cells to HSV infection , as well as the genomic properties of the viral backbones , namely a deleted/attenuated viral genome in OncovexGM-CSF , and a full non-attenuated genome in R-115 . The importance of the genomic backbone is clearly apparent when the effects elicited by R-115 are compared to those elicited by the IL-12-armed G47 [19] . The two recombinants express the same cytokine , and differ strikingly in their genome . The IL-12-G47 carries multiple deletions , whereas R-115 carries no deletion . As a monotherapy against a model glioblastoma tumor , G47 alone or the IL-12-G47 were barely effective [19] . A strong efficacy required the combination of IL-12-G47 with both CPIs , the anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 Abs . While the glioblastoma model likely exemplifies a refractory and immunosuppressive tumor , and , possibly , a resistant tumor to HSV infection , the current finding that the IL-12-armed R-115 reduced the growth of the primary tumor and fully protected the mice from the growth of distal tumors in the absence of combination with CPIs argue that the fully virulent retargeted oHSVs have the potential to be highly active oncolytic-immunotherapeutic agents . \n Human ovary SK-OV-3 cancer cells ( Roswell Park Memorial Institute ) were cultured in RPMI- Glutamax ( Life Technologies #61870\u2013010 ) containing 10% fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) . LLC1 and B16 cells were purchased from ATCC and cultured in Dulbecco modified Eagle medium ( Life Technologies , #31966\u2013021 ) containing Glutamax , High Glucose and 10% FBS . R-LM113 was described [44] . R-115 is a derivative of R-LM113; like the parental R-LM113 , it is retargeted to HER2 . It expresses the murine IL-12 ( mIL-12 ) under the CMV promoter [60] . Viruses were cultivated and titrated by plaque assay in SK-OV-3 cells . The mIL-12 production was quantified in the supernatant of R-115-infected cells by means of mIL-12 ELISA kit ( EMIL12 , Thermo Fisher Scientific ) according to manufacturer instruction . The HER2 receptor expressed in murine cancer cells was a chimera in which the C-tail signaling portion was replaced with the C-tail of the non-signaling nectin1 receptor . The construct was named as HER2-nectin , and herein referred to as HER2 . For the engineering , the ectodomain of human HER2 receptor was amplified from pcDNA-HER2 plasmid [71] with primers HER2_NheI_f GCGGCCGCGCTAGCATGGAGCTGGCGGCCTTGTGCCGC and HER2_HpaI_r AGAGATGATGGAGTTAACAGGGCTGGCTCTCTGCTCGGCGGG . The HER2 ectodomain amplicon spans from ATG start codon up to the amino acid 650 ( GenBank NM_004448 ) . pCF18HNK was described [72] . The plasmid was cut with NheI-HF and HpaI ( New England Laboratories ) to delete the ectodomain of human nectin1 from amino acid 1 to 330 ( GenBank NM_203285 . 1 aa 1\u2013330 ) . The HER2 ectodomain amplicon was cut with NheI and HpaI and then ligated into NheI/HpaI digested pCF18HNK to generate pHER2-Nectin plasmid . The entire HER2-Nectin chimeric ORF was sequenced . Then , a NheI/XbaI fragment from pHER2-nectin plasmid was subcloned in the NheI/XbaI digested lentiviral expression vector pLV-EF1-MCS-SV40-Puro . The resulting expression vector was called pLV-HER2-nectin-puro . The B16 melanoma and the LLC1 cells were made transgenic for HER2-nectin expression by lentiviral transduction , as detailed [73] . Transduced cells were selected by means of puromycin , enriched for HER2 expressing cells with microbeads ( Miltenyi Biotech ) following incubation with an anti-HER2 mouse IgG antibody ( SantaCruz Biotecnology , clone 9G6 ) . Single-cell clones were obtained by limiting dilution . Clones were checked for stable HER2 expression for up to 30 passages in cell culture by flow cytometry ( BD Accuri ) with anti-HER2 MGR2 antibody ( Vinci-Biochem , #ALX-804-573-C100 ) . To measure the virus growth , HER2-LLC1 , HER2-B16 and SK-OV-3 cells were infected at an input multiplicity of 0 . 1 PFU/cell ( as titrated in the respective cell line ) for 90 min at 37\u00b0C . Unabsorbed virus was inactivated by means of acidic wash ( 40 mM citric acid , 10 mM KCl , 135 mM NaCl , pH 3 ) . Replicate cultures were frozen at the indicated times ( 24 and 48 h ) after infection and the progeny was titrated in SK-OV-3 . To determine the relative plating efficiency , replicate aliquots of R-115 or R-LM113 were plated onto HER2-LLC1 , HER2-B16 and SK-OV-3 cells . The infected monolayers were overlaid with medium containing agar . The plaques were scored 3 days later . The results represent the average of triplicates \u00b1 SD . C57BL/6 mice transgenic for and tolerant to HER2 ( B6 . Cg-Pds5bTg ( Wap-ERBB2 ) 229Wzw/J ) [61] were obtained from Wayne State University through The Jackson Laboratories , and bred in the facility of the Department of Veterinary Medical Sciences , University of Bologna . The animals for tumor implantation were HER2-transgenic ( HER2-TG ) . HER2-LLC1 cells were implanted subcutaneously in the left flank of six-to-eight weeks old HER2-TG C57BL/6 mice in 250 \u03bcL of PBS , 0 . 2x106 cells/mouse . The start of the virus treatment is detailed in the Results section . Mice received 4 loco-regional or peri- intra-tumoral ( p . i . t . ) injections of the respective virus suspension , diluted in PBS , 1x108 PFU/mouse , at 3\u20134 days distance . Mice in the control group received PBS ( vehicle ) . Each treatment group consisted of 5 , 10 or more mice , as detailed in the Figure legend . Tumor volumes were scored twice weekly by measuring the largest and the smallest diameter by means of a calliper . Tumor volume was calculated using the formula: largest diameter x ( smallest diameter ) 2 x 0 . 5 . Mice were killed when tumor volumes exceed 1000\u20132000 mm3 , ulceration occurred , or animals exhibited distress or pain . Where indicated , mice received a contralateral tumor , made of HER2-LLC1 cells implanted subcutaneously in the right flank , 0 . 2x106 cells/mouse . The contralateral tumors were not treated . Freshly explanted spleens were smashed through a 70 \u03bcm cell strainer in PBS with a sterile 5ml syringe plunger to isolate splenocytes . Red blood cells in spleen and tumor samples were lysed with ACK buffer ( NH4Cl 150 mM , NaHCO3 10 mM , 1mM EDTA ) , resuspended in medium ( RPMI 1640 containing 10% heat inactivated FBS , 1% penicillin/streptomycin , 0 . 05 mM \u03b2-Mercaptoethanol ) , counted and seeded in 24 well plate . Splenocytes ( 1x106 cell/well ) were incubated with 1x105 HER2-LLC1 cells in 0 . 5 ml medium , and cocultured for 48 h . Media were collected and the amount of secreted IFN\u03b3 was quantified by ELISA ( IFN-gamma Mouse ELISA Kit , Thermo Fisher ) . Tumors were minced , resuspended in lysis buffer ( Tris-HCl pH 7 . 4 50 mM , NaCl 250 mM , EDTA 5 mM , Na3VO4 1 mM , NaF 50 mM , NaN3 0 . 02% , Sodium deoxycholate 0 . 5% , NP40 1% , N\u03b1-p-tosyl-L-lysin chloromethyl ketone hydrochloride 0 . 3 mM , N\u03b1-p-tosyl-L-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone 0 . 3 mM , PMFS 1 mM ) , in a proportion of 500\u03bcL of lysis buffer for 100 mg of tumor . Samples were sonicated with Bioruptor ( Diagenode ) , using program HIGH for 20 minutes ( 30sec ON 30sec OFF ) and centrifuged for 30 minutes at 11000 x g . The protein content of supernatants was determined by means of the Bio-Rad protein assay ( Bio-Rad ) ; the supernatants were analyzed by means of a Magnetic Luminex Assay ( R&D ) and a mouse premixed Multi-Analyte kit . The custom-made kit included: TNF\u03b1 ( BR14 ) , IL-12 p70 ( BR15 ) , IL-2 ( BR22 ) , IL-4 ( BR25 ) , IL-6 ( BR27 ) , IL-10 ( BR28 ) , IL-17A ( BR30 ) , IFN\u03b3 ( BR33 ) , CXCL10/IP-10 ( BR37 ) , Granzyme B ( BR63 ) . Supernatants were 1:1 or 1:5 diluted with the Calibrator Diluent RD6-52 and analyzed according to manufacturer instructions . Standard curve with 1:1 diluted lysis buffer was employed to quantify TNF\u03b1 , IL-2 , IL-4 , IL-6 , IL-10 , IL-17A , IP-10 and Granzyme B in 1:1 diluted samples , while the quantification of IFN\u03b3 was performed in 1:5 diluted samples , using the corresponding standard curve in 1:5 diluted lysis buffer . Data were analyzed according to the manufacturer instructions . Results were expressed as pg of each analyte per mg of total proteins . Quantification of IL-12 p70 was under the LOD for Luminex analysis , hence the analyte was quantified by means of the Mouse IL-12 ELISA kit . Tumors were homogenized .

Our recent study reported that human Ad5-specific CD4 T cells induced by Ad5 vaccination ( RV156A trial ) are susceptible to HIV . Here we further investigated the HIV susceptibility of vector-specific CD4 T cells induced by ALVAC , a canarypox viral vector tested in the Thai trial RV144 , as compared to Ad5 vector-specific CD4 T cells in the HVTN204 trial . We showed that while Ad5 vector-specific CD4 T cells were readily susceptible to HIV , ALVAC-specific CD4 T cells in RV144 PBMC were substantially less susceptible to both R5 and X4 HIV in vitro . The lower HIV susceptibility of ALVAC-specific CD4 T cells was associated with the reduced surface expression of HIV entry co-receptors CCR5 and CXCR4 on these cells . Phenotypic analyses identified that ALVAC-specific CD4 T cells displayed a strong Th1 phenotype , producing higher levels of IFN-\u03b3 and CCL4 ( MIP-1\u03b2 ) but little IL-17 . Of interest , ALVAC and Ad5 vectors induced distinct profiles of vector-specific CD8 vs . CD4 T-cell proliferative responses in PBMC , with ALVAC preferentially inducing CD8 T-cell proliferation , while Ad5 vector induced CD4 T-cell proliferation . Depletion of ALVAC- , but not Ad5- , induced CD8 T cells in PBMC led to a modest increase in HIV infection of vector-specific CD4 T cells , suggesting a role of ALVAC-specific CD8 T cells in protecting ALVAC-specific CD4 T cells from HIV . Taken together , our data provide strong evidence for distinct HIV susceptibility of CD4 T cells induced by different vaccine vectors and highlight the importance of better evaluating anti-vector responses in HIV vaccination . \n Over 30 years after the discovery of HIV as the causative agent of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) , HIV/AIDS continues to be a significant challenge for global public health . More than 36 million people are currently living with HIV , with over 2 million new infections and 1 million AIDS-related deaths per year [1] . Development of a safe and effective HIV vaccine remains a high research priority . Recombinant viral vectors are an important platform for HIV vaccine development . To date , a number of HIV vaccine vectors derived from different viral families have been developed , including adenovirus [2] and poxvirus [3 , 4] . Several clinical trials ( Step and Phambili ) testing candidate HIV vaccines based on human Ad5 vector ( rAd5 ) have failed due to lack of efficacy and/or transiently increased HIV infections in some vaccinated individuals [5\u20137] . These unanticipated results from clinical trials have brought to light the importance of understanding host immune responses induced against viral vectors in HIV vaccination [8 , 9] . CD4 T cells are central to host immunity by providing help signals to other components of the immune system [10] . The protective role of CD4 T cell responses has been documented for various pathogenic infections , including HIV [11\u201314] . However , CD4 T cells are also major target cells for HIV infection . During an antigen-specific immune response , activation and expansion of responding CD4 T cells is required [15] , which is usually desired in most vaccine strategies but could become a potential problem in HIV vaccination due to the fact that HIV preferentially infects activated CD4 T cells [16\u201319] . Recent research from our group and others has shown that human CD4 T cells specific for different antigens differ in their susceptibility to HIV infection [20\u201326] . In particular , we have reported that human Ad5-specific CD4 T cells generated in response to both natural Ad5 infection and rAd5 vaccination are highly susceptible to HIV and are preferentially depleted in HIV-infected individuals [21] . Although potential mechanisms for Ad5 vector-associated excess HIV infections in the Step and Phambili studies are thought to be complex and could be affected by different factors such as the quantity , quality and in vivo localization of CD4 T cells induced during vaccination , our findings suggest that understanding the HIV susceptibility of vector-specific CD4 T-cell populations induced by different vaccine vectors may provide new insights into our understanding of host immunity in HIV vaccination . In addition to rAd5 , another important HIV vaccine vector that has been tested in late-stage clinical trials is ALVAC , a recombinant canarypox virus vector . The ALVAC prime/gp120 boost HIV vaccine regimen tested in the \u201cThai\u201d RV144 trial demonstrated modest efficacy ( ~31% ) [27] . Building upon the partial success of RV144 , multiple ongoing trials further evaluating ALVAC-based HIV vaccine regimens are currently being conducted [28 , 29] . In this study , we sought to understand anti-vector T cell responses with a focus on the phenotype and in vitro HIV susceptibility of vector-specific CD4 T cells induced by vaccination with ALVAC compared to Ad5 . Cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) from RV144 vaccine recipients were analyzed in comparison with PBMC from HVTN204 , a phase II trial evaluating rAd5-HIV vaccine ( DNA prime/Ad5 boost ) [30] , using the in vitro HIV susceptibility assay reported in our previous studies [20 , 21 , 23] . We also measured vector-induced CD8 T-cell response in these PBMC samples . Our data show that vector-specific CD4 T cells induced by different HIV vaccine vectors manifest marked difference in their susceptibility to HIV infection; compared to Ad5-specific CD4 T cells in HVTN204 PBMC , the ALVAC-specific CD4 T cells in RV144 PBMC are substantially less susceptible to both R5 and X4 HIV infection in vitro . The differential HIV susceptibility between these two groups of vector-specific CD4 T cells is closely associated with their differences in phenotype , cytokine expression , and interestingly , the profiles of vector-specific CD8 vs . CD4 T-cell proliferative response induced by these two vectors . \n To compare the HIV susceptibility of different HIV vaccine vector-induced CD4 T cells ( ALVAC vs . Ad5 ) in human vaccine recipients , we employed the in vitro HIV infection assay reported in our previous studies [20 , 21 , 23] ( Summarized in S1 Fig ) . In brief , PBMC samples of vaccine recipients in RV144 ( ALVAC ) and HVTN204 ( Ad5 vector ) were first stained with CFSE , a fluorescent dye used to track T-cell proliferation , and then stimulated with the corresponding empty vector for three days to induce the expansion of vector-reactive CD4 T cells , followed by infection with either CCR5-tropic ( R5; US-1 strain ) or CXCR4-tropic ( X4; 92/UG/029 strain ) HIV . Three days post-infection ( dpi ) , flow cytometry was used to measure T-cell proliferation ( indicated by decreased CFSE fluorescence intensity; CFSE-low ) and HIV infectivity in vector-specific CD4 T cells ( intracellular HIV p24+ rate in CFSE-low CD4 T cells ) ( S1A Fig ) . We have previously verified this in vitro system by demonstrating that the CFSE-low , proliferating CD4 T cells are mostly antigen specific ( S1B Fig ) and closely resemble their in vivo phenotypes ( S1C Fig ) . Based on this system , we first observed that both ALVAC and Ad5 vector induced significant levels of CD4 T-cell proliferation in PBMC of vaccine recipients ( ALVAC for RV144 and Ad5 for HVTN204 ) ( Fig 1 ) . Regarding HIV susceptibility , we found that compared to Ad5 vector-induced CD4 T cells in HVTN204 PBMC , which were highly susceptible to R5 HIV infection ( mean p24+%: 26 . 9% ) , the ALVAC-induced CD4 T cells in RV144 PBMC were markedly less susceptible to R5 HIV ( mean p24+%: 1 . 27% ) ( p<0 . 01 ) ( day 3 post-infection ) ( Fig 1A ) . We also monitored HIV infection in vector-induced CD4 T cells for up to 9 days post exposure and found that ALVAC-induced CD4 T cells remained resistant to HIV on day 9 post viral exposure ( p24+: 0 . 5% ) , whereas Ad5 vector-specific CD4 T cells were still readily susceptible ( p24+: 11 . 8% ) ( S2 Fig ) . Consistent with the results of R5 HIV infection , a similar lower susceptibility to X4 HIV ( 92/UG/029 strain ) was also observed for ALVAC-induced CD4 T cells ( mean p24+%: 1 . 82% ) as compared to Ad5 vector-induced CD4 T cells ( mean p24+%: 16 . 2% ) ( p<0 . 01 ) ( Fig 1B ) . As controls , we showed that the two vectors induced very little T-cell proliferation in pre-vaccine PBMC of the same individuals ( S3A Fig ) , suggesting that the T-cell proliferation observed in post-vaccine PBMC in our system were specific to vector with minimal non-specific proliferation . In addition , very little intracellular p24 ( <0 . 1% ) was detected in the same proliferating CD4 T cells when HIV was not added , supporting that intracellular p24 staining in our system is specific ( S3B Fig ) . As another control , RV144 and HVTN204 PBMC were polyclonally activated by anti-CD3/CD28 . We showed that anti-CD3/CD28-activated CD4 T cells in RV144 and HVTN204 PBMC were susceptible to HIV infection at comparable level ( S4 Fig ) . Furthermore , we noted that in Ad5-stimulated PBMC , the CFSE-hi CD4 T cells appeared to be more sensitive to HIV as well compared to those in ALVAC-stimulated PBMC ( Fig 1A ) . This might be related to the lower secretion of \u03b2-chemokines in the Ad5-stimulated PBMC culture , which will be presented later . Transmitted founder virus ( TFV ) is important in HIV transmission . In addition to R5 US-1 and X4 92/UG/029 strains used , we also tested the susceptibility of vector-induced CD4 T cells to AD17 HIV molecular clone , a TFV [31 , 32] . Consistently , we observed that ALVAC-induced CD4 T cells were also less susceptible to AD17 TFV infection ( p24+ %: 0 . 6% ) as compared to Ad5 vector-induced CD4 T cells ( p24+ %: 3 . 8% ) ( S5 Fig ) , although the overall infectivity of AD17 TFV in these CD4 T cells was lower than that of the US-1 and 92/UG/029 strains ( S5 Fig ) . In vector HIV vaccination , insert-specific CD4 T cells are also induced in addition to vector-specific CD4 T cells . Therefore , we measured HIV susceptibility of vaccine Env-specific CD4 T cells using the same assay and found that unlike vector-specific CD4 T cells , Env-specific CD4 T cells in both RV144 and HVTN204 PBMC were readily susceptible to R5 and X4 HIV infection with no significant difference detected ( S6 Fig ) . Taken together , these data suggest that the vector-specific CD4 T cells induced by different HIV vaccine vectors manifest marked differences in their susceptibility to both R5 and X4 HIV infection in vitro , with ALVAC-specific CD4 T cells being less susceptible than Ad5 vector-specific CD4 T cells . We and others have shown that differential HIV susceptibility of human antigen-specific CD4 T cells can occur at both HIV entry and post-entry levels [20 , 33] . An important factor that influences HIV infection of target cells at the entry level is the surface expression of the HIV co-receptors CCR5 and CXCR4 . To understand potential mechanisms underlying the differential HIV susceptibility of ALVAC and Ad5 vector-specific CD4 T cells described above , we examined CCR5 and CXCR4 expression on these two groups of vector-specific CD4 T cells . We found that ALVAC-specific CD4 T cells expressed significantly lower frequencies of CCR5+ CD4 T cells ( CCR5+%: 8 . 4 \u00b1 1 . 8 ) than Ad5 vector-specific CD4 T cells ( CCR5+%: 31 . 9 \u00b1 5 . 1 ) ( p<0 . 005 ) ( Fig 2A ) . A similar difference was also observed for CXCR4 expression on ALVAC- and Ad5 vector-specific CD4 T cells ( CXCR4+ % for ALVAC vs . Ad5: 8 . 3 \u00b1 1 . 6 vs . 38 . 6 \u00b1 7 . 4 ) ( p<0 . 001 ) ( Fig 2B ) . These data suggest that limited expression of CCR5 and CXCR4 represents an important mechanism for the lower susceptibility of ALVAC-specific CD4 T cells to R5 and X4 HIV , respectively , compared to Ad5 vector-specific CD4 T cells . To better understand the relative contribution of co-receptor expression to the overall HIV susceptibility of vector-induced CD4 T cells in our system , we further analyzed HIV infection in co-receptor+ and co-receptor- ( CCR5+/- and CXCR4+/- ) subsets of Ad5-specific CD4 T cells as compared to that in ALVAC-specific CD4 T cells . Not surprisingly , we found that majority of HIV infection was observed in CCR5+ or CXCR4+ subsets of Ad5-specific CD4 T cells ( Fig 2C ) . We also noted that the HIV infection rate in the CCR5- subset ( p24+: 23% ) or CXCR4- subset ( p24+: 5 . 3% ) of Ad5-specific CD4 T cells ( Fig 2C ) remained higher than the overall HIV infection rate in ALVAC-specific CD4 T cells ( Fig 1 ) . This data suggests that other factors may also contribute to the differential HIV susceptibility between Ad5- and ALVAC-specific CD4 T cells besides co-receptor expression . At the post-entry level of viral infection , HIV infectivity is associated with innate antiviral status and the activation state of target cells . Our recent study has demonstrated that ALVAC and Ad5 vector manifest distinct innate stimulatory properties with ALVAC being able to activate strong innate responses in antigen-presenting cells ( APCs ) [34] . This could potentially affect the antiviral status of CD4 T cells in vector-stimulated PBMC . We therefore compared the antiviral status of vector-specific CD4 T cells in our system . CFSE-low CD4 T cells were sorted from vector-stimulated PBMC and subjected to gene-expression analysis for antiviral genes and common HIV restriction factors , including A3G , MxB , SAMHD1 , Tetherin and TRIM5 . We found that expression of the genes was comparable between Ad5- and ALVAC-specific CD4 T cells ( Fig 3A ) . Consistent with this result , blockade of type-I IFN signaling in ALVAC-stimulated PBMC [34] did not significantly alter the HIV infection in ALVAC-specific CD4 T cells ( Fig 3B ) . These data suggest that the differential HIV susceptibility of vector-specific CD4 T cells may not be related to their innate antiviral status . Next , we assessed immune activation status of vector-specific CD4 T cells by examining the expression of T-cell activation markers ( CD25 and CD69 ) . While no significant difference CD69 expression was observed between ALVAC- and Ad5-specific CD4 T cells , Ad5-specific CD4 T cells appeared to express slightly higher level of CD25 than ALVAC-specific cells ( Ad5 vs . ALVAC: 81% vs . 65% ) ( Fig 3C ) . This activation status of vector-specific CD4 T cells is generally consistent with their susceptibility to HIV infection . Human antigen-specific CD4 T cell populations manifest different phenotypes in memory differentiation , T helper ( Th ) lineages , and cytokine profiles which are associated with their susceptibility to HIV infection [20\u201323 , 25 , 35 , 36] . We next characterized major phenotypes of ALVAC- and Ad5 vector-specific CD4 T cells . Based on expression of CCR7 and CD45RO , human CD4 T cells can be categorized into central memory ( CM: CCR7+CD45RO+ ) and effector memory subsets ( EM: CCR7-CD45RO+ ) . By focusing on the CFSE-low CD4 T cells , we found that both ALVAC- and Ad5 vector-specific CD4 T cells predominantly manifested an EM-like phenotype 2 weeks after the final vaccination , and no significant difference in memory phenotypes was observed between ALVAC- and Ad5 vector-specific CD4 T cells ( Fig 4A ) . Mucosal homing is another important characteristic of CD4 T cells that influences HIV pathogenesis . Mucosal compartments represent a major site for HIV infection and CD4 depletion in HIV disease [37] . Integrin \u03b14\u03b27 is an important mucosal homing receptor , directing migration of CD4 T cells to gut mucosa [38] . We found that compared to Ad5 vector-specific CD4 T cells , which expressed high levels of \u03b14\u03b27 as reported in previous studies [16 , 21] , ALVAC-specific CD4 T cells expressed significantly lower levels of \u03b14\u03b27 ( Fig 4B ) . Next , we examined T-helper lineage and cytokine profile of ALVAC- and Ad5 vector -specific CD4 T cells . As described , CFSE-stained PBMC from vaccine recipients were stimulated with ALVAC or Ad5 vector to induce vector-specific CD4 T cell expansion . Since cytokine expression in activated T cells is usually transient and the CFSE-low , vector-specific CD4 T cells in our system undergo days of proliferation , in order to measure cytokine production in CFSE-low CD4 T cells the culture was re-stimulated with the global PMA/ionomycin stimulus on day 6 for cytokine de novo re-synthesis in T cells as we reported previously [21 , 23] . Since Th17 CD4 T-cell subset has been shown to be highly susceptible to HIV as compared to Th1 subset [21 , 23] , we first measured expression of IFN-\u03b3 , IL-17 and IL-2 in vector-specific CD4 T cells ( Fig 4C ) , and found that a significantly higher fraction of ALVAC-specific CD4 T cells expressed IFN-\u03b3 than Ad5 vector-specific CD4 T cells ( 64 . 6% \u00b1 6 . 98 vs . 43 . 0% \u00b1 5 . 96; p<0 . 05 ) , typical of a strong Th1-like response . In contrast , a higher fraction of Ad5-specific CD4 T cells expressed IL-2 ( 39 . 0% \u00b1 4 . 68 vs . 17 . 6% \u00b1 4 . 90; p<0 . 01 ) and IL-17 ( 8 . 71% \u00b1 1 . 55 vs . 3 . 50% \u00b1 0 . 77; p<0 . 01 ) , suggesting a mixed Th1/Th17 response ( Fig 4C and 4D ) . This result is in agreement with our previous report that examined Ad5 vector-specific CD4 T cells in PBMC from the RV156A trial [21] . Therefore , since IL-17- and IL-2-producing CD4 T cells are known to be more susceptible to HIV infection than IFN-\u03b3-producing CD4 T cells , this differential Th1 vs . Th1/Th17 phenotype for ALVAC- and Ad5-specific CD4 T cells is consistent with their susceptibility to HIV infection . Besides Th1 and Th17 markers , we also examined other major T-cell associated phenotypes for vector-specific CD4 T cells , including T-follicular helper ( Tfh ) , regulatory T cells ( Treg ) and PD-1 ( T-cell exhaustion marker ) . First , we observed that a significant fraction of both ALVAC- and Ad5-specific CD4 T cells expressed IL-21 , a lineage-specific cytokine for Tfh cells . However , unlike IFN-\u03b3 and IL-17 , no significant difference in IL-21 expression was found between ALVAC- and Ad5-specific cells ( S7A Fig ) . Further analysis identified that HIV infection in IL-21+ Tfh-like subset ( p24+: 7 . 6% ) was not higher than IL-21- subset ( p24+: 10 . 3% ) ( S7B Fig ) , suggesting that in our system HIV does not preferentially infect Tfh-like CD4 subset [39] . Furthermore , we measured expression of Treg markers ( CD25 and FoxP3 ) and exhaustion marker PD-1 in vector-specific CD4 T cells and found that , similar to Tfh , no significant difference in expression of Treg markers ( S7C Fig ) and PD-1 ( S7D Fig ) was observed between ALVAC- and Ad5-specific CD4 T cells . Altogether , these data suggest that Tfh , Treg and PD-1 phenotypes may not account for the differential HIV susceptibility of ALVAC- and Ad5-specific CD4 T cells in our system . \u03b2-chemokines ( MIP-1\u03b1 , MIP-1\u03b2 , and RANTES ) are CCR5 ligands and can block CCR5-tropic ( R5 ) HIV infection at entry level by competitively binding to CCR5 [33 , 40 , 41] . Therefore , we examined MIP-1\u03b2 ( CCL4 ) expression in the CFSE-low , vector-specific CD4 T cells . Not surprisingly , we found that a significantly higher fraction of ALVAC-specific CD4 T cells expressed MIP-1\u03b2 than Ad5 vector-specific CD4 T cells ( 57 . 10% \u00b1 5 . 67 vs . 36 . 84% \u00b1 4 . 16; p<0 . 01 ) ( Fig 5A ) . To evaluate the potential impact of \u03b2-chemokine production on HIV susceptibility of vector-specific CD4 T cells in our system , in vitro HIV infection ( CCR5-tropic; US-1 ) was conducted in the presence of neutralizing antibodies against these \u03b2-chemokines ( CCL3/MIP-1\u03b1 , CCL4/MIP-1\u03b2 , and CCL5/RANTES ) . We found that blocking \u03b2-chemokines could modestly , but significantly , increase the susceptibility of ALVAC-specific CD4 T cells to R5 HIV ( p <0 . 01 ) ( Fig 5B ) , suggesting a role for \u03b2-chemokines in protecting ALVAC-specific CD4 T cells from R5 HIV . However , we also found that even in the presence of \u03b2-chemokine neutralization , ALVAC-specific CD4 T cells were still significantly less susceptible to R5 HIV than Ad5 vector-specific CD4 T cells ( Fig 5B; Fig 1A ) , suggesting that the higher production of \u03b2-chemokines contributes only partly to the lower susceptibility of ALVAC-specific CD4 T cells to HIV as compared to Ad5 vector-specific CD4 T cells in our system . By simultaneous analyses of both CD8 and CD4 T cells , we found that ALVAC and Ad5 vector elicited distinct profiles of vector-specific CD8 vs . CD4 T-cell proliferative response in PBMC . ALVAC stimulated robust vector-specific CD8 , but relatively weak vector-specific CD4 , T-cell proliferation in RV144 PBMC , whereas Ad5 vector predominantly induced vector-specific CD4 , but not CD8 , T-cell proliferation in HVTN204 PBMC ( Fig 6A ) . When we analyzed the cumulative results from multiple vaccine recipients ( n = 14 ) , although no significant difference in the magnitudes of vector-specific CD4 T-cell proliferation was observed between ALVAC and Ad5 ( 13 . 43 \u00b1 3 . 118 vs 19 . 62 \u00b1 4 . 633 , respectively; p = 0 . 2776 ) , ALVAC induced significantly higher levels of vector-specific CD8 T-cell proliferation in RV144 PBMC ( 31 . 94 \u00b1 5 . 085 vs 8 . 908 \u00b1 2 . 172; p = 0 . 0004 ) than Ad5 vector did in HVTN204 PBMC ( Fig 6B ) . We further analyzed the ratio of vector-induced CD8 vs . CD4 T-cell proliferation within the same individuals and compared between ALVAC and Ad5 ( Fig 6C ) , and found that ALVAC induced a much higher ratio of CD8/CD4 T-cell proliferation than Ad5 vector did ( 3 . 137 \u00b1 0 . 5696 vs 0 . 5615 \u00b1 0 . 1364; p = 0 . 0003 ) ( Fig 6C ) . In contrast , the vaccine insert antigen envelope ( Env ) induced strong CD4 and weak CD8 T-cell proliferation in RV144 PBMC , but comparable levels of CD4 and CD8 T-cell proliferation in HVTN204 PBMC ( S8 Fig ) , consistent with the results of Env-specific CD4/CD8 T-cell response measured by ex vivo ICS in previous studies [27 , 30] . Taken together , these data suggest that ALVAC induces a distinct profile of vector-specific CD8 to CD4 T-cell proliferative response from that induced by Ad5 vector in vitro . The importance of CD8 T cells in anti-HIV immunity , including control of viral replication and limiting HIV-infected CD4 T cells , has been well established [42\u201344] . In our system , we have observed low levels of CD4 T-cell proliferation in RV144 PBMC after ALVAC stimulation as compared to that in HVTN204 PBMC after Ad5 vector stimulation , which could possibly reflect the inhibition of CD4 T cell proliferation by ALVAC-induced CD8 T cells . Therefore , we next explored the potential impact of vector-induced CD8 T cells on vector-specific CD4 T cell proliferation . CD8 T cells were depleted from PBMC using magnetic cell sorting ( MACS ) prior to CFSE staining and vector re-stimulation . Efficient depletion of CD8 T cells from PBMC was confirmed ( Fig 7A ) . Subsequently , proliferation of CD4 and CD8 T cells in the whole or CD8-depleted PBMC was measured on day 6 by flow cytometry . We showed that depletion of CD8 T cells from ALVAC-stimulated PBMC led to a significant increase in the proliferation of ALVAC-specific CD4 T cells in RV144 PBMC ( p = 0 . 0068 ) , whereas no such effect was seen in CD8-depleted HVTN204 PBMC when stimulated by Ad5 vector ( p = 0 . 1747 ) ( Fig 7B ) . These results suggest that , unlike Ad5 vector-induced CD8 T cells , ALVAC-induced CD8 T cells can inhibit the expansion of autologous vector-specific CD4 T cells in PBMC . To explore potential mechanisms by which ALVAC-stimulated CD8 T cells inhibit autologous ALVAC-specific CD4 T-cell proliferation , we conducted trans-well experiments where CD8 T cells were first depleted from PBMC and then added back to the culture in trans-well . We found that addition of CD8 T cells in trans-well could largely , though not completely , restore the inhibitory effect of CD8 T cells on ALVAC-specific CD4 T-cell proliferation ( from 26 . 3% to 16 . 9% , compared to 13 . 3% for whole PBMC ) ( Fig 7C ) , suggesting that CD8 T cells inhibit ALVAC-specific CD4 proliferation via a cell-contact-independent mechanism . CD25+FoxP3+ regulatory CD8 T cells are an emerging CD8 subset with strong suppressive activities [45] . We measured CD25 and FoxP3 expression in vector-activated CD8 T cells on day 6 after initial vector stimulation and found that a much higher fraction of ALVAC-activated CD8 T cells were CD25+FoxP3+ ( 22 . 4% ) as compared to Ad5-activated CD8 T cells ( 7 . 52% ) ( Fig 7D ) , suggesting that ALVAC-induced CD25+FoxP3+ CD8 T cells could play a role in inhibition of autologous vector-specific CD4 T-cell proliferation . In addition to CD4 T cell inhibition , we also explored potential cytolytic effects of CD8 T cells from RV144 vaccine recipients on autologous CD4 T cells in response to ALVAC stimulation . Three conditions of RV144 PBMC were prepared as described above , including whole PBMC , CD8-depleted PBMC , and CD8 T cell addition back to trans-well culture ( Fig 7E ) . On day 3 after ALVAC stimulation , before significant cell proliferation occurred in the culture ( S9 Fig ) , the viability of total cells ( CD3+ T cells and CD3- non-T cells ) was measured by flow cytometry based on aqua blue staining ( Fig 7E ) . We observed that compared to the whole PBMC that had only 15 . 1% live T cells , CD8-depleted PBMC had higher levels of live T cells ( 26 . 5% ) ( Fig 7E and 7F ) . Addition of the depleted CD8 T cells back to the trans-well culture decreased the level of live T cells ( 18 . 8% ) ( Fig 7E and 7F ) . The percent of live CD4 T cells ( after subtracting CD8 T cells from the total live CD3+ T cells ) in each condition was summarized and shown in Fig 7F . This data suggests that in ALVAC-stimulated PBMC , CD8 T cells can manifest a cytotoxic effect on the autologous CD4 T cells , which involves a cell-contact-independent mechanism . This cytotoxic effect of CD8 T cells may also contribute to the overall inhibition of ALVAC-specific CD4 T-cell expansion in our system . In the context of vector HIV vaccination , it has been speculated that vector-induced CD4 T cells can be potential targets for HIV , which may affect the risk of HIV acquisition in vaccine recipients and overall outcome of vaccination [8] . Therefore , limiting the numbers and/or HIV susceptibility of vector-induced CD4 T cells in HIV vaccination is thought to be critical . We next explored the impact of vector-induced CD8 T cells on HIV susceptibility of autologous vector-specific CD4 T cells in PBMC , by using the above CD8-depletion assay . Whole or CD8-depleted PBMC were CFSE-labeled , and stimulated with vector antigen for 3 days , followed by infection with R5 or X4 HIV . Three days after infection , HIV infectivity in vector-specific CD4 T cells was measured by flow cytometry based on intracellular HIV p24 expression in CFSE-low CD4 T cells . We found that compared to whole PBMC , depletion of CD8 T cells from ALVAC-stimulated PBMC led to considerable increase in both R5 and X4 HIV infection of ALVAC-specific CD4 T cells ( R5 HIV for CD8+ and CD8-: 2% vs . 6%; X4 HIV for CD8+ and CD8-: 7 . 4% vs . 13 . 8% ) ( Fig 8A ) . Analyses of PBMC from multiple subjects showed strong statistical significance between whole and CD8-depleted PBMC ( p = 0 . 0006 ) ( Fig 8B ) ; in contrast , depletion of CD8 T cells in Ad5 vector-stimulated PBMC ( HVTN204 ) had no significant impact on HIV infection rate of Ad5 vector-specific CD4 T cells ( Fig 8A and 8B ) . Of interest , it should be noted that even in the absence of CD8 T cells ( CD8 depletion ) , ALVAC-specific CD4 T cells were still significantly less susceptible to HIV infection than Ad5 vector-specific CD4 T cells ( 5 . 63 \u00b1 1 . 84 vs 28 . 56 \u00b1 5 . 16; p = 0 . 0002 ) ( Fig 8B ) , suggesting that CD8 T cells contributed only partly to the low HIV susceptibility of ALVAC-specific CD4 T cells as compared to Ad5 vector-specific CD4 T cells . These data indicate that unlike Ad5 vector , ALVAC may induce vector-specific CD8 T cells that can not only inhibit the expansion of autologous vector-specific CD4 T cells , but also limit their susceptibility to HIV infection . CD8 T cells can control viral infections through various mechanisms , including cytolytic activity and the secretion of soluble HIV-suppressive factors [46] . We next characterized potential mechanisms underlying CD8-mediated HIV inhibition in autologous ALVAC-specific CD4 T cells . First , we observed that CD8 depletion did not significantly affect the expression of CCR5 and T-cell activation markers ( CD25 and CD69 ) on ALVAC-specific CD4 T cells ( S10 Fig ) . We then performed a similar CD8 trans-well experiment to explore if the HIV inhibition by CD8 T cells is dependent of cell contact or soluble factors . We found that CD8 T cells could still inhibit R5 HIV infection in ALVAC-specific CD4 T cells even in the absence of direct cell contact ( p24% for CD8- vs . trans-well CD8+: 11 . 1% vs . 5 . 1% ) ( Fig 8C ) , indicating that soluble HIV suppressive factors may play a role in this process . Consistent with this observation , we found that compared to Ad5 vector , ALVAC-induced CD8 T cells produced markedly higher levels of MIP-1\u03b2 ( MIP-1\u03b2+ % in Ad5 vs . ALVAC-induced CD8 T cells: 27 . 5% vs . 85 . 2% ) ( Fig 8D ) . Since in ALVAC-stimulated PBMC , high levels of CD8 T cells were induced ( Fig 6 ) , and \u03b2-chemokines were shown to mediate R5 HIV inhibition in ALVAC-specific CD4 T cells in our system ( Fig 5 ) , secretion of more \u03b2-chemokines might represent a mechanism for HIV inhibition in ALVAC-specific CD4 T cells by CD8 T cells . Lastly , we observed that compared to CD8-depleted PBMC , the presence of CD8 T cells in PBMC led to higher level of cell death ( based on aqua blue staining ) in CFSE-low , ALVAC-specific CD4 T cells ( aqua blue staining in CD8+ vs . CD8-: 16 . 5% vs . 5 . 82% ) ( Fig 8E ) . This data suggests that the cytotoxic effects of CD8 T cells may also contribute to overall HIV inhibition in ALVAC-specific CD4 T cells . Lastly , we characterized the poly-functional profile of ALVAC- and Ad5 vector-induced CD8 T cells by examining expression of antiviral and cytolytic effectors . CFSE-stained PBMC from RV144 or HVTN204 were re-stimulated with ALVAC or Ad5 vector , respectively , as described above . Six days after stimulation , cells were briefly treated with PMA and ionomycin for 6 hours to induce de novo re-synthesis of cytokines or effector molecules . Expression of IFN-\u03b3 , MIP-1\u03b2 , CD107a , granzyme B ( GZMB ) , and perforin in CFSE-low , vector-induced CD8 T cells was measured by flow cytometry . We found that compared to Ad5 vector , significantly higher percentages of ALVAC-induced CD8 T cells expressed IFN-\u03b3 ( 78 . 74 \u00b1 12 . 50 vs 36 . 86 \u00b1 7 . 57; p = 0 . 0210 ) , MIP-1\u03b2 ( 88 . 38 \u00b1 4 . 753 vs 33 . 00 \u00b1 4 . 51; p < 0 . 0001 ) and perforin ( 75 . 86 \u00b1 9 . 139 vs 27 . 91 \u00b1 8 . 369; p = 0 . 0047 ) ( Fig 9 ) . No significant difference in expression of GZMB ( ALVAC vs . Ad5: 31 . 60 \u00b1 9 . 720 vs 19 . 94 \u00b1 5 . 913; p = 0 . 4261 ) and CD107a ( ALVAC vs . Ad5: 15 . 32 \u00b1 6 . 853 vs 6 . 893 \u00b1 1 . 199; p = 0 . 2713 ) was observed between ALVAC- and Ad5-induced CD8 T cells ( Fig 9 ) . Altogether , these data suggest that ALVAC-induced CD8 T cells manifest a stronger antiviral and cytolytic phenotype than Ad5 vector-induced CD8 T cells . \n In the present study , by using PBMC samples from two important HIV vaccine trials , we investigated host anti-vector T-cell responses induced by ALVAC and Ad5 vector in human vaccine recipients with a focus on the HIV susceptibility of vector-specific CD4 T cells . Our major finding is that different HIV vaccine vector-induced CD4 T cells manifest distinct susceptibility to HIV infection; while Ad5 vector-specific CD4 T cells are readily susceptible to HIV [21] , ALVAC-specific CD4 T cells in RV144 PBMC are more resistant to both R5 and X4 HIV infection . Associated with this are the differences in phenotypes and cytokine profiles of these two groups of vector-specific CD4 T cells . Another major finding of our study is that in contrast to the lack of vaccine insert-specific CD8 T-cell response reported from the RV144 trial [27 , 47] , we demonstrate that ALVAC vector induces strong proliferative response of vector-specific CD8 T cells , which can limit the proliferation and HIV susceptibility of the autologous ALVAC-specific CD4 T cells . The unexpected outcomes of human trials testing HIV vaccine regimens involving different viral vectors have suggested that assessment of both protective and potentially detrimental immune responses induced by vaccination is important [8 , 48] . Development of a safe and efficacious HIV vaccine poses a unique challenge in that HIV infects the very CD4 T cells which are usually required to mount an effective adaptive response; this is of especial concern for viral vector vaccines because the expansion of vector-specific CD4 T cells following immunization can provide potential HIV target cells [8 , 21] , while presumably not contributing to anti-HIV immunity . From this point of view , it would be advantageous to employ vectors which generate fewer and/or less HIV-susceptible vector-specific CD4 T cells . Human CD4 T cells specific for different antigens or pathogens manifest differential susceptibility to HIV [20\u201326] . Our previous study has reported that human Ad5-specific CD4 T cells induced by natural infection or rAd5 vaccination are more susceptible to HIV infection [21] . This finding suggests that although Ad5 vectors have been commonly employed for vaccine development due to their potent immunogenicity [49] , the advantages of Ad5 as a vector may be dampened by the high HIV susceptibility of CD4 T cells it induces . Our current study shows that unlike Ad5 vector , the vector-specific CD4 T cells induced by ALVAC in RV144 are markedly less susceptible to HIV infection ( Fig 1 ) . This finding is relevant to HIV vaccine development , considering that in the context of HIV vaccination , if vaccine-induced protective immunity is comparable between different vaccine regimens , the relative HIV susceptibility of vector-specific CD4 T cells may be an important factor that can affect the overall outcome of HIV vaccination . Future studies are being planned to examine the HIV susceptibility of CD4 T cells induced by other important HIV vaccine vectors , especially the adenovirus rare serotypes Ad26 and Ad35 . Parameters that influence HIV acquisition risk in HIV vaccination are thought to be complex , among which the level , quality ( e . g . phenotypes , cytokine profile , and HIV susceptibility ) and in vivo localization of induced CD4 T cells play important roles . Our data suggest that the high HIV susceptibility of Ad5 vector-specific CD4 T cells may be a contributing factor for the observed excess HIV infections in some Ad5-HIV vaccine recipients [5\u20137] . In addition , our ongoing studies examining in vivo localization and phenotypes of CD4 T cells following ALVAC and Ad5 immunization show that ALVAC immunization induces substantial lower levels of CCR5+CD4+ and CCR5+ \u03b14\u03b27+CD4+ T cells in various immune compartments , especially in the gut mucosa , of the immunized mice as compared to Ad5 immunization . Based on these findings , we propose that to better understand immune parameters associated with HIV acquisition risk in vector HIV vaccination , future studies are warranted to more thoroughly assess the frequency , quality and in vivo localization of vaccine-induced CD4 T cells in animal models and/or human trials . HIV infection of antigen-specific CD4 T cells can be regulated at both entry and post-entry levels , and is closely associated with the phenotypic and functional characteristics of these CD4 T cells [20 , 25 , 33 , 35] . CCR5 and CXCR4 as HIV entry co-receptors play major roles in regulating the susceptibility of target cells to HIV at entry level [50] . Our data show that ALVAC-specific CD4 T cells express markedly lower levels of CCR5 and CXCR4 than Ad5 vector-specific CD4 T cells ( Fig 2 ) , providing an explanation for the lower HIV susceptibility of ALVAC-specific CD4 T cells . We further identified that HIV infection rate in CCR5-/CXCR4- subset of Ad5-specific CD4 T cells remained higher than that in ALVAC-specific CD4 T cells ( Fig 2C ) , suggesting that factors other than co-receptor expression are also involved in regulating the differential HIV susceptibility of vector-specific CD4 T cells in our system . Regulation of HIV co-receptor expression on target cells has been investigated previously in HIV pathogenesis [33 , 51] . However , currently little is known about co-receptor regulation in HIV vaccination . Evidence from our ongoing studies suggests that innate signals derived from vector-infected APCs play a role in regulating CCR5 on CD4 T cells . Further understanding mechanisms that regulate HIV co-receptor expression on vaccine-induced cells is an interesting topic and should be pursued in future studies . Another important factor that regulates HIV infection of CD4 T cells at entry level is \u03b2-chemokines , including CCL3 ( MIP-1\u03b1 ) , CCL4 ( MIP-1\u03b2 ) , and CCL5 ( RANTES ) [33 , 40 , 41] . Our data show that compared to Ad5 vector , ALVAC-induced T cells ( CD4 and CD8 ) produce much higher levels of \u03b2-chemokines ( MIP-1\u03b2 ) ( Fig 5A ) ; however , interestingly , neutralization of \u03b2-chemokines in ALVAC-stimulated PBMC only slightly increased HIV infection in ALVAC-specific CD4 T cells ( Fig 5B ) , suggesting a modest role of \u03b2-chemokines in this process . In addition to co-receptors and \u03b2-chemokines , cytokine profiles of CD4 T cells are closely associated with HIV infection . It has been shown that IL-17-producing CD4 T cells are more susceptible to HIV than IFN-\u03b3-producing CD4 T cells [20 , 21 , 23 , 52 , 53] . In our study , we demonstrate that while Ad5 vector-specific CD4 T cells manifest a mixed Th1/Th17 phenotype , producing high levels of IL-17 and IFN-\u03b3 [21] , ALVAC-specific CD4 T cells display a polarized Th1-like phenotype , producing high level of IFN-\u03b3 but very little IL-17 ( Fig 4C and 4D ) . This different cytokine profile of ALVAC- and Ad5-specific CD4 T cells is consistent with their susceptibility to HIV infection in our system . CD8 T cells play important roles in anti-HIV immunity , including control of HIV replication and limiting HIV-infected cells [43 , 44] . An interesting observation in the current study is that ALVAC and Ad5 vector stimulate distinct CD8 vs . CD4 T-cell proliferative responses; Ad5 vector stimulate predominantly CD4 T-cell proliferation , whereas ALVAC stimulate strong CD8 T-cell proliferation ( Fig 6 ) . This finding is somewhat unexpected since the ALVAC/gp120 vaccine regimen in the RV144 trial was reported to elicit a weak insert-specific CD8 response [27] , whereas Ad5-HIV vaccines have been shown to induce a strong insert-specific CD8 response [5 , 6 , 30] . These findings suggest that the induction of anti-vector and anti-insert T-cell responses in vector HIV vaccination may be differentially regulated . In this study , mechanisms for differential stimulation of vector-specific CD8 vs . CD4 T-cell proliferation by ALVAC and Ad5 remain unknown . However , a prominent difference between ALVAC and Ad5 vector is related to their intracellular locations for replication . After entry into target APCs , poxvirus replicates in cytoplasm [54] , whereas adenovirus replicates in nucleus [55] . This may lead to engagement of different antigen presentation pathways ( e . g . MHC class I vs . II ) and therefore differential induction of CD8 vs . CD4 T-cell responses to these two vectors . Nevertheless , elicitation of vector-specific CD8 vs . CD4 responses by different vaccine vectors in vivo and the immune pathways involved remain less clear and should be further investigated . Another interesting finding of this study is that unlike Ad5 vector , ALVAC-activated CD8 T cells can inhibit the proliferation and HIV infection of autologous vector-specific CD4 T cells ( Fig 7 and Fig 8 ) . Evidence presented in our study supports that the process may involve both lytic and non-lytic effects of CD8 T cells [46] . First , our trans-well experiments showed that CD8 T cells could still inhibit ALVAC-specific CD4 T cell proliferation ( Fig 7C ) and HIV susceptibility ( Fig 8C ) even in the absence of cell contact , indicating that soluble factors play a role in mediating the inhibitory effects of CD8 T cells . Indeed , we demonstrate that compared to Ad5 vector , ALVAC-activated CD8 T cells manifest a stronger Treg potential ( CD25+FoxP3+ ) ( Fig 7D ) and produce higher levels of \u03b2-chemokines ( Fig 8D ) , which may respectively inhibit ALVAC-specific CD4 T-cell proliferation and HIV susceptibility . Other than the non-lytic mechanisms , our data suggest that the cytotoxic effects of CD8 T cells may also play a role . We found that the presence of CD8 T cells in either whole PBMC or in trans-well culture ( depleted CD8 T cells were added back ) caused significant cytotoxic effect on total CD4 T cells ( Fig 7E and 7F ) as well as on ALVAC-specific CD4 T cells ( Fig 8E ) . In support , we further demonstrate that compared to Ad5 vector , ALVAC-activated CD8 T cells manifest a stronger cytolytic and antiviral phenotype , expressing elevated levels of perforin , IFN-\u03b3 , and MIP-1\u03b2 ( Fig 9 ) . Collectively , our observation that preferential induction of strong vector-specific CD8 , but not CD4 , T-cell proliferation by ALVAC as compared to Ad5 vector provides some new insights into our understanding of vaccine-induced immunity in HIV vaccination . In summary , we here present strong evidence that CD4 T cells activated via different HIV vaccine vectors manifest distinct susceptibility to HIV infection , which is closely associated with their phenotypic and functional characteristics . Our findings suggest that future efforts should focus on candidate vaccine vectors that can maximize immunogenicity while minimizing potential HIV susceptibility , for example , by inducing low levels of vector-specific CD4 T cells with high HIV resistance . Future studies will seek to extend this analysis to other important HIV vaccine vectors and to further explicate the mechanism underlying differential HIV susceptibility of vector-specific CD4 T cells . Research that aims to understand how vector-specific CD8 T cells may exert anti-HIV activity and the immune pathways by which ALVAC stimulates strong vector-specific CD8 T-cell proliferation should also be of interest . \n The study involves use of PBMC samples from two HIV vaccine clinical trials: RV144 ( NCT00223080 ) ( ALVAC-HIV prime/gp120 protein boost ) and HVTN204 ( NCT00125970 ) ( DNA prime/rAd5 boost ) . De-identified , cryopreserved PBMC collected from vaccine responders of these two trials were used . All samples were analyzed anonymously and investigators of this study have no access to any subject identification information . The study was determined as non-human subject research and approved by the University of Texas Medical Branch\u2019s IRB . Written informed consents were obtained from study participants . PBMC were maintained at 37\u00b0C , 5% CO2 in RPMI medium ( Invitrogen ) supplemented with 10% human serum , 100 U/mL penicillin G , 100 U/mL streptomycin sulfate , and 1 . 17mM sodium glutamine . R5 ( US1 ) and X4 ( 92/UG/029 ) HIV-1 ( original stock from NIH ) was used for in vitro infection of PBMC . HIV transmitted founder virus ( TFV ) strains ( including AD17 clone ) were a kind gift from Dr . Jason Kimata of Baylor College of Medicine . Empty ALVAC vector was obtained from Sanofi , and empty rAd5 vector was obtained from the Vaccine Research Center ( VRC ) of NIH . PBMC were CFSE labeled as described previously with slight modifications [20 , 21 , 23] . Thawed and washed PBMC at a concentration of 20 x 106 PBMC/mL were stained in 1\u03bcM CFSE for 8 minutes at 25\u00b0C . Cells were then quenched with 2 mL of warm normal human serum for 5 minutes . Empty ALVAC or rAd5 vector corresponding to the original vaccine was used to re-stimulate CFSE-labeled PBMC ( MOI of 3 ) . Unstimulated PBMC were included as a control . Three days after stimulation , cells were exposed to pre-titrated R5 HIV , X4 HIV , or TFV HIV for in vitro infection . Three days after HIV exposure , HIV infection in CD4 T cells was analyzed by flow cytometry based on intracellular HIV p24 expression . For viral kinetics experiments , HIV infection rate was measured at 3 and 9 days post infection . In some experiments , anti-MIP-1\u03b1 ( 5\u03bcg/mL; clone 93321; R&D Systems ) , anti-MIP-1\u03b2 ( 5\u03bcg/mL; clone 24006; R&D Systems ) , and anti-RANTES ( 5 \u03bcg/mL; clone 21418; R&D Systems ) were added to the cultures throughout the experiments to neutralize \u03b2-chemokines . In some experiments , anti-human IFNAR antibody ( Abcam , final concentration: 5 \u03bcg/ml ) was added to the cultures throughout the experiments to block type-I IFN signaling . In some experiments , CD8+ cells were depleted from PBMC using the EasySep Human CD8 Positive Selection Kit ( Stem Cell Technologies , cat #17833 ) for comparison with whole PBMC . In the trans-well co-culture experiment , CD8 T cells were isolated from PBMC of RV144 vaccine recipients using the EasySep\u2122 Human CD8+ T Cell Isolation Kit ( StemCell Technologies ) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol after CFSE labeling . After CD8 T cell isolation , CD8 depleted PBMC and the corresponding whole PBMC were infected with ALVAC ( MOI = 1 ) , followed by HIV infection as describe above . In addition , isolated CD8 T cells were added back to the trans-well culture to explore mechanisms underlying CD8 T cell-mediated inhibition . Briefly , CD8-depleted PBMC were placed in the bottom chamber of the trans-well co-culture system , and the isolated autologous CD8 T cells were added back to the top chamber . The trans-well culture was also stimulated by ALVAC and infected with HIV as described above . HIV susceptibility and cellular phenotypes for different conditions ( whole PBMC , CD8-depleted PBMC , CD8-depleted PBMC with added CD8 T cells in trans-well ) were similarly measured by multi-color flow cytometry as described . CFSE staining , vector stimulation and in vitro HIV infection of PBMC were conducted as described above . On day 6 after vector stimulation ( 3 days after HIV infection ) , cells were subjected to immune staining and flow cytometric analysis to examine the phenotypes and HIV susceptibility of vector-specific CD4 T cells . Cells were first stained with LIVE/DEAD fixable aqua dead cell stain ( ThermoFisher Scientifc , cat #L34957 ) and antibodies to surface markers including CD3 , CD4 , CD8 , CCR5 , \u03b14\u03b27-APC ( NIH AIDS Reagent Program ) , CCR7 , PD-1 , CD25 and CD45RO . Except \u03b14\u03b27 , all surface antibodies were from BD Bioscience . Cells were then fixed , permeabilized ( BD Biosciences cat #554722 ) , and stained for HIV p24 ( Beckman Coulter ) for measuring HIV susceptibility of vector-specific CD4 T cells in PBMC ( p24+ rate in CFSE-low CD4 T cells ) . In some experiments that also measured the expression of intracellular cytokines in vector-specific CD4 cells , cells were treated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ( PMA ) and ionomycin for 5 hours prior to staining in order to stimulate de novo cytokine production . After fixation and permeabilization , cells were also stained for intracellular cytokines IFN-\u03b3 , IL-2 , IL-17 , IL-21 , ( Biolegend ) , MIP-1\u03b2 ( BD Biosciences ) . In experiments that measured the antiviral and cytolytic profile of vector-specific CD8 T cells , anti-CD107a antibody ( BD Biosciences ) was added during cell stimulation . After fixation and permeabilization , cells were also intracellularly stained for perforin and Granzyme B ( BD Bioscience ) . In experiments that measured regulatory T cells , cells were permeabilized using a FoxP3 Staining Buffer Set ( eBioscience cat #00-5523-00 ) and stained for FoxP3 ( Biolegend ) . Antibody capture compensation beads ( BD Biosciences ) stained with individual antibodies were prepared for compensation . Cell samples and compensation beads were acquired at LSR-II ( BD ) . Flow cytometric data were analyzed using FlowJo Version 10 software ( TreeStar ) . Vaccine trial PBMC were CFSE stained and vector stimulated as described above . After 6 days of proliferation , cells were stained for CD3 , CD4 and viability ( Live/Dead Fixable Violet ) . The CFSE-low , CD3+CD4+ T cells were sorted from PBMC using FACSAria IIU ( BD Biosciences ) . Total RNA was the sorted cells using Quick-RNA MicroPrep Kit ( Zymo ) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol . Gene expression was quantified using iTaq Universal SYBR Green Supermix ( Bio-Rad ) and the CFX Connect Real-Time PCR Detection System ( Bio-Rad ) after reverse transcription from RNA into cDNA using iScript Reverse Transcription Supermix for RT-qPCR ( Bio-Rad ) . Primer sequences for quantification of gene expression are shown in S1 Table . The relative quantity of gene expression was calculated using the 2\u2212\u0394\u0394Ct method . Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 6 ( GraphPad , Inc . ) Two-tailed , unpaired Student\u2019s T tests were performed and a p value \u2264 0 . 05 considered significant . Ratio-paired T tests were performed where appropriate .", "headings": ["Abstract", "Introduction", "Results", "Discussion", "Materials and methods"], "keywords": ["blood cells", "t helper cells", "flow cytometry", "hiv infections", "viral vaccines", "medicine and health sciences", "immune cells", "pathology and laboratory medicine", "pathogens", "immunology", "microbiology", "retroviruses", "viruses", "immunodeficiency viruses", "vaccines", "preventive medicine", "rna viruses", "cytotoxic t cells", "infectious disease control", "vaccination and immunization", "research and analysis methods", "public and occupational health", "infectious diseases", "spectrum analysis techniques", "white blood cells", "animal cells", "medical microbiology", "hiv", "t cells", "microbial pathogens", "hiv vaccines", "spectrophotometry", "cytophotometry", "cell biology", "virology", "viral pathogens", "biology and life sciences", "cellular types", "viral diseases", "lentivirus", "organisms"], "id": "journal.ppat.1006888"}
{"lay_summary": "With the exception of its most primitive members , mammal species practice X inactivation , where one copy of each X chromosome pair is silenced in each cell of the female body . The particular copy of the X that is silenced nevertheless shows considerable variability among species , and the evolutionary causes for this variability remain unclear . Here , we show that X inactivation strategies are likely to evolve in response to the sex-differential fitness properties of X-linked genetic variation . Genetic variation with similar effects on male and female fitness will generally favor the evolution of random X inactivation , potentially including preferential inactivation of the maternally inherited X chromosome . Variation with opposing fitness effects in each sex ( \u201csexually antagonistic\u201d variation , which includes mutations that both decrease female fitness and enhance male fitness ) selects for preferential or complete inactivation of the paternally inherited X . Paternally biased X inactivation patterns appear to be common in nature , which suggests that sexually antagonistic genetic variation might be an important factor underlying the evolution of X inactivation . The theory provides a conceptual framework for understanding the evolution of X inactivation strategies and generates several novel predictions that may soon be tested with modern genome sequencing technologies .", "article": "X inactivation\u2014the transcriptional silencing of one X chromosome copy per female somatic cell\u2014is universal among therian mammals , yet the choice of which X to silence exhibits considerable variation among species . X inactivation strategies can range from strict paternally inherited X inactivation ( PXI ) , which renders females haploid for all maternally inherited alleles , to unbiased random X inactivation ( RXI ) , which equalizes expression of maternally and paternally inherited alleles in each female tissue . However , the underlying evolutionary processes that might account for this observed diversity of X inactivation strategies remain unclear . We present a theoretical population genetic analysis of X inactivation evolution and specifically consider how conditions of dominance , linkage , recombination , and sex-differential selection each influence evolutionary trajectories of X inactivation . The results indicate that a single , critical interaction between allelic dominance and sex-differential selection can select for a broad and continuous range of X inactivation strategies , including unequal rates of inactivation between maternally and paternally inherited X chromosomes . RXI is favored over complete PXI as long as alleles deleterious to female fitness are sufficiently recessive , and the criteria for RXI evolution is considerably more restrictive when fitness variation is sexually antagonistic ( i . e . , alleles deleterious to females are beneficial to males ) relative to variation that is deleterious to both sexes . Evolutionary transitions from PXI to RXI also generally increase mean relative female fitness at the expense of decreased male fitness . These results provide a theoretical framework for predicting and interpreting the evolution of chromosome-wide expression of X-linked genes and lead to several useful predictions that could motivate future studies of allele-specific gene expression variation . \n Mammalian females transcriptionally silence one of their two X chromosomes within each somatic cell \u2013 a process called X inactivation [1] , [2] . The basic phenomenon of X inactivation occurs in all therian ( non egg-laying ) mammals studied to date , yet the specific X chromosome silenced exhibits considerable diversity among species . At one extreme , typical of marsupials , the paternally inherited X is universally silenced and the maternally inherited X is ubiquitously expressed ( [3] , [4]; hereafter referred to as paternal X inactivation or PXI ) . In contrast , placental mammals practice random X inactivation ( RXI ) : each somatic cell may express either the maternally or the paternally inherited X ( the other X is silenced ) , and female bodies are composed of a mosaic of cells that individually express one of the two X chromosome copies [5] . While RXI is generally thought to be unbiased \u2013 with each cell having an equal probability of expressing either of the two X chromosomes \u2013 recent data reveal quantitatively biased inactivation patterns in at least some placental mammal species , i . e . : differential silencing of maternally and paternally derived X chromosomes [6] , [7] . Several marsupial studies similarly find evidence for partial expression of the paternally derived X , suggesting additional species-specificity of X inactivation rules ( reviewed in [2] , [8] ) . The selective processes that might account for this observed diversity remain unclear . A leading hypothesis for the evolution of RXI is that it might be favored if segregating deleterious mutations have recessive or partially recessive fitness effects ( [9]\u2013[11]; which , on average , they do [12]\u2013[15] ) . The logic underlying this hypothesis is straightforward . Females that uniformly silence a particular copy of the X ( e . g . , the paternally inherited copy under PXI ) will be effectively haploid , and suffer the full fitness costs of mutations carried on their expressed X chromosome . RXI generates an expression pattern that is more similar to diploidy , and can potentially mask the fitness costs of carrying deleterious alleles . While the masking hypothesis for the evolutionary origins of RXI is plausible ( e . g . , [1] , [16]\u2013[20] ) , its feasibility should be investigated in a formal population genetic model . Models of a similar evolutionary scenario , the evolution of haploid versus diploid life cycles ( e . g . , [21]\u2013[25] ) , indicate that selection for masking of deleterious mutations favors the evolution of diploidy , if mutations are sufficiently recessive relative to the population's recombination rate ( [26]\u2013[30]; however , selection to mask somatic mutations eliminates constraints imposed by tight linkage [31] ) . However , these models do not incorporate the unique properties of sex-differential selection and inheritance that govern X chromosome evolution [32] , so it remains unclear whether their conclusions apply to the case of RXI . Sex differences in selection \u2013 where the fitness effects of single mutations differ in magnitude or direction between males and females \u2013 likely influence large fractions of animal genomes [33]\u2013[36] , which can have two potential consequences for the evolutionary diversification of X inactivation strategies . Stronger selection against deleterious alleles in males compared to females should decrease the average proportion of deleterious alleles carried on each paternally derived X ( e . g . , [10] , [33] ) , and thereby favor expressing the paternally inherited X . \u201cSexually antagonistic alleles\u201d \u2013 alleles that increase fitness when present in one sex , but decrease fitness in the other sex [37] , [38] \u2013 should have the opposite effect on X inactivation . Alleles benefiting males and costly to females experience higher probabilities of paternal transmission ( e . g . , [39] , [40] ) , which could generate selection to preferentially inactivate , or even ubiquitously silence , paternally inherited X chromosomes . Several models have examined how sexually antagonistic selection might favor the evolution genomic imprinting , which similarly involves the unequal expression of maternally and paternally inherited gene copies [40]\u2013[44] . However , the effect of sexually antagonistic fitness variation on X inactivation evolution has yet to be addressed . It is currently unclear how the population genetic parameters of dominance , sex-differential selection , and linkage and recombination might jointly influence the evolution of X inactivation strategies . We therefore developed a mathematical model of X inactivation evolution , and used this model to identify biological conditions that favor the evolution of different X inactivation states . We first consider the dichotomous case of RXI versus PXI , describe the conditions facilitating evolutionary transitions to RXI , and characterize the consequences of such transitions for mean fitness of males and females . Overall , selection on mammalian X inactivation strategies is primarily mediated by the interaction between dominance and sex-differential selection , and the situation differs considerably from scenarios that favor the evolution of diploidy . We also examine whether sex-differential selection might favor the evolution of biased X inactivation strategies ( i . e . , quantitatively unequal expression of maternally versus paternally derived X chromosomes ) and predict the magnitude of biases likely to evolve . Our results suggest that conditions for evolving biased inactivation patterns are extremely permissive . \n We focus on the simplest and most analytically tractable model that simultaneously incorporates genetic linkage , variation for fitness , and variation in the form of X inactivation . Our model follows the evolution of two bi-allelic loci . Locus A ( the \u201cfitness locus\u201d ) is X-linked and carries A1 and A2 alleles , which directly influence male and female fitness . Locus B ( the \u201cmodifier locus\u201d ) carries B1 and B2 alleles , which influence the X inactivation rule in females within the population . The genotype at locus B can influence female fitness through its effect on the relative expression of A1 versus A2 alleles in heterozygotes . Variation at the B locus has no other phenotypic effect in males or females and is therefore neutral in males . We consider two scenarios of linkage for the B locus . Under X-linkage , A and B are physically linked , and recombine at a rate r , per female meiosis ( the X does not recombine in males , which have only one X chromosome copy ) . When B is on an autosome , alleles at A and B loci segregate independently during meiosis . To model the evolution of X inactivation , we begin with the B locus initially fixed for allele B1 , and the A locus at polymorphic equilibrium given B1 fixed . We then characterize selection on and evolution of a novel B2 allele that changes a female carrier's X inactivation system . The population is assumed to be sufficiently large that genetic drift can be ignored , and each generation is discrete . The life cycle during each generation follows the order of birth , selection , recombination , mutation , random mating and syngamy . Our approach bears many similarities to models for the evolution of ploidy cycles ( e . g . , [26] , [45] chapter 8 of [46] ) , and for the evolution of sexually dimorphic genomic imprinting [40] , [44] , with which we draw contrasts . Generalized two-locus recursions ( see Methods ) include sixteen different female genotypes ( when allowing for parent-of-origin effects ) and at least four male genotypes ( four for the X-linked modifier model; eight for the autosomal modifier model ) . To reduce the enormous range of possible fitness parameterizations and initial population conditions , we focus our attention on a subset of idealized and biologically relevant population genetic scenarios in the following analyses . We consider two basic forms of fitness variation at the A locus ( Table 1 ) : ( 1 ) deleterious alleles maintained at a balance between recurrent mutation and purifying selection; and ( 2 ) sexually antagonistic alleles stably maintained as balanced polymorphisms . In both scenarios , the female-deleterious allele is denoted by A1 , i . e . female fitness is highest in A2 homozygotes , and fitness of heterozygous females is assumed to be intermediate to the two homozygous genotypes [formally , w ( A1A1 ) =\u200a1\u2212sf\u2264w ( A1A2 ) , w ( A2A1 ) \u2264w ( A2A2 ) =\u200a1 , where w ( AiAj ) is the fitness of a female with genotype AiAj , and sf describes the fitness cost to females of being homozygous or haploid for the A1 allele: 1>sf>0] . When A1 is also deleterious to males , it will be maintained at mutation-selection balance ( sm is the fitness cost to males of carrying an A1 allele; 1>sm>0; Table 1 ) . We also consider genetic polymorphism maintained by sexual antagonism , where A2 is the deleterious allele for males ( here , tm is the fitness cost to males of carrying an A2 allele; 1>tm>0; see Table 1 ) . In an ancestral population fixed for B1 , female somatic cell lineages are assumed to silence the paternally inherited X with probability \u03be11 and silence the maternal X with probability 1\u2212\u03be11 ( 0\u2264\u03be11\u22641 ) . Under unbiased RXI ( where \u03be11\u200a=\u200a\u00bd ) , heterozygous females have fitness w ( A1A2 ) =\u200aw ( A2A1 ) =\u200a1\u2212sfh , where h represents the degree of masking of the A1 allele ( 0<h<1 ) . Thus , h is a scaling factor that is analogous to the dominance coefficient of standard population genetic models . Use of the terms \u201cdominance\u201d and \u201crecessivity\u201d , applied to species with RXI , has been questioned because individual cells lack bi-allelic expression [47] . However , the dominance coefficient remains useful as a population genetic parameter , and simply quantifies the relative fitness of heterozygous versus homozygous genotypes when heterozygotes practice an unbiased RXI rule . Partial masking is clearly relevant for many X-linked disorders , which tend to be less penetrant and less severe in females than males [47] . When X inactivation is biased ( \u03be11\u2260\u00bd ) , fitness is function of h ( as defined above ) and parent-of-origin effects generated by the X inactivation rule . Assuming that female fitness decreases monotonically with the proportion of cells expressing the A1 allele , we can describe it using a generalized power function , w ( x ) =\u200a1\u2212xksf , where x represents the proportion of cells expressing the A1 allele , and k is a positive constant that describes the specific shape of the fitness decline associated with A1 expression ( such functions are often used in evolutionary theory because of their flexibility; e . g . , [48]\u2013[50] ) . For our purposes , w ( x ) has two essential properties . First , fitness approaches unity when A2 is ubiquitously expressed ( i . e . , ) , and 1\u2212sf when A1 is ubiquitously expressed ( i . e . , ) , which makes intuitive sense . Second , k can be defined in terms of the dominance coefficient of A1 . When \u03be11\u200a=\u200a\u00bd , x\u200a=\u200a\u03be11\u200a=\u200a1\u2212\u03be11; therefore , h\u200a=\u200a1/2k and k\u200a=\u200a\u2212ln ( h ) /ln ( 2 ) . A1 is partially dominant to A2 when h>\u00bd ( k<1 ) and partially recessive when h<\u00bd ( k>1 ) . Consequently , hmat\u200a=\u200a\u03be11k represents the effective dominance coefficient when A1 is maternally inherited , and hpat\u200a= ( 1\u2212\u03be11 ) k represents the effective dominance coefficient when A1 is paternally inherited ( Table 1; Figure 1 ) . Nonadditivity of allelic effects ( i . e . , h\u2260\u00bd ) can arise when the fitness of an X-linked genotype is not cell-autonomous ( e . g . , fitness depends on the overall proportion of A1 versus A2 expression in female bodies; [43] , [51] ) . With cell-autonomous effects , we can model total fitness as the mean fitness per cell [43] , such that w ( A1A2 ) =\u200a1\u2212\u03be11sf and w ( A2A1 ) =\u200a1\u2212 ( 1\u2212\u03be11 ) sf , which represents a special case of the generalized power function ( i . e . , k\u200a=\u200a1 and h\u200a=\u200a\u00bd ) . Given the outlined assumptions , we obtain the following equilibria with respect to the X-linked fitness-determining locus . When A1 is deleterious to both sexes , its equilibrium frequencies at mutation-selection balance ( in females and males , respectively ) are: ( 1 ) where u is the mutation rate to A1 , hmat\u200a=\u200a\u03be11k , and hpat\u200a= ( 1\u2212\u03be11 ) k , and k\u200a=\u200a\u2212ln ( h ) /ln ( 2 ) . Eq . ( 1 ) was previously derived in [52] ( see Text S1 ) . When A1 is sexually antagonistic ( i . e . , deleterious to females but beneficial to males ) , and with balancing selection acting at the A locus , the equilibrium frequencies of A1 are: ( 2 ) versions of which have been derived in several previous studies [43] , [52]\u2013[54] . The balancing selection criteria for sexually antagonistic polymorphism are provided ( Text S1; for additional results and discussion , see [43] , [52] , [54]\u2013[56] ) . PXI is thought to represent the ancestral X inactivation state , from which RXI evolved [1] , [57] . We therefore sought to define the population genetic conditions in which a rare B2 allele that causes unbiased RXI ( where \u03be12\u200a=\u200a\u00bd represents the X inactivation strategy played by individuals heterozygous at the modifier locus ) will invade a population that is initially fixed for the PXI strategy ( \u03be11\u200a=\u200a1 ) . Evolutionary transitions that influence gene ploidy levels ( e . g . , transitions from haploidy to diploidy ) permit deleterious mutations to accumulate within populations , and reduce long-term population fitness ( i . e . , the new equilibrium fitness [21] , [67]; however , epistasis can sometimes render diploidy advantageous [23] ) , which is why recombination is required for diploidy to evolve [26]\u2013[30] . Under tight linkage , alleles for diploidy are co-transmitted with deleterious mutations , and fitness benefits of masking can be outweighed by the increased burden of linked , deleterious mutations . Recombination decouples such associations , and permits diploidy to evolve , despite the long-term fitness cost . Such interactions between ploidy and recombination have parallels in various other aspects of genome evolution , including the evolution of genomic imprinting [44] , [68] and the establishment of gene duplicates [69] , [70] . In contrast , the evolution of RXI does not require recombination ( as shown above ) , and this insensitivity to linkage can similarly be considered in light of mean fitness changes that follow an evolutionary transition from PXI to RXI . For the mutation-selection balance model , equilibrium mean male and female fitnesses ( respectively ) under PXI and unbiased RXI are: ( 5a ) and ( 5b ) which each ignore terms of O ( u2 ) . For the parameter space where RXI can evolve [h<3/ ( 6\u22122sm+sf ) ; see eq . ( 3 ) ] , mean male fitness is always lower under RXI ( as long as sm>0; otherwise fitness does not change ) . Mean female fitness becomes higher , as the evolution of RXI shifts some of the burden of purifying selection ( removing deleterious mutations ) from females to males . The fitness cost to males at the new equilibrium is offset by fitness gains to females , which provides an intuitive explanation as to why selection for RXI is insensitive to linkage . Tightly linked deleterious alleles may hitchhike with a modifier for RXI , yet such associations do not overturn the net benefits of masking . For the case of an evolutionary transition from PXI to RXI driven by sexually antagonistic polymorphism [in the parameter space where RXI can evolve , i . e . : h< ( 1\u2212tm ) / ( 2\u2212tm ) ; see eq . ( 4 ) ] , the new equilibrium frequency of the male-beneficial/female-detrimental allele will be higher when tm<sf , and lower when tm>sf . Mean male fitness is therefore increased after the transition when sf>tm , decreased when sf<tm , and otherwise remains unchanged . The mean female fitness is increased under a much broader range of conditions , because the masking effect caused by RXI can sometimes offset a higher derived frequency of the female-deleterious allele . The condition necessary for female fitness to be increased following the evolution of RXI is: ( 6 ) where hcrit\u200a= ( 1\u2212tm ) / ( 2\u2212tm ) . As shown in Figure 3 , parameter conditions favoring the evolution of RXI generally lead to an increase in mean female fitness , whereas mean male fitness is increased in exactly half of the relevant parameter space . The new mean fitness is always increased in one sex at least , and in some cases , in both sexes . For the model of sexually antagonistic genetic variation , our analysis of the change in equilibrium mean fitness follows the evolution of the ancestrally polymorphic locus , and ignores any sexually antagonistic X-linked mutations that might enter the population following the transition to RXI . However , the parameter space that permits an X-linked sexually antagonistic polymorphism is larger under RXI than PXI , within the relevant parameter space where RXI can evolve ( PXI can nevertheless be more conducive to polymorphism under alternative dominance parameterizations [52] ) , and recessive sexually antagonistic alleles that benefit males weakly can more readily be maintained [54] , [71] . Therefore , the evolution of RXI could increase the parameter space that permits X-linked sexually antagonistic polymorphism . Antagonistically selected X-linked loci that could not establish balanced polymorphisms in the ancestral population with PXI may do so in an RXI population . In the longer-term , this could increase male and decrease female fitness , contingent on the specific distribution of male and female selection and dominance coefficients among sexually antagonistic mutations . Thus far we have shown that RXI can be favored by selection if female-detrimental alleles are sufficiently masked when heterozygous . However , selection might not necessarily favor the same rate of inactivation for maternally and paternally derived X chromosomes in females . Sex-differential selection generates allele frequency differences between males and females , which can favor differential expression of genes inherited from opposite-sex parents [40] . With respect to the mammalian X , polymorphism under sex-differential selection might favor the evolution of unequal inactivation rates between paternally and maternally derived X chromosomes; this is conceptually similar to genomic imprinting that involves partial , but unequal , expression of both of the parental gene copies [72]\u2013[79] . Because X inactivation is a female-limited trait , we expect that selection will favor preferential inactivation of the chromosome with a greater probability of carrying female-deleterious alleles . We tested this intuition by performing an invasion analysis ( [46] , chapter 12 ) to determine the evolutionary stability of different X inactivation strategies . To characterize the direction and magnitude of the bias favored by selection , we consider a population initially fixed for an arbitrary inactivation strategy , \u03be11 ( 0<\u03be11<1 ) , and at equilibrium for fitness variation given this strategy [e . g . , eqs . ( 1\u20132 ) ] , and identify the \u03be11 values that are stable to invasion by an allele that alters the X inactivation ratio of female carriers ( i . e . the \u201cevolutionarily stable strategies\u201d [80] ) . Under a mutation-selection balance model , the stable paternal X inactivation value ( ) is: ( 7 ) The exponent term [\u2212ln ( 2 ) /ln ( 2h ) ] is positive when A1 is at least partially recessive ( h<\u00bd ) , which we assume here and below , and the ratio determines the direction of bias favored by selection . Selection favors preferential inactivation of the paternal X when deleterious alleles are more frequently transmitted to progeny through males than females ( >\u00bd when <1 ) , and favors preferential inactivation of the maternal X when deleterious mutations are more frequently transmitted through females ( <\u00bd when >1 ) . Eq . ( 7 ) can be expressed as an explicit function of the selection and dominance coefficients by assuming that sfh\u226a1 ( this is biologically reasonable given the observed negative association between dominance and effect size of deleterious mutations [12] ) . The critical ratio becomes: ( 8 ) Selection favors preferential inactivation of the maternally derived X when sm>sfh , and the degree of bias may be pronounced when deleterious mutations are poorly masked in females ( e . g . , when h is closer to \u00bd than to zero; Figure 4 ) . Adopting the same analytical approach for the case of sexually antagonistic fitness variation , the equilibrium X inactivation rule is: ( 9 ) Given the stated parameter constraints ( h<\u00bd; 1>tm>0 ) , ( 1\u2212tm ) \u2212ln ( 2 ) /ln ( 2h ) will always be positive and less than one , and selection always favors preferential inactivation of the paternally inherited X chromosome . The magnitude of this bias increases with tm and h , similar to the deleterious mutation scenario for fitness variation ( Figure 4 ) . When either the selection or the dominance coefficient is sufficiently large , both models of fitness variation can favor large X inactivation biases . Some moderate values of s , t and h ( to the left of the x-axis in Figure 4 ) could lead to large enough biases \u2013 on the order of a few percent or more \u2013 to be empirically detectable . \n For reasons of tractability , and in parallel with theory on the evolution of diploidy ( e . g . , [26] , [45]; chapter 8 of [46] ) , we have focused our analysis on two-locus population genetics models to characterize how different forms of fitness variation and linkage will influence patterns of selection for different X inactivation rules . However , X inactivation affects the expression of many genes simultaneously , and unique patterns of genetic variation among X-linked loci could individually favor discordant X inactivation strategies . We can gain some insight into scenarios that involve multiple X-linked loci , under the assumption that each polymorphic locus contributes independently to selection on a rare , unlinked modifier allele ( i . e . , we assume loose linkage and no epistasis between fitness loci; net fitness effects of multi-gene haplotypes could instead apply under tight linkage between fitness loci ) . Under these conditions , criteria for invasion of a modifier allele will be , where \u03bbi is the leading eigenvalue associated with the two-locus system for the modifier locus and the ith of n X-linked fitness loci ( i\u200a=\u200a{1 , 2 , \u2026 , n} ) [84] , [85] . With weak effects of individual fitness loci on the modifier ( i . e . , \u03bbi\u22481 ) , the selection coefficient associated with a rare modifier allele will be smod\u2248nE ( \u03bbi\u22121 ) , where E ( \u03bbi\u22121 ) represents the arithmetic mean , and \u03bbi\u22121 represents selection contributed by the ith locus ( invasion of the modifier allele requires that smod>0 ) . To the extent that X-linked loci segregate for deleterious alleles , and these have similar selection and dominance coefficients , the net effects of multiple X-linked loci on a modifier will be reinforcing , and the strength of selection on the X inactivation strategy will increase with the number of contributing loci ( i . e . , if E ( \u03bbi\u22121 ) \u22600 , then smod scales approximately linearly with n , the number of contributing loci; this scaling is in agreement with multilocus models for the evolution of diploidy [28] ) . Although little available data directly bear upon the sex-specific selection and dominance parameters of mammalian X-linked mutations , data from other systems suggest that most mutations have small , at least partially recessive fitness effects ( e . g . , [12]\u2013[15] , [86] ) , and are deleterious to both sexes [35] , [36] . If X-linked mutations have similarly small selection and dominance coefficients under RXI , then fitness variation due to deleterious alleles might favor the evolution of relatively unbiased RXI rules . Genes that are polymorphic for sexually antagonistic alleles could exert disproportionately strong influence on the evolutionary trajectories of X inactivation evolution . Sexually antagonistic alleles generate selection of a higher order of magnitude than loci at mutation-selection balance ( Figure S1 ) . Consequently , selection due to sexually antagonistic polymorphism may plausibly eclipse the cumulative effects of selection from deleterious alleles . The relative contribution of deleterious versus antagonistically selected alleles to X-linked fitness variation is ultimately an empirical question . To the extent that sexually antagonistic fitness variation is common in mammalian populations ( as may indeed be the case; e . g . , [60] , [64] ) , selection should favor the evolution of biased inactivation of the paternally inherited X . Conflicts between different X-linked loci over the optimal ratio of maternal to paternal X inactivation could potentially be resolved by the evolution of genomic imprinting at individual X-linked genes . Previous models have considered two scenarios of sexually antagonistic selection driving the evolution of imprinting ( i . e . , the partial or complete silencing of a maternally or a paternally inherited copy of a single gene; [72]\u2013[79] ) . First , when the optimal transcription level of a X-linked gene differs between males and females , imprinting can facilitate sex-specific adaptation by generating sexually dimorphic gene expression [41] , [42] . Imprinting of the maternally inherited gene is favored under selection for higher transcription levels in females , whereas paternal imprinting is favored at genes selected for higher transcription in males [41]\u2013[43] . Second , in genes polymorphic for sexually antagonistic alleles , sexually dimorphic imprinting can mitigate fitness costs of inheriting harmful alleles , which are preferentially transmitted from opposite-sex parents [40] . Existing models of this latter scenario consider polymorphism and imprinting at an autosomal gene [40] , [44] , yet the basic processes should apply to the X ( as discussed in [40] ) \u2013 particularly so because X-linkage promotes allele frequency differences and asymmetrical imprinting effects between males and females [41] , [42] , [87] . X inactivation and gene-by-gene imprinting may serve as complementary mechanisms for optimizing male and female fitness . Evolution of RXI from an ancestral population with PXI should be relatively unconstrained , provided three conditions are met: ( i ) there is genetic variation for RXI ( i . e . , it is evolvable; see above ) ; ( ii ) X-linked fitness variation is largely caused by segregating deleterious mutations; and ( iii ) the fitness costs of these mutations are at least partially masked under RXI ( i . e . , h<\u00bd , as seems likely ) . The availability of mutations to RXI could potentially constrain the convergent evolution of RXI in marsupials [18] . Sexually antagonistic X-linked fitness variability , if common within marsupials , could also promote the evolutionary maintenance of PXI . This hypothesis is plausible , given the pronounced sexual size dimorphism in marsupials relative to other mammalian species ( e . g . , [88] , [89] ) . Such dimorphism is indicative of strong sexual selection , which could promote the accumulation of sexually antagonistic genetic variation and thereby limit opportunities to evolve RXI . Once RXI has evolved , evolutionary reversals to strict PXI should face severe evolutionary constraints . In populations with RXI , the filtering of genetic variation by selection in females will strongly depend upon dominance . RXI permits the preferential accumulation of recessive , female-deleterious mutations , because such alleles experience weakened purifying selection . The retention of recessive alleles in populations with RXI should downwardly shift the mean dominance of segregating alleles ( relative to the dominance coefficients of spontaneous mutations; e . g . , [12] , [90] ) , and increase the cost to females of becoming homozygous or effectively haploid , as they would under PXI . Filtering of mutations based on their dominance coefficients does not eliminate opportunities to evolve biased RXI , but it should severely constrain evolutionary transitions to complete PXI , which completely eliminates effects of masking . This situation is analogous to the coevolution of outcrossing rates and inbreeding depression , with the latter expected to become more severe in outbreeding populations because they shelter recessive alleles from natural selection [91] , [92] . Species-specific properties of mutation and genetic variation might predictably affect patterns of selection for different X inactivation strategies . Sexual selection and sex-biased mutation rates are each likely to vary among species , and both processes can influence the relative transmission probabilities of female-deleterious alleles between maternally and paternally derived X chromosomes . Mammalian mutation rates are often higher in males than females [93] , [94] , which tends to upwardly bias paternal transmission of deleterious alleles . Consider a population with unbiased RXI and a mutation rate of um and uf in males and females , respectively ( see Text S1 ) . With unbiased mutation ( um\u200a=\u200auf ) , selection can favor reduced expression of the maternally inherited X when sfh<sm , as implied by eq . ( 8 ) . Male-biased mutation ( um/uf>1 ) reduces this parameter space to ( um/uf ) sfh<sm , because males transmit a higher fraction of de-novo mutations to their daughters . We predict that preferential inactivation of the paternally inherited X will be more common ( or more severe ) in species with strongly male-biased mutation rates . Sexual selection could similarly favor paternally biased X inactivation . Although strong purifying selection in males via sexual selection can reduce paternal transmission rates of deleterious alleles ( [33] , [35] , [36]; though not all data support this possibility , e . g . : [95] , [96] ) , it will also reduce the frequencies and contributions of deleterious alleles to fitness variation in females . Sexual selection may simultaneously increase the pervasiveness of sexual antagonism [97] and the contribution of sexually antagonistic alleles to female fitness variation . If sexually antagonistic fitness variation increases with the strength of sexual selection , then so should the degree of paternally biased X inactivation . \n When the modifier locus , B , is linked to an autosome , the haplotype recursions can again be obtained using similar approaches as described above . Here , the frequency of each haplotype in females will be the same as described above for the specific case of free recombination: r\u200a=\u200a\u00bd . Haplotype frequencies in males , following selection and meiosis , are modified to: ( 14 ) where m1\u200a=\u200am3 , m2\u200a=\u200am4 , and M\u200a= ( x1+x3 ) m1+ ( x2+x4 ) m2 . Stability analysis ( invasion opportunities for rare B2 alleles ) follows the same approach as before , with initial conditions of variation at locus A remaining unchanged . Under the case of variation maintained by sexually antagonistic selection , effects of mutation are ignored ( we set u to zero ) . The generic characteristic polynomial is: ( 15 ) with the partial derivatives each evaluated at the equilibrium: =\u200ax1\u200a=\u200a1\u2212x2 , =\u200ay1\u200a=\u200a1\u2212y2 , and x3\u200a=\u200ax4\u200a=\u200ay3\u200a=\u200ay4\u200a=\u200a0 .

Here , we investigated the antiviral potential of human ZAP ( isoform ZAP-L and ZAP-S ) against three flaviviruses , Japanese encephalitis virus ( JEV ) , dengue virus ( DENV ) and Zika virus ( ZIKV ) . Infection of JEV but not DENV or ZIKV was blocked by ZAP overexpression , and depletion of endogenous ZAP enhanced JEV replication . ZAP hampered JEV translation and targeted viral RNA for 3\u2032-5\u2032 RNA exosome-mediated degradation . The zinc-finger motifs of ZAP were essential for RNA targeting and anti-JEV activity . JEV 3\u2032-UTR , especially in the region with dumbbell structures and high content of CG dinucleotide , was mapped to bind ZAP and confer sensitivity to ZAP . In summary , we identified JEV as the first ZAP-sensitive flavivirus . ZAP may act as an intrinsic antiviral factor through specific RNA binding to fight against JEV infection . \n Zinc-finger CCCH-type containing , antiviral 1 ( ZC3HAV1 ) also known as zinc-finger antiviral protein ( ZAP ) was first discovered in rats as a host antiviral protein against Moloney murine leukemia virus [1] . Later , multiple RNA and DNA viruses , like retroviruses , filoviruses , alphaviruses , and hepatitis B virus were shown to display sensitivity to ZAP [2\u20136] . However , ZAP does not induce a universal antiviral state , since viruses such as herpes simplex virus 1 ( HSV-1 ) , vesicular stomatitis virus and yellow fever virus ( YFV ) are resistant to ZAP [4] . Furthermore , viruses within the same family may exhibit different sensitivity to ZAP . For example , in the family Picornaviridae , ZAP inhibited coxsackievirus B3 but not poliovirus infection [4 , 7] . In humans , ZAP contains two major isoforms ( ZAP-L and ZAP-S ) , which differ in the C-terminal region through alternative splicing [8] . In the N-terminus of ZAP , there are four CCCH-type zinc-finger motifs , which are required for RNA binding and antiviral property [9] . ZAP exhibits antiviral activity generally via posttranscriptional RNA regulation , such as mRNA decay and translation inhibition . ZAP recruits the RNA processing exosome complex and poly ( A ) -specific ribonuclease ( PARN ) to degrade the target RNA from the 3\u2032-end [6 , 10] . ZAP also interacts with p72 RNA helicase to recruit decapping enzymes DCP1/DCP2 and exoribonuclease XRN1 to degrade the target RNA from the 5\u2032-end [6 , 11] . Besides targeting RNA accumulation , ZAP can block translation of incoming viral RNA of Sindbis virus ( SINV ) [4] probably by interrupting the interaction between translational initiation factors eIF4A and eIF4G [12] . Moreover , ZAP-S can associate with retinoic acid-inducible gene I ( RIG-I ) , a key sensor to recognize viral RNA , to promote the innate immune response and contribute to its antiviral potential [13] . Flaviviruses include numerous important human pathogens such as YFV , West Nile virus ( WNV ) , Zika virus ( ZIKV ) , dengue virus ( DENV ) and Japanese encephalitis virus ( JEV ) , causing endemic or pandemic outbreaks in tropical and subtropical areas [14] . Flaviviral virions are enveloped and contain a single-stranded , positive-sense RNA genome with 5\u2032-cap but not 3\u2032-poly ( A ) tail . Flavivirus RNA encodes a single open reading frame ( ORF ) flanked by 5\u2032- and 3\u2032-untranslated regions ( UTRs ) , which contain RNA secondary structures required for viral translation and transcription [15 , 16] . YFV was resistant to the antiviral activity of rat ZAP [4] , but the susceptibility of other flaviviruses to ZAP is not clear . In this study , we determined the antiviral activity of ZAP against JEV , DENV , and ZIKV and found different viral responses to ZAP . We further demonstrated the antiviral mechanism of ZAP against JEV infection . \n To evaluate the antiviral potential of human ZAP against members of flavivirus , we established A549 cells overexpressing ZAP-L and ZAP-S by lentiviral transduction . Cells with or without ZAP overexpression were infected with JEV , DENV or ZIKV and analyzed for viral replication . As compared with control EGFP cells , JEV infection measured by viral propagation , viral NS3 protein expression , and viral RNA replication were lower in cells ectopically overexpressing ZAP-L and ZAP-S ( Fig 1A\u20131C ) . The inhibitory effect of ZAP-L/S against JEV infection was also noted in the induced pluripotent stem cells ( iPSCs ) -derived human neural progenitor cells ( hNPCs ) , human microglia HMC3 cell line , as well as human neuroblastoma BE ( 2 ) C and SK-N-SH cell lines ( S1 Fig ) . Nevertheless , no significant antiviral effect of ZAP was observed after high and low multiplicity of infection ( MOI ) of DENV and ZIKV ( Fig 1D\u20131F , S2 and S3 Figs ) . Thus , different flaviviruses exhibit different sensitivity to the antiviral activity of ZAP . Viruses may downregulate the expression of ZAP and/or block its functions to evade the ZAP-mediated antiviral action [17\u201320] . To understand why DENV was resistant to ZAP , we detected the endogenous protein levels of ZAPs in JEV or DENV-infected cells and no reduction of ZAPs was noted ( S4 Fig ) . The antiviral activity of ZAP against SINV was also not obstructed by DENV infection ( S5 Fig ) , implying that DENV did not antagonize the antiviral activity of ZAP . Other mechanisms , besides affecting ZAP expression and function , need to be considered . To investigate the antiviral potential of endogenous ZAP , A549-shZAP-L/S cells deprived of ZAP expression were established by transduction with lentiviral vector expressing shRNA targeting both ZAP-L and ZAP-S ( Fig 2A ) . As compared to the control shLacZ cells , shZAP-L/S cells supported significantly higher levels of JEV infection as indicated by a 2 . 87- and 3 . 08-fold increase in viral RNA and viral progeny production , respectively ( Fig 2B and 2C ) . Furthermore , knockdown of ZAP in human neuronal BE ( 2 ) C cells enhanced JEV replication , supporting the anti-JEV role of endogenous ZAP in neuronal cells ( S6 Fig ) . Since JEV replication occurs at the surface of the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) membrane in the cytoplasm [21] , and ZAP predominantly localizes to the cytoplasm [22] , we examined whether ZAP co-localized with JEV viral RNA . A549 cells with or without JEV infection were processed for immunofluorescence analysis with anti-dsRNA antibody for viral replication complex [23 , 24] and anti-ZAP antibody for endogenous ZAP protein . Co-localization of dsRNA and ZAP was seen at the viral replication sites in JEV-infected cells ( Fig 2D and 2E ) . Furthermore , we applied immunoprecipitation/RT-PCR assay using antibody against endogenous ZAP to evaluate the interaction of ZAP with JEV viral RNA . ZAP-L and ZAP-S precipitated by anti-ZAP antibody also pulled down JEV RNA ( Fig 2F ) , indicating association between ZAP proteins and JEV RNA . To understand the anti-JEV mechanism of ZAP , we looked at whether RNA binding is required by generating constructs expressing the zinc-finger ( ZF ) domains deleted ZAP-L and ZAP-S ( ZAP-L/S-del4ZFs ) ( Fig 3A ) . We first tested the binding ability of wild type ( WT ) and ZF-deleted ZAP with JEV viral RNA by immunoprecipitation/RT-PCR assay . The V5-tagged WT ZAP-L and ZAP-S precipitated by anti-V5 antibody also pulled down JEV RNA , which was not seen in ZF-deleted ZAP and EGFP control ( Fig 3B ) . Furthermore , the anti-JEV activity of ZAP was greatly reduced in the ZF-deleted mutants as shown by viral NS3 protein expression , viral RNA replication , and viral progeny production ( Fig 3C\u20133E ) . Thus , the zinc-finger motifs of ZAP were essential for RNA targeting and antiviral activity against JEV infection . To explore why DENV was resistant to the antiviral action of ZAP , we determined whether ZAP associated with DENV viral RNA . Interestingly , ZAP did not bring down DENV RNA while it readily pulled down the cellular TRAILR4 mRNA ( S7 Fig ) known to bind with ZAP [25] , suggesting that RNA-binding ability may dictate the antiviral potential of ZAP . After entering the cells , JEV RNA undergoes a first round of translation to produce nonstructural proteins required for viral RNA replication . To assess whether viral translation was affected by ZAP , we detected viral protein expression in ZAP- and EGFP-overexpressing cells at early time points of JEV infection . Lower JEV NS3 protein expression was noted in cells with ZAP overexpression starting from 2 hours post-infection ( hpi ) ( Fig 4A and 4B ) . We also monitored the viral RNA levels in cells with or without ZAP overexpression by RT-qPCR . No significant difference was found at 2 hpi , but ZAP significantly reduced JEV RNA since 3 hpi ( Fig 4C ) . To further address whether the decrease of viral protein at early time point of JEV infection is through repressing translation and/or reducing viral RNA , we used replication-dead JEV replicon RNA ( Fig 4D ) to transfect 293T/17 cells with or without ZAP overexpression ( Fig 4E ) . The cell lysates were separated into two portions for measurements of luciferase activity and RNA level . Reduction of luciferase activity was noted in cells with ZAP overexpression since 1 h post-transfection when the RNA level was not yet affected ( Fig 4F ) , suggesting repression of viral translation by ZAP . To clarify whether ZAP influenced JEV viral RNA stability , we also used replication-dead JEV replicon RNA for longer time points . A decrease in replicon RNA was noted at 3 h and 9 h post-transfection in cells with ZAP overexpression as compared to those with EGFP control ( Fig 4G ) , suggesting that ZAP promoted JEV viral RNA decay . Thus , ZAP inhibited JEV translation and impaired viral RNA stability . ZAP modulates target RNA by recruiting cellular 5\u2032-3\u2032 XRN1-dependent and 3\u2032-5\u2032 RNA exosome-dependent RNA decay machineries [6 , 10] . To evaluate whether cellular RNA decay machineries participated in the anti-JEV activity of ZAP , we depleted the expression of XRN1 or EXOSC5 in ZAP-L , ZAP-S and EGFP-overexpressing cells by using a shRNA-targeting approach . Compared with the shLacZ control , knockdown of XRN1 did not affect the anti-JEV activity of ZAP ( Fig 5A\u20135C ) , whereas the anti-JEV effect of ZAP was hampered by knockdown of EXOSC5 ( Fig 5D\u20135F ) . The data suggest that 3\u2032-5\u2032 RNA degradation by the exosome complex is involved in the antiviral mechanism of ZAP against JEV infection . To address whether ZAP boosted innate immune responses during JEV infection , we measured the mRNA levels of type I IFN and proinflammatory cytokines in A549 cells with or without ZAP overexpression . As compared with the EGFP control , ZAP-L and ZAP-S slightly increased the basal level of IFN-\u03b2 , TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 ( Fig 6A\u20136C ) , as well as chemokines CXCL10 and CCL5 ( S8 Fig ) in uninfected cells as previously reported [13] , and further increased the expression of these cytokines/chemokines in JEV-infected A549 cells ( Fig 6A\u20136C , S8 Fig ) . We further determined the upstream RLRs involved in the sensing events by knocking down the expression of RIG-I or MDA5 by lentiviral transduction ( Fig 6D ) . Compared with the shLacZ control , knockdown of RIG-I , but not MDA-5 , reduced the induction of interferon-stimulated genes ( ISGs ) , e . g . , IFIT1 , IFIT3 , and ISG15 that was seen in ZAP overexpressing cells ( Fig 6E and 6F ) , indicating that ZAP-enhanced innate immune responses mainly went through the RIG-I signaling pathway in JEV-infected cells . Interestingly , knockdown of MDA5 even elevated the induction of ISGs ( Fig 6F ) , similarly to a previous report showing higher IFN-\u03b2 production in MDA5-/- but not RIG-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts infected with JEV [26] . Thus , deprive of MDA5 in JEV-infected cells might trigger some compensational IFN-related signaling events through unclear mechanism . Moreover , the anti-JEV effect of ZAP measured by viral NS3 protein expression was still noted in cells deprived of RIG-I with decreased ISGs expression ( Fig 6E ) as well as in the type I IFN-deficient Vero cells with ectopic ZAP expression ( S9 Fig ) . Thus , ZAP-enhanced innate immune response was not involved in the anti-JEV effect , probably because JEV can block the JAK-STAT pathway and is somewhat resistant to type I IFN [27 , 28] . Both RNA sequence and structure have been considered as important for ZAP recognition [29 , 30]; however , the common features of ZAP-responsive elements ( ZRE ) are still inconclusive . To elucidate the possible regions of JEV genome targeted by ZAP , we performed UV crosslinking and immunoprecipitation ( CLIP ) to pull down the RNA interacting with ZAP in JEV-infected ZAP-S overexpressing A549 cells . The enriched RNA population was subjected to next generation sequencing ( NGS ) by use of the Ion Torrent platform . The read coverages of several peaks/regions were above the average read coverage especially within the JEV 3\u2032-UTR ( Fig 7A ) . We thus focused on 5\u2032- and 3\u2032-UTR , which contain conserved complementary sequences and extensive secondary structures to regulate viral translation and transcription [15 , 16] , to elucidate the potential ZRE in the JEV genome . We designed reporter constructs containing the 5\u2032 197 nt . ( 5\u2032-UTR plus the first 102 nt . of the core gene ) and/or the entire 3\u2032-UTR flanking firefly luciferase ( Fluc ) in the pGL3-promoter vector under a SP6 promoter ( Fig 7B , left panel ) . The in vitro transcribed reporter RNA and control Renilla luciferase ( Rluc ) RNA were cotransfected into 293T/17 cells with or without ZAP-S overexpression . As compared with the EGFP control , ZAP did not influence the luciferase activity of the reporter RNA with 5\u2032-UTR197 , while ZAP significantly reduced those with 3\u2032-UTR ( Fig 7B , right panel ) , revealing the possible ZRE in the JEV 3\u2032-UTR . In vitro RNA pull-down assay also confirmed that the interaction between ZAP-S and JEV 3\u2032-UTR in a ZF domain dependent manner ( Fig 7C ) was stronger than that with 5\u2032-UTR197 ( S10 Fig ) . To further evaluate the possible ZRE in the 3\u2032-UTR of JEV genome , CLIP-seq results within the three defined domains of JEV 3\u2032-UTR: domain I ( variable region ) , domain II ( dumbbell structure ) and domain III ( 3\u2032 conserved sequence and terminal stem-loop ) [31] are shown ( Fig 8A ) . We measured the binding ability of these RNA domains with ZAP by using biotinylated RNA . The proteins pulled down by streptavidin were subjected to western blotting with anti-V5 antibody for ZAP-S level . Domain II ( showing a 45% binding ability of the full-length ) had the strongest interaction with ZAP when compared to domain I ( 12% of the full-length ) and domain III ( 3% of the full-length ) of the JEV 3\u2032-UTR RNA ( Fig 8B ) . Interestingly , domain II contained high frequency of CG dinucleotide ( Fig 8A ) , which was recently reported to confer ZAP binding and recognition [32] . Furthermore , the binding of ZAP to domain I+II RNA containing most of the CG dinucleotides reached 88% of the full length 3\u2032-UTR RNA ( Fig 8B ) . To verify the regions targeted by ZAP , we generated five reporter RNAs containing domain I , II , III , I+II , and II+III , respectively ( Fig 8C , left panel ) . Significant reduction of luciferase activity by ZAP-S was noted in the reporters with WT , domain II , domain I+II and domain II+III , indicating the importance of domain II in conferring the sensitivity to ZAP ( Fig 8C , right panel ) . Thus , domain II of JEV 3\u2032-UTR containing dumbbell structures and high content of CG dinucleotide may function as ZRE and contribute to ZAP sensitivity . \n ZAP exhibits antiviral activity against a variety of viruses , but flaviviruses were not known to be sensitive to ZAP until this study . Here , we demonstrate that overexpression of human ZAP ( isoforms ZAP-L and ZAP-S ) inhibited JEV infection and downregulation of endogenous ZAP enhanced JEV replication , indicating the intrinsic antiviral potential of ZAP . We also found that , similar to YFV [4] , DENV and ZIKV are resistant to ZAP , supporting the notion that ZAP is not a universal antiviral factor even for viruses within the same family . Viruses may use different strategies to evade the ZAP-mediated antiviral action , but it is still not fully understood what determines the sensitivity of a virus to ZAP . Influenza A virus NS1 protein antagonizes ZAP-S by interrupting its binding to target mRNA [19] . Murine gammaherpesvirus 68 RTA inhibits the antiviral activity of ZAP by disrupting the N-terminal intermolecular interaction of ZAP [20] . HSV-1 UL41 endoribonuclease was identified as an antagonist of human ZAP by degrading its mRNA [17] . Enterovirus 71 3C protease mediates the cleavage of ZAP protein [18] . In our hands , DENV neither downregulated the expression of ZAP nor blocked the antiviral activity of ZAP ( S4 and S5 Figs ) . However , we were able to detect the interaction of ZAP with JEV RNA ( Figs 2F and 3B ) but not with DENV RNA ( S7 Fig ) , consistent with the antiviral potential of ZAP against JEV but not DENV . Thus , the resistance of DENV to ZAP might be resulted from a failure of ZAP to bind with DENV viral RNA . Recently , viral RNA with high CG dinucleotide content was found to be targeted by ZAP , and ZAP bound directly and selectively to RNA sequences containing CG dinucleotides [32] . The known ZAP-sensitive virus genomes contained relatively higher CG frequencies , such as ZAP-sensitive SINV ( 0 . 9 ) vs . ZAP-resistant YFV ( 0 . 38 ) [32] . Interestingly , the ZAP-sensitive JEV genome also has a relatively higher CG frequency ( 0 . 61 ) as compared to that of ZAP-resistant ZIKV ( 0 . 46 ) and DENV ( 0 . 36 ) . Moreover , we detected the interaction of ZAP with JEV RNA ( Figs 2F and 3B ) but not with DENV RNA ( S7 Fig ) . Thus , JEV RNA enriched with CG dinucleotides may be targeted by ZAP binding to trigger the antiviral effect . Our crosslinking-immunoprecipitation-sequencing assay showed several peaks of ZAP binding in the JEV 3\u2032-UTR , and domain II of JEV 3\u2032-UTR with high frequencies of CG dinucleotide was further mapped as the major ZRE ( Figs 7 and 8 ) . Since domain II also contains stem-loop and pseudoknot structures [31 , 33] , the contribution of RNA secondary structures in addition to CG dinucleotides in ZAP recognition cannot be ruled out . ZAP-S serves as a key regulator of RIG-I-mediated innate immune responses for type I IFN production to limit the infection of influenza A virus and Newcastle disease virus . Besides , ZAP-S also enhances NF-\u03baB and IRF3 signaling downstream of RIG-I for the induction of proinflammatory cytokines , like TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 [13] . In this study , we showed that ZAP promoted the production of IFN-\u03b2 , TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 during JEV infection ( Fig 6A\u20136C ) . It has been speculated that elevated IFNs , TNF-\u03b1 , and IL-6 during viral infection correlated with the severity and outcome of viral diseases . Similarly , IFNs and proinflammatory cytokines including TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 were elevated in patients with acute Japanese encephalitis [34\u201336] . Thus , the induction of IFN and proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines by ZAP may contribute to host defense responses as well as the JEV-induced inflammatory states and pathogenesis during JEV infection . ZAP restricted JEV infection mainly by posttranscriptional regulation such as blocking protein translation and enhancing RNA degradation . Through interaction with XRN1 and exosome components , like Rrp46 ( EXOSC5 ) , Rrp40 ( EXOSC3 ) and Rrp42 ( EXOSC7 ) [6 , 10] , ZAP utilizes cellular RNA decay machineries to destabilize both viral and cellular RNAs . ZAP binds with 5\u2032-UTR of HIV-1 nef mRNA and 3\u2032-UTR of cellular TRAILR4 mRNA and then requires RNA exosome , and potentially XRN1 , to degrade the target RNAs [6 , 25] . The anti-JEV effect of ZAP was diminished by knockdown of the exosome component ( Fig 5D\u20135F ) , indicating the involvement of 3\u2032-5\u2032 RNA decay in the ZAP antiviral pathway . Thus , ZAP can bind with JEV RNA and target the viral RNA to the 3\u2032-5\u2032 RNA exosome complex for RNA degradation . Furthermore , XRN1-dependent RNA decay is known to generate subgenomic flavivirus RNA ( sfRNA ) [37 , 38] , which can then block XRN1 activity and alter host mRNA stability [39] . Interestingly , XRN1 was not involved in the anti-JEV activity of ZAP ( Fig 5A\u20135C ) , probably due to the interplay between XRN1 and sfRNA in JEV-infected cells prevailing the involvement of XRN1 in the antiviral action of ZAP . Since ZAP not only restricts viral infection but also regulates cellular mRNA abundance [25] , we cannot exclude the possibility that the blocking effect of ZAP on JEV is due to the altered cellular mRNA and protein expression . Overall , we have identified JEV as the first flavivirus sensitive to human ZAP and provide insight about the antiviral mechanism of ZAP against viral RNA without 3\u2032-poly ( A ) tail . \n Neurovirulent JEV RP-9 strain plaque-purified from a Taiwanese NT109 isolate ( GenBank accession: AF014161 ) [40] , DENV-2 PL046 strain ( GenBank accession: KJ734727 ) [41] and ZIKV PRVABC59 strain ( 2015 Puerto Rico strain , GenBank accession: KU501215 ) were propagated in mosquito C6/36 cells ( ATCC , CRL-1660 ) maintained in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) .

Human NPCs ( hNPCs ) were generated from human skin fibroblast reprogrammed hiPSCs [43] from healthy donor following the procedure described previously [44] .

Lipofectamine 2000 reagent ( Invitrogen ) was used for DNA and RNA transfection . 293T/17 cells were cotransfected with shRNA expressing pLKO . 1 lentiviral construct or protein expressing pSIN lentiviral construct plus 2 helper plasmids , pMD . G and pCMV\u0394R8 . 91 , using Lipofectamine 2000 . For shRNA expressing lentiviruses , culture supernatants containing lentiviral particles were harvested and stored at 80\u00b0C .

After lentiviral transduction , cells were selected by 10 \u03bcg/mL puromycin ( InvivoGen ) for stable cell line establishment . The cDNA of human ZAP-L ( NM_020119 ) was amplified from interferon ( IFN ) -treated A549 cells with the primer sequences 5\u2032-CGCCATGGCGGACCCGGAGGTG-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-ACTAATCACGCAGGCTTTGTCTTCAGT-3\u2032 , and cloned into pcDNA3 . 1/V5-His vector by TOPO-TA cloning ( K4800 , Invitrogen ) .

The portions of ZAP-L and ZAP-S fused with V5-tag were further subcloned to the self-inactivating lentiviral vector ( pSIN ) , in which the expression of an inserted gene is under the control of a constitutive spleen focus-forming virus ( SFFV ) promoter [46] . The zinc-finger domains deleted ZAP-L and ZAP-S were generated by single-primer mutagenesis with the ZAP-del4ZFs ( 73\u2013193 ) primer ( 5\u2032-ACCACTCGAGCCCGGGTC/ATGGACAGAAAGGTGCTGGCCATCA-3\u2032 ) . JEV 5\u2032+3\u2032-UTR/pGL3-promoter plasmid consisted of a SV40 promoter upstream of a firefly luciferase ( Fluc ) gene flanked by the 5\u2032-UTR plus partial core gene ( nt . 1\u2013197 ) at its 5\u2032-end and the 3\u2032-UTR ( nt . 10392\u201310977 ) at its 3\u2032-end .

Anti-JEV NS3 and anti-DENV NS3 antibodies were described previously [41 , 47] .

PCR was then performed by using the primers described in S1 Table . For real-time qPCR , random hexamer primer was used for reverse transcription and qPCR was performed by ABI-Prism 7500 real-time PCR system ( Applied Biosystems ) . The relative RNA levels of specific RNA were normalized with GAPDH or firefly luciferase , and calculated by the comparative threshold cycle ( \u0394\u0394Ct ) method .

JEV 5\u2032-UTR197 and 3\u2032-UTR ( full length , domain I , domain II , domain III , and domain I+II ) DNA templates for in vitro transcription of biotinylated RNA probes were amplified from JEV 5\u2032+3\u2032-UTR/pGL3-promoter plasmid . Biotin-labeled RNAs were synthesized by adding additional 2 . 5 \u03bcL of 10 mM biotin-16-UTP ( Roche ) into a 50 \u03bcL in vitro transcription mixture . After incubation at 37\u00b0C for 3 h , template DNA was removed with RNase-free DNase I . Synthesized RNAs were purified by Direct-zol RNA kit ( Zymo Research ) and quality checked by agarose electrophoresis . The primer sets for the specific PCR products above are described in S2 Table . Different amounts ( 0 , 1 , 5 , and 10 pmole ) of biotin-labeled RNA probe were incubated with 100 \u03bcg of ZAP-S-V5 or ZAP-S-del4ZFs expressing A549 cell extracts lysed by CHAPS lysis buffer ( 10 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7 . 4] , 1 mM MgCl2 , 1 mM EGTA , 0 . 5% CHAPS , 10% glycerol , and 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol ) containing protease inhibitor cocktail in a final volume of 100 \u03bcl of RNA binding buffer ( 10 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7 . 5] , 50 mM NaCl , 1 mM EDTA , and 10 \u03bcM ZnCl2 ) supplemented with 1 unit/\u03bcl RNasin ( Promega ) , 1 \u03bcg/\u03bcl heparin ( Sigma-Aldrich ) and 100 ng/\u03bcl yeast tRNA ( Roche ) for 30 min at 30\u00b0C .

{"lay_summary": "Rift Valley fever virus ( RVFV ) is a deadly virus that is found primarily in sub-Saharan Africa . However , mosquitoes that are capable of transmitting RVFV have a worldwide distribution .

In this study we evaluated the host response to infection with either a RVFV vaccine strain or a wild-type strain to identify similarities or differences that could be exploited for development of therapeutics or improved vaccines .

Analyzing multiple clinical factors and the host immune response over the course of infection allowed us to identify potential host factors associated with disease progression during wild-type virus infection . This work also provides support for a current vaccine candidate , MP-12 , in demonstrating a limited and protective host response to infection .", "article": "Rift Valley fever virus ( RVFV ) is a major human and animal pathogen associated with severe disease including hemorrhagic fever or encephalitis . RVFV is endemic to parts of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula , but there is significant concern regarding its introduction into non-endemic regions and the potentially devastating effect to livestock populations with concurrent infections of humans . To date , there is little detailed data directly comparing the host response to infection with wild-type or vaccine strains of RVFV and correlation with viral pathogenesis . Here we characterized clinical and systemic immune responses to infection with wild-type strain ZH501 or IND vaccine strain MP-12 in the C57BL/6 mouse . Animals infected with live-attenuated MP-12 survived productive viral infection with little evidence of clinical disease and minimal cytokine response in evaluated tissues . In contrast , ZH501 infection was lethal , caused depletion of lymphocytes and platelets and elicited a strong , systemic cytokine response which correlated with high virus titers and significant tissue pathology . Lymphopenia and platelet depletion were indicators of disease onset with indications of lymphocyte recovery correlating with increases in G-CSF production . RVFV is hepatotropic and in these studies significant clinical and histological data supported these findings; however , significant evidence of a pro-inflammatory response in the liver was not apparent . Rather , viral infection resulted in a chemokine response indicating infiltration of immunoreactive cells , such as neutrophils , which was supported by histological data . In brains of ZH501 infected mice , a significant chemokine and pro-inflammatory cytokine response was evident , but with little pathology indicating meningoencephalitis . These data suggest that RVFV pathogenesis in mice is associated with a loss of liver function due to liver necrosis and hepatitis yet the long-term course of disease for those that might survive the initial hepatitis is neurologic in nature which is supported by observations of human disease and the BALB/c mouse model . \n Rift Valley fever virus ( RVFV ) ( family Bunyaviridae , genus Phlebovirus ) is a highly pathogenic virus that can cause lethal disease in both humans and ruminant animals . RVFV is classified by the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases ( NIAID ) as a category A priority pathogen and is a United States Department of Agriculture ( USDA ) high priority pathogen . RVFV is historically endemic in sub-Saharan Africa , but recent outbreaks on the Arabian Peninsula have indicated an increased range for this virus . A recent outbreak in South Africa ( 2010\u2013May 2011 ) resulted in over 250 laboratory confirmed cases with an approximate case fatality rate of 11% [1] . RVFV is transmitted primarily by Aedes mcintoshi mosquitoes , although the virus has been detected in 23 species of mosquitoes [2] . Given the abundance of Aedes spp . in the United States and in other parts of the world , the potential introduction of RVFV into na\u00efve populations is a very serious agricultural and public health concern [3] , [4] . Effective vaccines or therapeutic intervention are not commercially available for prevention or treatment of Rift Valley fever ( RVF ) in humans . RVF outbreaks in human populations vary in size , intensity and location with these parameters dependent upon rainfall and mosquito abundance [5]\u2013[7] . The largest recorded outbreak of RVF was in Egypt in 1977 with 10 , 000 to 20 , 000 human cases [8] , [9] . Patients present with general malaise ( chills , headaches , joint pain and nausea ) and fever that is debilitating for a short period . A small percentage ( \u22641% ) of patients present with severe manifestations including encephalitis , retinal vasculitis , or hemorrhagic fever . Mortality rates up to 20% have been reported in these cases [9]\u2013[12] . RVFV causes a much more catastrophic disease in ruminants than is seen in humans , particularly in pregnant animals where nearly 100% of RVFV infected ruminants abort their fetuses [13] , [14] . The onset of human cases can often be predicted by outbreaks of disease in animals [7] , [15] . Although there are currently no licensed vaccines or therapeutics for RVFV infection in humans , several potential vaccines are available and have been tested in animals and humans ( www . clinicaltrials . gov ) [16]\u2013[22] . One of the most promising is the live-attenuated MP-12 vaccine [18] which was developed by the US Army [23] . The MP-12 strain was developed by 12 serial passages of the wild-type strain ZH548 in the presence of 5-fluorouracil to generate a virus that was avirulent in pregnant ewes [22] , [23] . Further analysis of MP-12 found that it induced high titer neutralizing antibodies in vaccinated ewes and protected vaccinated lambs from subsequent challenge with wild-type virus [24] . MP-12 has subsequently been found to be apathogenic in adult mice [25] . The MP-12 vaccine is available to researchers through the Special Immunizations Program at the US Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases ( USAMRIID ) as part of an on-going clinical trial ( www . clinicaltrials . gov ) . RVFV is a lipid-enveloped icosohedral virus [26]\u2013[28] containing a segmented , negative-sense , single-stranded RNA genome [29] . The genome consists of three segments: large ( L ) , medium ( M ) , and small ( S ) . The L segment encodes the viral polymerase , while the M segment encodes 4 proteins: Gn and Gc , ( surface glycoproteins ) , NSm ( non-structural protein ) and a 78 kDa protein . The S segment is ambisense and encodes for two proteins: N ( nucleocapsid ) and NSs ( non-structural protein ) [29] . The NSs protein of wild-type virus has been shown to have type I interferon ( IFN ) antagonist activity while this property is lacking in the NSs protein of the RVFV mutant clone 13 which has an in-frame deletion in the NSs gene [30] , [31] . Other than the potential role of type I IFN in limiting disease [32]\u2013[34] , little else is known about the host immune response to RVFV infection . One study by Smith et al . examined pathogenesis in BALB/c mice following wild-type virus challenge , focusing on viral titers in tissues , types of infected cells and histopathological changes during infection [35] . An additional recent study evaluated the gene expression of IL-10 , IFN-\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b3 over the course of wild-type virus infection in juvenile BALB/c mice while utilizing gene array to identify the significant upregulation of a number of immune response genes in the liver of infected mice [33] . The study described here was developed with the intent of characterizing the relationship between the host response and viral pathogenicity in adult C57BL/6 mice following challenge with either wild-type RVFV ZH501 or the attenuated vaccine strain MP-12 . Here we evaluated a large panel of cytokines and chemokines in multiple tissues over the complete course of the infection in addition to measuring a number of clinical parameters . The ZH501 strain of RVFV was isolated during the same 1977 outbreak in Kenya as was ZH548 and a sequence comparison indicates approximately 99% identity . We chose to use C57BL/6 mice for this study as this strain is biased toward a Th-1 , or cell-mediated , immune response , which is more typical in limiting viral infection [36]\u2013[42] . Our studies found a marked difference between the host response to infection with wild-type RVFV and the attenuated MP-12 vaccine strain . While neither virus caused overt changes in body weight or temperature , changes in clinical parameters were more profound in animals infected with wild-type virus than with the vaccine strain . Histopathologic changes in animals infected with the wild-type virus were more significant than those in mock or MP-12 infected animals , including hepatocellular necrosis , which correlated with the presence of viral antigen . Furthermore , there was a significant cytokine response in wild-type virus infected animals in all organs examined; whereas the only changes seen in MP-12 infected animals were , surprisingly , in the brain . An increased cytokine response could also be correlated with histological changes seen in the organs of ZH501 infected animals versus those infected with MP-12 . These studies reinforce the notion that the pathogenicity seen in RVFV infections in mice is driven primarily by an unregulated host inflammatory response which results in significant loss of liver function and development of neurologic disease . \n This animal study was conducted in accordance with an animal use protocol approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee ( IACUC ) ( Protocol #0505029 ) at the University of Texas Medical Branch ( UTMB ) following recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health . This institution also accepts as mandatory the PHS policy on Humane Care of Vertebrate Animals used in testing , research and training . All work was performed at UTMB in a facility accredited by the American Association for the Accreditation of laboratory Animal Care . RVFV wild-type strain ZH501 and vaccine strain MP-12 were obtained from Dr . John Morrill ( UTMB ) . The virus stocks used for the assays described here were p2 ( MP-12 ) and p1 ( ZH501 ) from the stocks received from Dr . Morrill . Both viruses were cultured and titrated on Vero E6 cells ( ATCC # CRL-1586 ) . For virus challenge of mice , virus was diluted in serum-free DMEM prior to inoculation . Adult ( 8\u201310 week old ) , female C57BL/6 mice ( Harlan Sprague Dawley ) were inoculated subcutaneously with 1 , 000 plaque forming units ( PFU ) of ZH501 , MP-12 or an equivalent volume of diluent . The LD50 for ZH501 is \u223c1 PFU . Each challenge group consisted of 5 animals . Three challenge groups ( one group each: ZH501 , MP-12 and mock infected ) were terminally bled and euthanized every 12 hours post-infection ( hpi ) . Mice from groups designated for sacrifice on the last day of the experiment had their weight and body temperature measured daily throughout the course of the experiment by BioMedic Data Solutions ( Seaford , DE ) transponders implanted two days prior to challenge . All work involving handling of infectious RVFV ZH501 , was performed in the Robert E . Shope BSL-4 laboratory at UTMB . At sacrifice , whole blood was collected for hematology and clinical chemistry and serum was isolated for analysis of the cytokine response profile and for virus titration . Approximately half of each organ we examined ( liver , spleen and brain ) was harvested and homogenized in 0 . 5 ml PBS using a Qiagen TissueLyser ( Qiagen ) to be used for virus titration and cytokine profile analysis . All samples removed from BSL-4 laboratory were \u03b3-irradiated ( 5 Mrad ) prior to analysis . Vero E6 cells were infected with 100 \u00b5l of sample through 10-fold serial dilutions . Plates were incubated for 1 hour in a 37\u00b0C incubator with 5% CO2 and gentle rocking every 15 minutes . A 0 . 8% tragacanth ( f/c ) /1\u00d7 MEM overlay was applied to the wells . After 3 days , the overlay was removed and the cells were stained with 0 . 2% crystal violet diluted in 10% formalin . The plaques were counted and the titers determined . Viral titers are reported as log10 PFU . Tissue homogenates and serum were processed according to manufacturer instructions and then analyzed using a Bio-plex 200 system ( Bio-Rad , Hercules , CA ) . Briefly , the samples were centrifuged for 10 minutes at 1 , 000 rpm at 4\u00b0C to remove debris . The supernatants were collected and aliquoted into 96-well plates in pre-determined wells; this plate was centrifuged at 1 , 250 rpm to remove any remaining debris . The supernatant was transferred to a 96-well flat bottom plate and processed for use on the Bio-plex system . The cytokines were coupled to cytokine specific multi-plex beads ( Bio-Rad ) following the manufacturer's instructions using pre-designed assays that measured the concentration of a panel of cytokines including interleukin ( IL ) -1\u03b1/\u03b2 , IL-2 , IL-3 , IL-4 , IL-5 , IL-6 , IL-9 , IL-10 , IL-12 ( p40 , p70 ) , IL-13 , IL-17 , eotaxin , IFN\u03b3 , KC ( CXCL1 ) , monocyte chemoattractant protein ( MCP ) -1 ( CCL2 ) , granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ( G-CSF ) , granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) , macrophage inflammatory protein ( MIP ) 1\u03b1/\u03b2 ( CCL3/CCL4 ) , tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) -\u03b1 and RANTES ( CCL5 ) . Assays for IFN-\u03b2 were performed by ELISA following the manufacturer's instructions ( PBL Biomedical Laboratories , Piscataway , NJ ) . Samples were prepared similarly to the Bio-plex samples . They were centrifuged for 10 minutes at 1 , 000 rpm at 4\u00b0C to remove debris . The supernatant was transferred to ELISA strips processed for use on the plate reader . The IFN-\u03b2 in the sample adhered to the pre-coated wells during incubation . After washing , the plates were incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody , with a washing step between incubations . The strips were then incubated with a TMB solution for 15 minutes and 100 \u00b5l of stop solution was added . These strips were read at 450 nm within 5 minutes of addition of stop solution . Complete blood counts ( CBC ) were evaluated with a Hemavet hematology analyzer ( Drew Scientific , Dallas , TX ) . Analysis included total white ( WBC ) and red blood cell ( RBC ) counts , platelet counts , hemoglobin concentration , hematocrit , and the counts of white blood cell subpopulations ( lymphocytes , monocytes , eosinophils , neutrophils , and basophils ) . Clinical chemistry analysis was performed using a VetScan2 Chemistry Analyzer ( Abaxis , Union City , CA ) . Fourteen analytes were examined including the liver enzyme alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) , serum glucose , amylase , plasma electrolytes ( calcium , phosphorus , sodium , and potassium ) , globulin , albumin , total bilirubin , urea nitrogen , creatinine , and total protein . Formalin-fixed tissues were processed in a Sakura Tissue-Tek VIP Processor , and were mounted in paraffin blocks . The RVFV antigen immunostain was prepared using mouse on mouse polymer technology and the Sequenza cover plate system . The steps briefly were: 1 ) Antigen retrieved using DIVA solution in a steamer ( 20 min ) ; 2 ) Peroxide block using peroxidase ( 5 Min ) ; 3 ) Blocking step using Rodent Block M ( 30 min ) ; 4 ) RVFV mouse hyper-immune ascitic fluid ( World Reference Collection for Emerging Viruses and Arboviruses at UTMB ) , used at 1\u2236100 dilution ( 60 min ) ; 6 ) Secondary antibody using Biocare MM HRP Polymer ( 30 min ) ; 7 ) chromagen was DAB ( 5 min ) ; 8 ) Counterstained with hematoxylin for 5 minutes . As the test groups are small , a Fisher's exact test was used to determine the significance between ZH501 , MP-12 and mock infected groups in clinical and cytokine analyses . A Kaplan-Meier estimate weight and temperature analysis was applied to the 6 days post infection ( dpi ) group . \n As anticipated , mock and MP-12 infected mice showed no signs of clinical disease and all survived until sacrificed or the end of the experiment . ZH501 infected mice began to show signs of illness ( i . e . ruffled fur and hunched posture ) by 36 hpi . All ZH501 infected mice developed signs of clinical illness and succumbed to disease . Of the subset of ZH501 infected animals monitored daily for weight and body temperature , 85% were alive on day 2 , 30% survived to day 3 , and all were dead at day 4 ( Figure 1 ) . All animals in the monitored MP-12 and mock-infected groups survived through completion of the study . During the course of the experiment , none of the mice lost a significant amount of weight or became febrile ( Figure 2 ) . CBCs are an important diagnostic and prognostic tool for determining overall human clinical health and are a reliable measure of multiple indices of whole blood components . We performed CBCs in this study to determine their utility in assessing the health of mice during RVFV infections . Whole blood from animals was collected by terminal cardiac puncture . Overall , no significant difference in the total white blood cell ( WBC ) count between mock and MP-12 infected mice was observed for any of the measured parameters ( Figure 3 , Table S1 ) . The CBC's of ZH501 infected animals were not remarkably different from MP-12 or mock infected animals until 60 hpi where drop in total WBC count was observed between 60 and 72 hpi , but rebounded at 84 and 96 hpi . The decrease in total white blood cells between 60 and 72 hpi was driven primarily by marked reduction in lymphocyte and monocyte numbers in the ZH501 infected animals . At 96 hpi the concentration of monocytes in ZH501 infected animals was elevated relative to both mock and MP-12 infected animals , but the difference was not significant . Eosinophils only showed a change at 96 hpi after ZH501 infection when the concentration of eosinophils was increased in ZH501 infected animals . The neutrophil population did not deviate significantly between the infection groups over the course of the experiment ( Table S1 ) . RBC populations were largely the same between all three challenge groups . However , at 24 hpi the RBC concentration in MP-12 infected animals was significantly higher than in mock or ZH501 infected mice while at 72 hpi , ZH501 infected animals had a decreased RBC count ( Figure 3 , Table S1 ) . Interestingly , the platelet count was within normal ranges ( 592\u20132 , 972 K/ul ) for all groups until 72 hpi where the platelet concentration in ZH501 infected mice dropped well below normal . There was a slight recovery at 84 hpi , but then the level dropped to below normal again at 96 hpi . RVFV is known to be hepatotropic [43] and infection can stimulate release of liver specific enzymes from disrupted hepatocytes and serve as clinical markers of hepatic dysfunction . In this study serum liver enzyme concentrations became elevated in ZH501 infected mice as the disease progressed . Alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) began to increase at 36 hpi and peaked in concentration at 60 hpi in ZH501 infected animals ( Figure 4C ) . While normal values of ALT in the mouse are 17\u201377 U/L , one mouse infected with ZH501 had ALT serum levels over 500 U/L at 36 hpi , one animal had levels of 1 , 300 U/L at 48 hpi , and two mice had over 1 , 500 U/L of ALT in their serum at 60 hpi . No animals in the mock or MP-12 infected groups had ALT concentrations above 150 U/L ( Figure 4A\u2013B ) . Serum glucose levels dropped drastically in ZH501 infected mice at 72 hpi ( Figure 4C ) , began to increase at 84 hpi , and were above normal at 96 hpi . Total bilirubin was also elevated in ZH501 infected animals ( Figure 4C ) . At 72 and 84 hpi one mouse in each ZH501 infected group had elevated total bilirubin concentrations . Analyzed plasma electrolytes ( calcium , phosphorous , sodium , and potassium ) did not show a significant deviation from normal concentrations ( data not shown ) . To correlate the onset of illness with virus replication in different organs , we harvested tissues from groups of 5 mice every 12 hours and determined virus titers by plaque assay . MP-12 infected animals did not have any detectable virus in any tissue until they became viremic at 72 hpi with a peak titer of 2 . 5 log10 PFU/ml . The viremia was below detectable limits ( \u223c200 PFU ) by 84 hpi in our assay . In the liver , virus appeared at 96 hpi when the viral load was just under 4 log10 PFU/ml with a slight decrease in tissue titer at 108 hpi and was no longer detectable at 120 hpi . MP-12 was not detected in the spleens or brains of infected mice at any point during the study ( Figure 5A ) . ZH501 appeared at 24 hpi in the serum and peaked at 84 hpi with over 7 log10 PFU/ml in the liver ( Figure 5B ) . In the spleen the peak viral titer was seen at 48 hpi where over 6 log10 PFU/ml of virus was present . While there was a fall in the spleen titers at 72 hpi , the viral titers in the serum , liver , and brain remained elevated . ZH501 titers peaked at 60 hpi in the brain and serum at 5 log10 PFU/ml and 6 log10 PFU/ml , respectively . Virus titers declined to levels undetectable by plaque assay in the serum , liver and brain in the three remaining animals sacrificed at 96 hpi ( Figure 5B ) . Immunohistochemical stains for RVFV antigen in formalin-fixed tissues collected from the three study groups were examined microscopically ( Figures 5C\u2013F ) . RVFV antigen was not found in the tissues of 10 mock-infected animals analyzed over the course of the study . Seven of 11 MP-12 infected mice had no viral antigen in any of the tissues examined while three mice , one each at 48 , 72 , and 96 hpi , had occasional antigen-positive cells in splenic red pulp sinusoids and white pulp lymphoid follicles . One MP-12 infected animal at 96 hpi exhibited cytoplasmic antigen staining within multiple hepatic microgranulomas . Seven of eight ZH501 infected mice sacrificed from 48 to 84 hpi exhibited diffuse granular cytoplasmic viral antigen staining in most hepatocytes ( 75% to 95% of cells affected ) ( Figures 5C\u2013D ) . While two of eight ZH501 infected animals had no splenic viral antigen staining , up to 5% of the cells in splenic red pulp sinusoids and white pulp lymphoid follicles in the other six animals contained cytoplasmic viral antigen ( Figure 5E ) . Viral antigen was not detected in brain or spinal cord sections in any mouse from any infection group ( Figure 5F ) . RVFV infection is known to cause a number of pathogenic effects that could be correlated with the host immune response to infection . In order to identify potential mechanisms of pathogenesis during RVFV infection , we examined the cytokine response and histological changes in three major organs ( spleen , liver , brain ) and serum . We chose these organs because they are principal components of the host immune response and have been associated with RVFV pathogenicity [43] , [44] . The results from these assays found that wild-type ZH501 causes a significant cytokine response in all of the organs examined compared to MP-12 . The responses for each organ are summarized below . Individual graphs for a representative subset of the cytokines examined are shown in Figures S1 , S2 , S3 , S4 . Examination of H&E stained sections from the liver , spleen and brain largely supported clinical and cytokine response observations indicating significant damage to the liver and spleen of ZH501 infected animals , while tissues from mock and MP-12 infected animals were essentially normal ( Figures 7 A , B , D , E ) . Histological evidence of hepatocellular degeneration and necrosis was seen as early as 48 hpi in ZH501 infected mice , and was present throughout the remaining course of the infection . These findings correlated well with the cytokine response in that ZH501 infected animals with the more significant cytokine response also had increased tissue damage . At 48 hpi , the mouse with the highest cytokine levels ( IL-1\u03b1 , IL-6 , IL-8 , IL-12 , IFN\u03b3 , eotaxin , and G-CSF ) also exhibited moderate diffuse hepatic necrosis . Liver changes in the mouse with lower cytokine levels at 48 hpi were much less severe and consisted of diffuse cytoplasmic vacuolation of hepatocytes and random small microgranulomas . At 60 hpi , the mouse with higher levels of IL-1\u03b1 , IL-6 , IL-8 , IFN\u03b3 , and various chemokines in the liver had moderate necrosis and hepatocyte degeneration , while other ZH501 infected animals had minimal microgranulomas composed of neutrophils , Kupffer cells , and lymphocytes that did not affect surrounding tissue . The foci of hepatocyte degeneration and necrosis contained occasional neutrophils , Kupffer cells and lymphocytes . At 72 hpi , the livers of ZH501 infected mice had evidence of severe architectural disruption and most of the hepatocytes were in the process of degeneration and necrosis . There was disassociation of hepatocytes from hepatic plates , expansion of sinusoidal lumens and accumulation of blood ( hemorrhage ) within dilated hepatic sinusoids . Most of the hepatocyte nuclei that remained intact contained a single , centrally-located , intranuclear eosinophilic inclusion that tended to peripheralize the nuclear chromatin . At 84 hpi , the livers looked similar to those collected at 72 hpi with marked architectural disruption and necrosis ( Figure 6C ) . The spleens of the mock and MP-12 infected mice remained essentially normal throughout the study ( Figures 7D , E ) . The only pathologic changes occurred in mice infected with ZH501 . From 48 hpi to 84 hpi , the spleens of ZH501 infected mice with the highest levels of cytokines ( IL-1\u03b1 , IL-1\u03b2 , IL-6 , eotaxin , MCP , and MIP-1\u03b1 ) also had corresponding splenic enlargement and moderate amounts of necrotic cellular debris diffusely within red pulp sinusoids . Similar splenic changes were not seen in animals with a limited cytokine response . At later time points ( i . e . 72 and 84 hpi ) , however , splenic pathology was more profound , consisting of increased neutrophilic and histiocytic infiltrates admixed with hemosiderin and necrotic cellular debris ( Figures 7F ) . The brains of all mice appeared essentially normal throughout the course of the study despite evidence of a high viral titer and significantly increased inflammatory cytokine concentrations in the brain tissue of some study animals . \n Rift Valley fever virus is a highly pathogenic virus that causes large scale outbreaks in livestock with frequently associated epidemics in humans . The mouse is an established model for RVFV infection where animals succumb to wild-type RVFV infection within a matter of days with disease characteristics similar to that seen in fatal cases of human disease and in infected newborn lambs [12] . While the mouse is an accepted model for disease , the host response to infection has not been well characterized . Some studies have evaluated clotting time , mortality , and disease progression , but few have focused in on the host immune response to RVFV infection [12] , [22] , [32]\u2013[35] , [51]\u2013[53] . Smith et al . recently described the pathogenesis of wild-type ZH501 infection in BALB/c mice following subcutaneous challenge [35] , but did not have the benefit of cytokine profiles to correlate pathogenesis to the host response while other studies focused on a limited number of cytokines [32]\u2013[34] . The study described here is the first broad examination of the host response to RVFV infection in the mouse model . This study identifies very significant differences between the host response to infection with wild-type ZH501 or the live-attenuated vaccine strain MP-12 and clearly demonstrates that a significant and systemic pro-inflammatory immune response is likely a major contributor to the progression to lethal disease . Unlike previous studies where we have evaluated the clinical response to viral infection in the mouse model [54] , clinical analysis of RVFV infection in the mouse provided indicators of disease onset and development that correlated with reports of RVFV infection in both humans and primates . In the present study , there was no statistical difference in body weight or temperature in any of the challenge groups despite the ZH501 infected animals showing clear indications of disease and individual animals in the dpi 3 and 4 ZH501 infected groups losing weight . However , hematological analysis made it clear that wild-type RVFV infection stimulates depletion of lymphocytes , monocytes and platelets over the course of disease . The depletion of total WBC was largely the result of lymphopenia during the mid-stages of disease in ZH501 infected animals . Our study found a decrease in both total WBC and lymphocytes between 48 and 60 hpi in ZH501 infected mice ( Table S1 ) with a gradual recovery toward the end of the study . Lymphocyte recovery may be the result of stimulation of the hematopoietic system as significantly increased concentrations of G-CSF were found in the serum and tissues of ZH501 infected animals . Hematology results in the C57BL/6 mouse model correlate well with previously published studies in BALB/c mice [35] and rhesus macaques [52] . Infected macaques had an initial leukocytosis and then a sharp decrease to leukopenia at 5 dpi that slowly resolved by 7 dpi . In another study evaluating WBC counts in ZH501 infected rhesus macaques , animals with a fatal outcome had evidence of leukocytosis at 2 dpi which remained elevated until death or returned to baseline levels just prior to death [53] . Animals which showed clinical illness but survived infection had only a transient leukocytosis . The decrease in platelet concentration in ZH501 infected mice was not surprising given the hemorrhagic nature of the disease . Morrill et al . reported a drop in platelet counts in RVFV infected macaques which was in direct proportion to the severity of the disease [53] . In our mouse studies there was no difference between MP-12 and mock infected animals , but there was a significant decrease in the mean platelet count in ZH501 infected animals relative to mock infected animals . Examination of individual ZH501 infected animals found that mice with liver damage indicated by elevated serum ALT , low glucose and high bilirubin also had low platelet counts . However , not all mice with low platelet counts had evidence of severe liver damage . These data indicate a correlation between liver disease and low platelet counts , but not the reverse , in mice infected with wild-type RVFV . Similar results have been seen in humans where approximately half of the patients with laboratory confirmed RVF present with abnormal platelet counts [55] . Clinical chemistry data provided a clear indication of liver disease in ZH501 infected animals , but no evidence of similar disease in MP-12 or mock infected animals . Liver necrosis has been shown to be a large contributor to the mortality seen after infection with wild-type RVFV [11] , [35] , [53] , [55]\u2013[57] . In studies with ZH501 infected non-human primates , serum aminotransferases were increased in animals with fatal infections [58] . The same study also showed a correlation between the amount of liver damage ( using ALT values ) and viremia [58] . ZH501 infected mice with elevated ALT and bilirubin concentrations had histological evidence of hepatitis , liver necrosis and possible hepatitis associated jaundice . In Saudi Arabia , 95% of patients with confirmed RVFV infections had increased ALT levels and 75% resulted in liver failure [55] . Animals with extremely elevated ( above 600 U/L ) serum ALT also had increased virus titers and a stronger cytokine response in the liver indicating a strong correlation with the onset of liver disease . At necropsy the livers were enlarged , appeared congested , and had areas of black discoloration . Microscopic examination revealed hepatic necrosis , loss of sinusoidal integrity , hemorrhage , and significant levels of viral antigen ( Figure 7C ) . To characterize the host immune response to RVFV infection and to differentiate infection with MP-12 vaccine strain from wild-type ZH501 , we determined the concentration of a panel of cytokines in tissue homogenates and serum . The response to ZH501 infection was significant and dramatic in all of the tissues tested while the response to MP-12 infection was largely unremarkable . The response seen in livers from ZH501 infected animals was unexpected . Given the nature of the wild-type RVFV infection , we expected evidence of a significant inflammatory response in the liver . The induction of a pro-inflammatory response was not evident; however , a significant chemokine response focused on recruitment of T-cells , neutrophils and monocytes was pronounced . Histological evaluation of livers from ZH501 infected mice identified significant cellular infiltration and congestion with the appearance of neutrophils , macrophages , and lymphocytes within disrupted sinusoids and eosinophilic intranuclear inclusions that are reported to be characteristic of RVFV infection [59] . Histological data correlated strongly with the observed chemokine response and were also consistent with studies in BALB/c mice [35] . Morphologically , the spleen was enlarged and the red pulp contained accumulations of cellular debris , neutrophils and macrophages containing hemosiderin ( Figure 7C ) . Hemosiderin is commonly found in macrophages when they break down hemoglobin and release heme and bilirubin after conditions that result in hemorrhage [60] , [61] . The presence of hemosiderin containing macrophages in the spleen is indicative of hemorrhage following ZH501 infection . The level of serum cytokines was significantly increased in ZH501 infected animals . The levels of IL-6 , IL-12 ( p40 ) , G-CSF and several chemokines were elevated indicating the onset of a strong inflammatory response and recruitment of immunomodulatory cells . The concentrations of all analytes , with the exception of IL-5 and IL-13 , were significantly elevated in serum at 72 hpi , supporting our hypothesis of a strong unregulated immune response following ZH501 infection . Interestingly , animals sampled at 84 hpi did not have this broad cytokine response and animals sampled at 96 hpi had normal cytokine levels . These data suggest that there might be a critical transition period for RVFV pathogenesis that occured around 72 hpi , although exactly what this transition entails or the associated mechanism is unclear . Despite a slight cytokine response in the brain following MP-12 infection , which could indicate initiation of cellular recruitment , correlating pathology was not seen . The results from MP-12 infected animals were in striking contrast to the response seen in ZH501 infected mice . A very significant pro-inflammatory cytokine response was stimulated in the brains of ZH501 infected mice and it was maintained through the course of disease . Despite the pronounced cytokine and chemokine response in the brain beginning around 48 hpi , we did not find viral antigen or histological evidence of meningoencephalitis as was observed in BALB/c mice [35] . It is surprising that we could not detect viral antigen in brain sections , as viral titers reached 5 logs in the brain when evaluated via plaque assay . Since animals were not perfused prior to tissue harvest , infectious virions could originate from residual blood in the brains . Smith et al . [35] did not detect meningoencephalitis until day 8 post infection while in our study none of the ZH501 infected animals survived beyond 4 dpi , in part by experimental design . Based on the Smith et al . study and observations during vaccine trials , it is likely that the C57BL/6 mice would have developed neurological disease had they survived longer . Previously published studies have shown that the NSs protein of wild-type RVFV has type I IFN antagonist properties [34] , while the MP-12 vaccine strain induces type I IFN in in-bred mouse strains [30] , [31] , [62] . Here we found that wild-type ZH501 induced a modest IFN-\u03b2 response in the liver and spleen while the IFN-\u03b2 response in MP-12 infected animals was negligible . The induction of the IFN-\u03b2 response was not evident until 72 hpi suggesting that production of measurable IFN-\u03b2 could be correlated to increases in virus titer and is similar to results reported by van Vuren in BALB/c mice [33] . Previous work has shown that the initial inhibition of type I IFN occurs shortly after infection allowing the virus to become established with the resulting release of IFN-\u03b2 coming from bystander cells [30] , [31] . These data are similar to results from Bouloy et al who found that acid stable IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 levels were negligible in the serum of wild-type ( 129/SvPasIco ) mice infected with either wild-type ZH548 virus or the MP-12 virus [31] . The lack of a strong generalized immune response suggests a key localized role for IFN-\u03b2 at the very onset of viral infection of macrophages or dendritic cells which could limit virus propagation and dissemination , subsequently eliminating the induction of a broad response . Evidence of virus in the spleen of some MP-12 infected animals and the moderate Th-2 type response in the brain suggests that some virus escapes initial control measures , but that the particle numbers are insufficient to trouble a competent immune system . In this study , we have clearly identified significant host response differences in the mouse model following infection with either wild-type RVFV or the attenuated vaccine strain . We have also identified a temporal correlation between increased virus titers in ZH501 infected mice , a decrease in lymphocytes , monocytes and platelets , architectural disruption and necrosis in the liver , and the onset of a significant systemic cytokine response . The specific mechanisms driving these physiological changes still need to be elucidated . However , many of the responses that we identified can be directly correlated to disease outcome . Clearly , there is a significant amount of cellular infiltration into and necrosis of the liver that likely limits organ function , disrupts regulation of the acute phase response and the ability of the coagulation cascade to limit hemorrhaging , regardless of the mechanism associated with vascular leakage . There is also evidence that neurologic disease may play a role in the demise of ZH501 infected animals despite a lack of gross signs of neurologic disease . The finding of neurologic involvement is not surprising as we have observed a number of studies with vaccines and attenuated viruses where animals that survive the first phase of disease following ZH501 infection and are only partially protected may succumb to neurologic disease 10\u201314 dpi ( M . Holbrook , unpublished observations ) . There have also been published reports of humans developing neurologic [63] and ocular disease [64] , [65] as a result of RVFV infection . This study has demonstrated that RVFV vaccine strain MP-12 infects and replicates in adult C57BL/6 mice , but does not cause acute disease , while the wild-type strain ZH501 is highly pathogenic and causes a significant innate immune response . Given that there are only 11 amino acid differences between the MP-12 strain and ZH548 , and the high homology between ZH501 and ZH548 , the differences in the host response are quite impressive . This study further validates the use of the mouse as a model for RVFV infection as clinical and immune response parameters can be correlated between the mouse and human disease . These studies also support the use of MP-12 as a safe and effective vaccine and on-going clinical trials will hopefully provide additional incentive for the use of MP-12 as a vaccine for RVFV .", "headings": ["Abstract", "Introduction", "Methods", "Results", "Discussion"], "keywords": ["medicine", "infectious diseases", "veterinary diseases", "biology", "microbiology", "veterinary science"], "id": "journal.pntd.0001529"}
{"lay_summary": "Breast cancers are divided into several different subtypes according to the expression of three receptors: estrogen receptor ( ER ) , progesterone receptor ( PR ) , and human epidermal receptor 2 ( HER2 ) . One subtype of breast cancer is known as triple-negative breast cancer ( TNBC ) because of lack of expression of all three receptors . TNBC is highly malignant and susceptible to developing drug resistance during chemotherapy . However , the reasons for resistance have not been well explained . We found that a secretory protein called C-C motif chemokine ligand 20 ( CCL20 ) responds to taxane chemotherapy in TNBC and promotes the expression of a drug efflux pump through a specific signaling pathway ( CCL20-protein kinase C\u03b6 [PKC\u03b6]/p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase [MAPK]-nuclear factor kappa B [NF-\u03baB]-ATP-binding cassette subfamily B member 1 [ABCB1] ) . Increasing levels of CCL20 result in expanding breast cancer stem-like cell population and chemotherapeutic resistance in breast cancer cells . Breast cancer stem-like cells are a special population of cells with self-renewal and differentiation potential within the tumor , which are often the culprit of tumor reoccurrence , drug resistance , and metastasis . Our results suggest that blocking CCL20 or its downstream signal can significantly improve the therapeutic efficacy of TNBC .", "article": "Chemotherapeutic resistance in triple-negative breast cancer ( TNBC ) has brought great challenges to the improvement of patient survival . The mechanisms of taxane chemoresistance in TNBC have not been well investigated . Our results illustrated C-C motif chemokine ligand 20 ( CCL20 ) was significantly elevated during taxane-containing chemotherapy in breast cancer patients with nonpathologic complete response . Furthermore , CCL20 promoted the self-renewal and maintenance of breast cancer stem cells ( BCSCs ) or breast cancer stem-like cells through protein kinase C\u03b6 ( PKC\u03b6 ) or p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) -mediated activation of p65 nuclear factor kappa B ( NF-\u03baB ) pathway , significantly increasing the frequency and taxane resistance of BCSCs . Moreover , CCL20-promoted NF-\u03baB activation increased ATP-binding cassette subfamily B member 1 ( ABCB1 ) /multidrug resistance 1 ( MDR1 ) expression , leading to the extracellular efflux of taxane . These results suggested that chemotherapy-induced CCL20 mediated chemoresistance via up-regulating ABCB1 . In addition , NF-\u03baB activation increased CCL20 expression , forming a positive feedback loop between NF-\u03baB and CCL20 pathways , which provides sustained impetus for chemoresistance in breast cancer cells . Our results suggest that CCL20 can be a novel predictive marker for taxane response , and the blockade of CCL20 or its downstream pathway might reverse the taxane resistance in breast cancer patients . \n Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers diagnosed among women , accounting for nearly 1 in 3 cancers [1] . The recurrence , metastasis , and drug resistance in the course of chemotherapy have brought great threat to breast cancer patients [2 , 3] , especially as chemoresistance limits the effectiveness of chemotherapeutic agents to a large extent . Although the triple-negative breast cancers ( TNBCs ) are generally very susceptible to chemotherapy initially because of the highly proliferative capacity , early complete response ( CR ) does not correlate with overall survival ( OS ) [4] . Chemoresistance emerges during therapy because tumor cells are able to maintain viability following chemotherapeutic exposure via undergoing alternative cellular fates such as autophagy , cellular senescence , and therapeutic induced senescence ( TIS ) , although cytotoxic chemotherapy aims to kill cancer cells through apoptosis [5] . There are several specific ways to regulate chemoresistance of TNBC . Regulation of ATP-binding cassette ( ABC ) transporters and \u03b2-tubulin III subunit , disorder in enzymes critical in DNA replication and repair , alterations in genes involved in apoptosis , and drug inactivation/detoxification and abnormal regulation of key signaling pathways such as aberrant activation of nuclear factor kappa B ( NF-\u03baB ) or AKT activity all participate in chemoresistance in TNBC [6] . These regulatory mechanisms can help tumor cells escape apoptosis induced by chemotherapeutic drugs to acquire the ability of chemoresistance in TNBCs . Besides , more and more studies showed that breast cancer stem cells ( BCSCs ) , which represent a distinct population that can be prospectively isolated from the total tumor cell population and have clonal long-term repopulation and self-renewal capacity , are responsible for chemotherapy resistance [7] . The differential and diverse regulation of BCSCs also influences the chemoresistance of TNBCs . In addition to intrinsic genetic changes in cells as described above , recent data suggest that chemoresistance can also result from cell-extrinsic factors such as growth factors and cytokines [8] . Both malignant and cancer-associated normal cells in the tumor niche affect the balance of cytokines that play pivotal roles in regulating tumor cell proliferation , survival , and chemoresistance [9\u201311] . Gilbert and Hemann\u2019s study in lymphoma model described an interleukin 6 ( IL-6 ) -triggered cytokine-chain response that can promote therapeutic resistance to genotoxic chemotherapy of lymphoma cells [10] . In addition to IL-6 , some other cytokines are also able to regulate tumor progression and chemotherapeutic resistance in an autocrine manner in multiple cancers [12] . Although both the extrinsic and intrinsic factors have revealed the possible clues to chemotherapeutic resistance in TNBC , there are still some critical questions to be answered in clinical practice . During the taxane ( taxol or docetaxel ) therapies for TNBC patients , the risk factors for determining drug resistance and the underlying mechanisms remain unknown . And there is a lack of effective markers to indicate the chemoresistance of TNBC . Through studies analyzing breast cancer patients\u2019 serum , tumor tissue sample , survival prognosis , and pathologic response to taxane , we identified a chemokine , C-C motif chemokine ligand 20 ( CCL20 ) , that might predict the risk of taxane resistance in TNBC patients . Moreover , our studies in both TNBC cell line\u2013derived xenograft ( CDX ) and patient-derived xenograft ( PDX ) mouse models showed that the blockade to CCL20 or CCL20-mediated downstream molecules could attenuate BCSCs and reverse chemoresistance and significantly improved the chemotherapeutic efficacy of taxane to TNBC . CCL20 , a member of the C-C motif chemokine subfamily , participates in many diseases\u2019 progression\u2014including rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) , psoriasis , and immune response\u2014and promotes the malignancy in colorectal cancer and lung cancer [13 , 14] . However , the role of CCL20 in cancers has not been well elucidated . More importantly , little work has been done on the role of CCL20 in regulating the tumor progression and chemoresistance in breast cancer , especially TNBC , and the regulation mechanisms still remain unknown . Our current studies showed that taxane-induced CCL20 could promote self-renewal of BCSCs through the activation of p65 NF-\u03baB , which was mediated by protein kinase C\u03b6 ( PKC\u03b6 ) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) activity . The activation of p65 NF-\u03baB further promoted transcription of both ATP-binding cassette subfamily B member 1 ( ABCB1 ) and CCL20 , which sequentially increased extracellular efflux of taxane and enhanced CCL20 effect via a positive feedback loop , leading to the taxane-resistance of TNBCs and promoting breast cancer progression with worse prognosis . \n Taxanes have become widely recognized as active chemotherapeutic agents in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer and early-stage breast cancer [15] . Cytokine changes during chemotherapy regulate disease progression , favoring the growth and proliferation of tumor cells [16] . However , the involvement of taxane-induced cytokines in chemoresistant breast cancer has not been well studied . Here , we investigated cytokine levels in sera from 3 TNBC patients undergoing taxane-containing NAC . Utilizing cytokine arrays , we found that NAC significantly induced a serial of cytokines in the sera of patients , including CCL20 ( Fig 1A ) . In order to investigate whether CCL20 is one of the commonly taxane-induced cytokines , more serum samples were collected from breast cancer patients in clinic before , during , or after chemotherapy in the presence of taxol or docetaxel in the neoadjuvant setting , and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) was conducted to measure CCL20 levels in sera . The results showed that there is no significant difference among 3 collection time points in the entire cohort of patients ( Fig 1B ) . The patients were classified according to pCR or non-pCR . In pCR patients , there was no significant difference in the level of CCL20 at the 3 collection time points ( Fig 1C ) . However , in non-pCR patients , CCL20 was obviously increased in the sera collected during the chemotherapy compared with that collected before NAC . CCL20 was also augmented in sera after chemotherapy compared with that collected before NAC in non-pCR patients; however , the difference was not significant , probably because of the interval time between therapy termination and blood collection ( Fig 1D ) . These results suggest that there might be a correlation between CCL20 induction and taxane resistance . In order to verify our conjecture , we collected 36 pairs of breast tumor tissues before and after taxane-containing NAC from the same non-pCR patients in the clinical pathology from 4 cancer hospitals in China , and results showed that CCL20 staining was significantly increased in the tumor specimens from postchemotherapy , which represent the chemoresistant tumors ( Fig 1E and 1F ) . It is critical to investigate the effect of taxane on inducing cytokines from resistant cancer cells to clarify the relationship between chemotherapy-induced cytokines and taxane resistance . Cytokine antibody array was conducted in MDA-MB-231 cells ( Fig 1G and 1H ) . CCL20 level was obviously elevated after taxane treatment . Similar results were also validated in human TNBC cell lines SUM149 and SUM159 and mouse TNBC cell line 4T1 ( S1A , S1B , S1C and S1D Fig; Fig 1I and 1J ) . Then , we analyzed the induced cytokines from the 4 TNBC cell lines and the serum of patients with taxane chemotherapy . Interestingly , we found that CCL20 was the most universally and significantly up-regulated in common ( Fig 1K; S1E Fig ) , suggesting CCL20 might play a vital role in regulating the taxane resistance of breast cancer cells . Taken together , we identified a taxane-induced cytokine CCL20 , and its expression level in serum and tumor tissue showed a positive correlation with the poor pathologic response to NAC in breast cancer patients . Next , we established xenografts with mouse breast cancer cell line 4T1 in BALB/c mice and conducted the taxane treatment in mice to mimic the clinical setting . In comparison to the tumor-free mice ( \u201cNULL\u201d ) , only a few cytokines were elevated in the sera of mice bearing tumors but without treatments ( \u201cCTRL\u201d ) . However , consistent with results from breast cancer patient serum , cytokine levels in the mouse sera were significantly changed when receiving the taxane treatment , among which CCL20 was obviously observed ( Fig 2A ) . These results further suggested that the CCL20 was significantly induced in tumor-bearing mice under taxane treatment . Furthermore , we investigated whether the CCL20 induction depended on the taxane dosage or treatment duration . Utilizing 3 TNBC cell lines ( SUM149 , SUM159 , and MDA-MB-231 ) , we showed that CCL20 was induced by docetaxel in a dose-dependent way as measured by both quantitative real-time PCR ( qRT-PCR ) and ELISA ( Fig 2B and 2C ) . Also , docetaxel treatment triggered CCL20 induction significantly , and the induction efficacy progressed in a time-dependent manner ( S2A and S2B Fig; Fig 2D ) . In addition , we found that CCL20 was elevated in the tumor residue of MDA-MB-231 xenograft tumor model in the docetaxel treatment group , in contrast to the control group , as analyzed by immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) staining ( Fig 2E and 2F ) . In brief , these results suggested that CCL20 was indeed significantly increased after taxane treatment both in vitro and in vivo . To determine if CCL20 regulates breast cancer malignancy , firstly , we analyzed the database of The Cancer Genome Atlas ( TCGA , https://cancergenome . nih . gov/ ) and found that CCL20 was highly expressed in TNBC in contrast to non-TNBC ( Fig 3A ) , which was also observed at both mRNA and protein levels in breast cancer cell lines ( Fig 3B and 3C ) . These studies indicate CCL20 expression is positively correlated with the malignancy of breast cancer . In order to investigate the function of CCL20 in TNBC , we silenced CCL20 in TNBC cell lines and found knockdown of CCL20 significantly decreased the proliferation of cancer cells ( S3A and S3B Fig; Fig 3D ) . Cell invasion through basement membrane protein ( Matrigel ) ( Fig 3E and 3F ) and anchorage-independent growth ( Fig 3G ) were also reduced in CCL20 knockdown MDA-MB-231 cells . Moreover , we established CCL20-overexpressing cell lines with 2 different isoforms of CCL20 ( CCL20v1 and CCL20v2 ) , which well simulates the physiological level of CCL20 induced by docetaxel ( S3C , S3D , S3E and S3F Fig ) , and it was shown that CCL20 overexpression increased cell proliferation ( Fig 3H; S3G Fig ) , the invasion ability ( Fig 3I and 3J; S3H and S3I Fig ) , and the anchorage-independent growth ( Fig 3K; S3J and S3K Fig ) significantly in both MDA-MB-231 and SUM159 cells . In addition , recombinant human CCL20 ( rhCCL20 ) and CCL20 neutralization antibody ( anti-CCL20 ) were utilized to mimic the function-loss or function-gain assay above , and it was shown that cell proliferation and invasion were increased by rhCCL20 and decreased by anti-CCL20 in MDA-MB-231 and SUM159 cells ( Fig 3L and 3M; S3L and S3M Fig ) , which further confirmed the role of CCL20 in regulating TNBC cell malignancy . Our results in vivo also showed that CCL20 significantly accelerated tumor growth of MDA-MB-231 xenograft in nude mice ( Fig 3N and 3O ) . CCL20 can be induced by taxane and promoted the development of breast cancer , which , considering the relationship between CCL20 and pCR ( Fig 1D ) , prompted us to further observe impact of CCL20 on chemotherapy resistance . Our results showed that CCL20 overexpression promoted resistance to docetaxel in TNBC cell lines ( Fig 3P and 3Q ) . In conclusion , CCL20 significantly promoted the progression of TNBC both in vitro and in vivo , and it was preliminarily shown that CCL20 could promote the resistance of cancer cells to taxane . Others and we have shown that BCSCs are enriched after chemotherapy treatment [17] ( S4A Fig ) , which indicates taxane-resistant BCSCs limit the efficacy of taxane therapy . To explore the regulation of BCSCs via CCL20 , we first investigated the differential expression of CCL20 in BCSCs defined by ALDH activity and found there was higher level of CCL20 in flow-sorted ALDH+ population than in ALDH\u2212 population in TNBC ( Fig 4A ) . Moreover , the receptor of CCL20 , C-C motif chemokine receptor type 6 ( CCR6 ) , was also up-regulated in ALDH+ BCSCs of SUM149 , MDA-MB-231 , and PDX ( S4B and S4C Fig ) . These indicate the probable role of CCL20 in promoting BCSC stemness property . Hence , the stemness and self-renewal of BCSCs were determined after CCL20 overexpression . Stem cell genes NANOG , OCT4 , and SOX2 were up-regulated in CCL20-overexpressing cells ( Fig 4B; S4D Fig ) , which suggested that CCL20 promoted the stem property of BCSCs . Moreover , the tumorsphere formation was evidently increased in CCL20-overexpressing cells in comparison to the control cells ( Fig 4C and 4D; S4E and S4F Fig ) , suggesting the increase of self-renewal of BCSCs . Furthermore , enhancement of BCSC properties mediated via CCL20 affected the ALDH+ population , as shown in that CCL20 overexpression evidently increased ALDH+ cells , leading to the population expansion of BCSCs ( Fig 4E and 4F ) , which was reversed by CCL20 silencing ( Fig 4G and 4H ) . The promotion of CCL20 on expansion of ALDH+ cells was also proved in the MDA-MB-231 xenograft model in vivo , and the results showed that the ALDH+ population in CCL20-overexpressing xenografts was increased by 1-fold ( Fig 4I and 4J ) . Next , we tested if the effect of CCL20 on regulating BCSC expansion leads to taxane resistance . Utilizing in vitro sphere-culture system to enrich BCSCs , we showed that both CCL20 overexpression and rhCCL20 treatment increased the docetaxel resistance of sphere-formed cells , while the anti-CCL20 blocked this effect ( Fig 4K and 4L ) . It is interesting that , after blocking CCL20 , the drug resistance of the taxol-resistant subline of MDA-MB-231 was reduced to some extent ( Fig 4M ) . Taken together , CCL20 drives the self-renewal and expansion of ALDH+ population to promote the properties of BCSCs , leading to the increased taxane resistance of breast cancer cells . CCL20 is the only ligand that activates CCR6 [18] . In thyroid cancer , CCL20/CCR6 promotes the invasion and migration of thyroid tumor cells via p65 NF-\u03baB signaling [19] . The intermediate mechanism of NF-\u03baB activation via CCL20 still remains unknown . As the sole receptor for CCL20 [18] , CCR6 belongs to the superfamily of G protein\u2013coupled receptor ( GPCR ) , which provides signal-coupling mechanisms to heptahelical cell surface receptors and is critically involved in the regulation of the MAPK pathway [20] . Moreover , GPCR-coupled G protein can act as an adaptor protein to activate PKC\u03b6 in NIH 3T3-m1R cells [21] . Here in our study , after overexpression of CCL20 , an increase in p65 NF-\u03baB activation by phosphorylation was observed in breast cancer cells . The activation of p38 MAPK and PKC\u03b6 via phosphorylation was also increased by CCL20 overexpression in breast cancer cells ( Fig 5A ) . These results prompted us to demonstrate the probable mechanisms of CCL20 signal transduction in regulating the chemoresistance of BCSCs . As the downstream role of p65 NF-\u03baB in transducing signal , whether p65 activation was mediated by activity of p38 MAPK and PKC\u03b6 was explored . We found that the pharmacological inhibition of p65 NF-\u03baB activation via the specific inhibitor caffeic acid phenethyl ester ( CAPE ) did not affect the increased activity of p38 MAPK or PKC\u03b6 caused by CCL20 overexpression ( Fig 5B , S5A Fig ) , which suggested that p65 probably was the downstream effector of p38 MAPK or PKC\u03b6 when transducing CCL20 stimuli . But phosphorylation of p65 was not substantially decreased by inhibition of either PKC\u03b6 alone ( Gene Ontology [Go] 6983 ) or p38 MAPK alone ( SB202190 ) ( Fig 5C , S5B Fig ) . In addition , it was noticed that PKC\u03b6 inhibition actually increased the activation of p38 MAPK in CCL20-overexpressing cells , which was not observed in vector cells ( Fig 5D ) , partly accounting for the reason why effect of PKC\u03b6 inhibition alone on p65 activation was limited . Interestingly , the inhibition of both PKC\u03b6 and p38 MAPK significantly abolished the enhancement of p65 NF-\u03baB activity induced by CCL20 ( Fig 5E , S5C Fig ) . These results suggested that p38 or PKC\u03b6 mediated p65 NF-\u03baB activation in parallel manner under CCL20 overexpression ( Fig 5F ) . CCL20 activated p38 MAPK or PKC\u03b6 , followed by a dramatic increase of the phosphorylated p65 NF-\u03baB translocating into the nucleus , which indicates the activation of NF-\u03baB pathway ( Fig 5G ) . Whether p65 NF-\u03baB activation mediates the CCL20-induced chemoresistance was determined , and we found that the enhancement of CCL20 on docetaxel resistance was abolished by CAPE in the BCSC-enriched mammosphere-derived cells from both MDA-MB-231 ( Fig 5H ) and SUM159 ( Fig 5I ) . The docetaxel resistance enhanced by rhCCL20 in the BCSC-enriched mammosphere-derived cells from both MDA-MB-231 ( Fig 5J ) and SUM159 ( Fig 5K ) was also abolished by CAPE . In addition , the degree of PKC\u03b6 or p38 blockage alone was limited for the remission of resistance , and the combinatorial inhibition of the two significantly reduced chemoresistance induced by CCL20 ( S5D and S5E Fig ) . This further indicates that PKC\u03b6 and p38 mediate CCL20-induced drug resistance in a parallel manner , consistent with their impacts on the activation of p65 NF-\u03baB ( Fig 5E ) . To further confirm these findings , p65 was knocked down in CCL20v1-overexpressing breast cancer cells ( Fig 5L ) , and we found that docetaxel resistance of CCL20v1-overexpressing cancer cells was also abolished by p65 knockdown ( Fig 5M ) . Furthermore , we also noticed that the tumorsphere-forming ability of CCL20v1-overexpressing breast cancer cells was inhibited by p65 silencing ( Fig 5N and 5O ) . In addition , the p65 silence alone significantly reduced the chemoresistance and tumorsphere formation of BCSCs , further confirming the role of NF-\u03baB in this process ( S5F , S5G , S5H , S5I , S5J and S5K Fig ) . And the CCL20-dependent increase in the percentage of ALDH+ cells is mediated through p65 NF-\u03baB ( S5L Fig ) . These studies suggested that the activation of p65 NF-\u03baB pathway induced by CCL20 was mediated by p38 MAPK and PKC\u03b6 activity , respectively , and p65 NF-\u03baB activation plays an important role in mediating CCL20-promoted taxane resistance of BCSCs . Differential and diverse transcription control via NF-\u03baB appears to be context-dependent and stimulus-specific regulation of gene expression [22 , 23] . Alteration of transcriptional events after CCL20-induced p65 NF-\u03baB activation has not been studied yet . RNA sequencing ( RNA-seq ) was used to observe the transcriptome change by overexpression of CCL20 in TNBCs . Our results showed that the expression levels of the 32 genes were up-regulated by 1 . 5-fold or more , and 18 genes were down-regulated by 40% or more with CCL20 overexpression both in SUM159 and MDA-MB-231 cells ( Fig 6A ) , including ABCB1 . Up-regulation of ABCB1 transcription after CCL20 overexpression was validated by qRT-PCR ( Fig 6B ) and western blot ( Fig 6C ) . Similar to CCL20 expression pattern ( Fig 4A ) , ABCB1 was highly expressed in ALDH+ cells , compared with ALDH\u2212 cells ( S6A and S6B Fig ) . In addition , the CCL20-induced up-regulation of ABCB1 can be abrogated by p65 silencing , suggesting that p65 NF-\u03baB mediated the increased transcription of ABCB1 ( Fig 6D ) . ABCB1 , a member of the superfamily of ABC transporters , is an active efflux pump for a variety of toxins as well as dietary and environmental carcinogens and drugs [24] . More interestingly , the Gene Set Enrichment Analysis ( GSEA ) showed that the pathway termed response to chemical stimulus , which ABCB1 was in , was positively correlated with CCL20 overexpression significantly , indicating CCL20 enriches the gene sets with resistant ability for cancer cells to respond to chemical drugs ( Fig 6E ) . Therefore , we observed the pharmacological distribution and abundance of docetaxel in breast cancer cells after overexpression of CCL20 by high-performance liquid chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry ( HPLC-MS ) ( S6C Fig ) . Our results showed that , in comparison to vector cells , the intracellular drug abundance in CCL20-overexpressing cancer cells was decreased by 50% , and more docetaxel was accumulated in the extracellular supernatant ( Fig 6F ) . In view of the ability of ABCB1 to transport taxane as efflux pump [25 , 26] , the up-regulation of ABCB1 induced by CCL20 in our current studies might account for the pharmacological intracellular abundance of taxane being lower in CCL20-overexpressing cells than vector cells , which promoted the taxane resistance of breast cancer cells . In addition , the silence of ABCB1 also reversed the CCL20-induced resistance to chemotherapy ( S6D Fig ) . Together , these studies demonstrated that taxane-induced CCL20 activated NF-\u03baB through PKC\u03b6 or p38 and then promoted the expression of ABCB1 , leading to the chemoresistance of breast cancer cells . In addition , we were excited to observe that the increase of CCL20 induced by taxane depended on p65 NF-\u03baB activity ( Fig 6G ) , suggesting that the activated p65 NF-\u03baB could regulate CCL20 level in positive feedback to further enhance the effect of CCL20 on chemoresistance . Reduction in PKC\u03b6 and p38 activation after NF-\u03baB inhibition also further confirmed the existence of the CCL20-triggered feedback loop under docetaxel-treatment circumstances ( S6E and S6F Fig ) . The whole regulation loop for CCL20 and BCSC chemoresistance can be demonstrated as in Fig 6H . Our current studies are the first , to our knowledge , to demonstrate the mutual regulation between CCL20 and NF-\u03baB that up-regulates efflux pump protein ABCB1 to promote chemoresistance in BCSCs . Through analyzing the cohort of basal breast cancer cases , we found that high CCL20 expression significantly predicted poor OS in the entire cohort of breast cancer patients ( not only for patients treated by taxane ) ( Fig 7A ) , which , given the key role of CCL20 in modulating chemotherapeutic resistance , may provide an important clue for the design of subsequent new chemotherapy regimens for patients who have received chemotherapy but failed the treatment or are about to receive chemotherapy . Moreover , we found that the higher the histological grade , the more obvious the effect of CCL20 on the deterioration of OS . More interestingly , in the cohort of human epidermal receptor 2 ( HER2 ) -negative breast cancer cases including TNBC or non-TNBC , after neoadjuvant taxane-containing chemotherapy , the patients with high CCL20 level were in a poor condition of relapse-free survival ( RFS ) , and the higher the grade , the poorer the 5-year RFS in breast cancer patients with high CCL20 expression after NAC containing taxane ( Fig 7B ) , which revealed that CCL20 played a vital role in influencing patient survival after taxane treatment not only in TNBC but also probably in non-TNBC . Our results have shown that high CCL20 level contributed to taxane resistance . The residual taxane-resistant BCSC-enriched cells after chemotherapy tended to reproliferate and lead to tumor relapse , decreasing patient probability in RFS . CCL20 intervention may improve taxane therapy for breast cancer , including TNBCs . Our results in vivo suggested that CCL20 silencing could significantly improve the therapeutic effect of docetaxel and inhibit tumor growth in MDA-MB-231 tumor model ( Fig 7C and 7D ) . Moreover , the enrichment of ALDH+ BCSCs and CD24\u2212CD44+ BCSCs induced by docetaxel treatment in tumors can be reversed by CCL20 knockdown ( Fig 7E and S7A Fig ) . Since we have shown that p65 NF-\u03baB mediated the effects of CCL20 , therefore , we also investigated the effect of blocking p65 NF-\u03baB activation on the tumor growth . In the PDX model ( TNBC ) , the inhibition of p65 NF-\u03baB could enhance the antitumor effect of docetaxel significantly ( Fig 7F and 7G ) . Moreover , the phenomenon of BCSC enrichment induced by docetaxel treatment was also inhibited by CAPE ( Fig 7H and S7B Fig ) . In conclusion , high expression of CCL20 predicts worse prognosis in breast cancer patients . The combinational therapies of taxane and the blockade of CCL20 or its downstream signaling molecules can improve therapeutic effect of TNBC through attenuating BCSCs . \n TNBC has become a worldwide threat because of its high invasiveness , recurrence , drug resistance , and lack of effective treatment prescription [27] . Taxanes are the commonly used chemotherapeutic agents for TNBC [28] . The chemotherapeutic resistance during taxane treatment seriously affected the OS of cancer patients and brought huge complications to the clinician . Thus , it is urgent to demonstrate the mechanisms such as defining the key molecules in mediating taxane resistance in treating TNBCs . In response to the influence of repression and stimuli from chemotherapeutic agents , cancer cells will undergo multiple changes , such as alteration of the cytokine secretion . Through cytokine antibody array , we observed the correlation between CCL20 in patient serum and the indication of therapeutic response . In our studies , CCL20 emerged as the most responsive cytokine to taxane treatment , which is dosage dependent and time dependent . However , as far as the taxane stimulation on CCL20 is concerned , not only in TNBC but the phenomenon of CCL20 induction via taxane treatment also occurred in non-TNBC , actually , and the expression level of CCL20 in taxol-resistant sublines of colon cancer and ovarian cancer was significantly elevated ( S8 Fig ) . These suggest that CCL20 may confer taxane resistance in various molecule types of breast cancer and even across multiple cancers , in which further exploration and study are needed . Previous studies showed that CCL20 promoted proliferation and migration of normal breast epithelial cells [29 , 30] . Little work has revealed the regulation of CCL20 on breast cancer . Our studies showed that CCL20 stimulated the proliferation , invasion , and anchorage-independent growth in TNBC and promoted tumor outgrowth in vivo . In addition , we discovered CCL20 also exhibited strengthening in resistance to taxane , demonstrating its pivotal role in the regulation of breast cancer malignancy . And our results demonstrated for the first time that CCL20 promoted chemoresistance in BCSCs by enhancing self-renewal and stemness characteristics of BCSCs . The range of tumor types displaying aberrant NF-\u03baB activity is extensive and comprises many solid tumors , as well as lymphomas and leukemias [31 , 32] . NF-\u03baB signaling exhibits the intricate transcriptional control of gene expression and diverse posttranslational modifications in a stimulus-specific or context-dependent way , for which the influence on the tumor progression is also complex tumor promotion or suppression , chemoresistant or chemosensitive effect , and even playing the biphasic role with dynamic regulation in tumor progression [22 , 33] . In our results , p65 NF-\u03baB mediated CCL20-induced TNBC resistance to taxane . In this process , PKC\u03b6 and p38 delivered the CCL20 stimulus in parallel . We demonstrated that , under the stimulation of taxane-induced CCL20 , the p65 NF-\u03baB was mainly shown to promote resistance to apoptosis induced by taxane treatment . Combined with the inhibition of p65 NF-\u03baB activity , the therapeutic effect of docetaxel was significantly improved in vivo , which was consistent with the elevated therapeutic efficacy under the combinational treatment of docetaxel and direct CCL20 blockage in vivo . These discoveries shed light on direct targeting CCL20 or small molecule inhibition of CCL20-induced signaling being able to potentiate chemotherapeutic efficacy in breast cancer . In our study , one of the consequences following CCL20-induced p65 NF-\u03baB activation was the up-regulation of ABCB1 , which was involved in the efflux of a variety of drugs , including taxane [25 , 26] . The observation that the intracellular abundance of docetaxel was significantly decreased after overexpression of CCL20 in our study well demonstrated why CCL20-induced NF-\u03baB activation promoted taxane resistance . Our studies offer a novel strategy to solve taxane resistance in breast cancer , including TNBC\u2014that is , the combination of taxane treatment and the adjuvant pharmacological inhibition of ABCB1 may greatly improve the chemotherapeutic efficacy in breast cancer . In conclusion , our results demonstrated for the first time that CCL20 promoted chemoresistance in BCSCs through the positive feedback loop mediated by PKC\u03b6/p38-NF-\u03baB . Importantly , our findings suggest that CCL20 can be used as a novel chemoresistance marker for the adjuvant evaluation of therapeutic efficacy in taxane treatment and as a therapeutic target to improve the efficacy of taxane therapy for TNBC patients . \n Written informed consent was obtained from all patients before surgery , as advocated by the regional ethics committee .

All paraffin sections of tumors from breast cancer patients used in this study were provided by Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center , the First People's Hospital of Zhenjiang City , Southwest Hospital , and Qilu Hospital . And sera from patients were obtained from Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center . Breast cancer cell line SUM149 and SUM159 were from Asterland [34] . MDA-MB-231 and 4T1 were purchased from ATCC . The culture medium for SUM149 and SUM159 is Ham\u2019s F-12 ( Invitrogen ) supplemented with 5% FBS ( Gibco , United States of America ) , 5 \u03bcg/mL insulin , and 1 ug/mL hydrocortisone ( both from Sigma , St . Louis , USA ) and 1% pen-strep ( Beyotime , China ) . MDA-MB-231 and 4T1 cells were maintained in RPMI1640 medium ( Gibco , USA ) supplemented with 10% FBS ( Gibco , USA ) and 1% pen-strep antibiotic ( Beyotime , China ) . All of the cell lines were tested and authenticated . These cell lines were maintained at 37\u00b0C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 . All mice were bred and housed in AAALAC-accredited specific pathogen-free rodent facilities at University of Science and Technology of China . Mice were housed in sterilized , ventilated microisolator cages and supplied with autoclaved commercial chow and sterile water . Tumorigenicity was determined by injecting MDA-MB-231 cells and 4T1 cells with Matrigel into fourth mammary fat pads of 1-month-old female nude mice or BALB/c mice . The animals were euthanized when the tumors were 1 . 0\u20131 . 5 cm in diameter . Before being euthanized , a small quantity of blood was collected into a tube without additives from mouse eye socket . Then , it was kept at RT for 20 minutes , centrifuged 10 minutes at 3 , 000 rpm , aliquoted into small tubes , and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until use . A portion of each tumor was fixed in formalin and embedded in paraffin for histological analysis . Another portion was digested to single cell and utilized for flow cytometry . The tumor sizes were measured once a week with a caliper and calculated as tumor volume = Length \u00d7 Width2 / 2 . Mouse tumors were dissected and minced into small pieces and resuspended with collagenase-hyaluronidase digestion reagent ( Catalog #07912 , STEMCELL Technologies , USA ) . Tumor pieces were digested for approximately 1 hour at 37\u00b0C and shaken once every 15 minutes . Cell aggregates were removed by filtering cell suspension with 40 \u03bcm filter , and ammonium chloride solution ( Catalog #07850 , STEMCELL Technologies , USA ) was used for lysis of erythrocytes for 10 minutes at RT . Then , cell suspension was centrifuged at 1 , 200 rpm for 5 minutes and resuspended for subsequent experiments . When analyzing tumor cells from xenograft of human MDA-MB-231 model or PDX , mouse cells were excluded by gating in flow cytometry using H-2Kd-PE ( Clone SF1-1 . 1 , Cat 116607 , BioLegend , USA ) . Single cells from tumor or cell line were assessed for their ALDH activity using the ALDEFLUOR Kit ( Catalog #01700 , STEMCELL Technologies , USA ) following the manufacturer\u2019s procedures . Briefly , 1 \u00d7 106 cells were resuspended in 1 ml ALDEFLUOR buffer , and activated ALDEFLUOR substrate ( BAAA ) was added . Immediately , 300 \u03bcl of them were separated in another tube with the inhibitor DEAB ( Catalog #01705 , STEMCELL Technologies , USA ) . The incubation was performed for 40 minutes at 37\u00b0C , and then cells were resuspended with DAPI solution for the following flow cytometry analysis . In addition , single cells from tumor or cell line were also stained with CD24 antibody ( Cat 311118 , BioLegend , USA ) and CD44 antibody ( Cat 560532 , BD Pharmingen , USA ) for 30 minutes on ice and then resuspended with DAPI solution for flow cytometry analysis . A population of 10 , 000 living cells was captured and analyzed , and all fluorescence-activated cell sorting ( FACS ) experiments was performed using MOFLO ASTRIOS flow cytometer system ( BECKMAN COULTER , USA ) and software Summit 6 . 1 . Gating was based on \"Fluorescence Minus One\" controls . After cells were treated with taxol or docetaxel , they were collected to determine apoptosis with staining APC-Annexin V ( 550474 , BD Pharmingen ) following the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations . When carrying on flow cytometry , a population of 10 , 000 for all events was captured , and apoptosis population was analyzed by MOFLO ASTRIOS flow cytometer system ( BECKMAN COULTER , USA ) and software Summit 6 . 1 . High apoptosis indicates low ability of chemoresistance to taxane , and apoptosis defined by APC-positive population was switched to Chemoresistance Index according to the formula 1- ( Test-Ctrl ) /Ctrl . Ctrl is the contrast group that other groups were fold-changed to . Human breast tumor cells were cultured with MammoCult Human Medium Kit ( #05620 , STEMCELL Technologies , USA ) supplemented with 4 \u03bcg/mL Heparin ( #07980 , STEMCELL Technologies , USA ) , 1 \u03bcg/mL hydrocortisone ( Sigma , St . Louis , USA ) , and 1% pen-strep antibiotic ( Beyotime , China ) in 6-well ultralow attachment plates ( #3471 , Corning , USA ) ( 1 \u00d7 105 cells/mL medium ) for 7\u201310 days . Fresh complete mammocult medium was added every 3 days . After culture completed , spheres were collected and digested with 0 . 25% trypsin for about 6\u20138 minutes at 37\u00b0C . PBS with 2% FBS terminated digestion , and residual spheres not digested were removed by 40-\u03bcm filter . Cells were centrifuged with 1 , 200 rpm at 4\u00b0C for 5 minutes . Single cells were resuspended for subsequent experiments .

When analyzing the expression levels of each gene in results of RNA-seq , the threshold of expression value was set to 0 . 1 greater than what was believed to be credible . When RNA-seq results were used for GSEA of each gene set , pathway of nominal P value less than 0 . 05 was considered significant . Serum and cell culture supernatants were used to perform ELISA to determine CCL20 levels , following manufacturer\u2019s recommendations ( CODE: ELH-MIP3a , RayBiotech , USA ) . CCL20 levels were calculated according to the standard curve after the subtraction of the negative control signal when measuring the level of CCL20 in the patient\u2019s serum , which was called relative CCL20 level . Cell culture supernatants and mouse sera were collected and utilized to carry out human or mouse RayBio C-Series Cytokine Antibody Array ( Cat# AAH-CYT-1000 or Cat# AAM-CYT-1000 , RayBiotech , USA ) per the manufacturer\u2019s instruction .

We suggest not to boil the sample after lysis when preparing protein samples for ABCB1 determination by western blot . Next , 5% bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) dissolved in TBS containing 0 . 1% Tween-20 ( TBST ) was used for blocking and antibody dilution .

CCL20 expression was scored semiquantitatively by a manual histo-score ( H-score ) methodology based on staining intensity and percentage of positive tumor cells . Strongly staining scored 3 , moderately staining scored 2 , weakly staining scored 1 , and negatively staining scored 0 . The H-score of CCL20 expression is obtained by the formula 3 \u00d7 percentage of strongly staining + 2 \u00d7 percentage of moderately staining + percentage of weakly staining , giving a range of 0\u2013300 . Breast tumor cells ( 300\u2013500 cells per well ) were seeded in 96-well culture plates and cultured for 3 , 5 , or 7 days . MTT ( M-2128 , Sigma ) was added to reach the final concentration of 0 . 5 mg/mL , and the cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 4 hours , and then the supernatant was removed , and 100 \u03bcl of DMSO was added; the optical density ( OD ) value was measured at 490 nm after gently shaking for 10 minutes . Twenty thousand cells were seeded in the chambers with 8-\u03bcm pore size ( 0216 , BD ) coated with Matrigel ( 354234 , Corning ) and placed into 24-well culture plate . After 36 hours , cells in lower chambers were fixed and stained with 0 . 1% crystal violet , and the invaded cells were photographed by microscope to analyze the total numbers . Eight thousand cells per well were seeded in 2 X medium mixed with soft agar in 6-well culture plates and cultured in the incubator for approximately 4 weeks . Colonies were stained with 0 . 005% crystal violet , and then the number of colonies was analyzed . Bar graphs were generated with GraphPad Prism 7 , and all values are reported as the mean \u00b1 SEM . A 2-way ANOVA was used for multiple comparisons . Unless otherwise indicated , comparisons between 2 groups were performed using an unpaired , 2-tailed t test . P values of less than 0 . 05 were considered statistically significant .", "headings": ["Abstract", "Introduction", "Results", "Discussion", "Materials and methods"], "keywords": ["sequencing techniques", "flow cytometry", "cell motility", "innate immune system", "medicine and health sciences", "breast tumors", "immune physiology", "cytokines", "enzyme-linked immunoassays", "cancer treatment", "immunology", "clinical oncology", "cancers and neoplasms", "oncology", "developmental biology", "clinical medicine", "pharmaceutics", "molecular development", "molecular biology techniques", "rna sequencing", "immunologic techniques", "research and analysis methods", "cancer chemotherapy", "immunoassays", "breast cancer", "molecular biology", "chemotaxis", "spectrophotometry", "immune system", "cytophotometry", "chemotherapy", "cell biology", "physiology", "chemokines", "biology and life sciences", "drug therapy", "spectrum analysis techniques"], "id": "journal.pbio.2005869"}
{"lay_summary": "Toxoplasma gondii is an intracellular parasite capable of infecting virtually all warm-blooded animals , including humans . Toxoplasma\u2019s ability to manipulate and persist in the host is due in part to its secretion of effector proteins into the host cell .

The ability of Toxoplasma tachyzoites to infect and successfully manipulate its host is dependent on its ability to transport \u201cGRA\u201d proteins that originate in unique secretory organelles called dense granules into the host cell in which they reside . GRAs have diverse roles in Toxoplasma\u2019s intracellular lifecycle , including co-opting crucial host cell functions and proteins , such as the cell cycle , c-Myc and p38 MAP kinase . Some of these GRA proteins , such as GRA16 and GRA24 , are secreted into the parasitophorous vacuole ( PV ) within which Toxoplasma replicates and are transported across the PV membrane ( PVM ) into the host cell , but the translocation process and its machinery are not well understood . We previously showed that TgMYR1 , which is cleaved by TgASP5 into two fragments , localizes to the PVM and is essential for GRA transport into the host cell . To identify additional proteins necessary for effector transport , we screened Toxoplasma mutants defective in c-Myc up-regulation for their ability to export GRA16 and GRA24 to the host cell nucleus . Here we report that novel proteins MYR2 and MYR3 play a crucial role in translocation of a subset of GRAs into the host cell . MYR2 and MYR3 are secreted into the PV space and co-localize with PV membranes and MYR1 . Consistent with their predicted transmembrane domains , all three proteins are membrane-associated , and MYR3 , but not MYR2 , stably associates with MYR1 , whose N- and C-terminal fragments are disulfide-linked . We further show that fusing intrinsically disordered effectors to a structured DHFR domain blocks the transport of other effectors , consistent with a translocon-based model of effector transport . Overall , these results reveal a novel complex at the PVM that is essential for effector translocation into the host cell . \n Toxoplasma gondii is an obligate intracellular parasite with an extraordinary host range: it can infect virtually any nucleated cell in almost any warm-blooded animal . Upon infecting such a host , Toxoplasma differentiates into tachyzoites that rapidly disseminate throughout host tissues [1] . When a tachyzoite invades a host cell , it invaginates the host plasma membrane to form the parasitophorous vacuole ( PV ) , within which it replicates during its intracellular cycle [2] . Although the vacuole protects Toxoplasma from clearance by the innate immune system [3 , 4] , it also creates a barrier that the parasite must circumvent in order to effectively hijack the host and acquire essential nutrients . Toxoplasma\u2019s ability to hijack and persist in the host is due in part to its secretion of effector proteins that modulate host cell pathways , including an unknown effector responsible for up-regulation of host c-Myc [5\u201312] . All effector proteins so far identified within the host cell are secreted from unique organelles in the parasite , namely the rhoptries and dense granules . Two classes of dense granule effectors have recently emerged: the first class consists of proteins , such as MAF1 , GRA15 , and GRA6 , that localize to the nanotubular network and/or PV membrane ( PVM ) [5 , 13 , 14] , while the second class consists of proteins , such as GRA16 , GRA24 , and TgIST , that traverse the PVM and localize to the host cell nucleus [11 , 15\u201317] . GRA16 has been shown to affect p53 levels and PP2A-B nuclear translocation in the host . This key effector is predicted to be an intrinsically disordered protein with five nuclear localization signals and two internal repeats , one of which contains an \u201cRRL\u201d TEXEL ( Toxoplasma Export Element ) motif [11] . Cleavage of the TEXEL motif by Toxoplasma aspartyl protease V ( ASP5 ) is essential for GRA16 export across the PVM [18\u201320] . GRA24 includes an internal bipartite nuclear localization signal and two internal repeats [15] . It does not possess a TEXEL motif but is nonetheless dependent on ASP5 for its export [18\u201320] . GRA24 is also predicted to be an intrinsically disordered protein that interacts directly with p38\u03b1 MAP kinase via a kinase-interacting motif ( KIM ) [15 , 21] . This interaction results in the autophosphorylation of p38 MAPK and consequent activation of multiple host pathways , including upregulation of IL-12 and other pro-inflammatory cytokines . Although it is clear that GRA16 and GRA24 must cross the PVM to ultimately reach the host nucleus , how this happens has not yet been elucidated . In Plasmodium falciparum , effector translocation across the PVM has been shown to depend on the PTEX complex , which consists of an HSP101 AAA+ ATPase , EXP2 , PTEX150 , PTEX88 , and a thioredoxin domain-containing protein , TRX2 [22\u201324] . PTEX substrates that are fused to dihydrofolate reductase ( DHFR ) are still translocated into the erythrocyte cytosol; however , the addition of small molecules that stabilize the DHFR domain and prevent its unfolding effectively blocks transport , suggesting that substrates must be unfolded for translocation [25] . Consistent with this , knockdown of HSP101 AAA+ ATPase abrogates effector translocation [22 , 24] . In Toxoplasma , the protein and molecular components required for translocation across the PVM are not well understood . GRA17 and GRA23 form pores in the PVM that allow the diffusion of small molecules [26] , but these pores are not capable of translocating polypeptides and proteins . Using a mutagenesis screen , we recently identified a novel protein , MYR1 , which is essential for effector translocation across the PVM and , thus , for parasite virulence in a mouse model [27] . This protein seemed unlikely to act alone , however , and so we expanded our screen to identify other proteins that are essential for effector translocation . Here we report the identification of two novel membrane proteins , MYR2 and MYR3 , that are involved in effector translocation . Both proteins are found within the PV , and MYR3 stably associates with the previously identified MYR1 to form a novel complex . Furthermore , we show that the fusion of intrinsically disordered GRA16 to murine DHFR is sufficient to block its translocation , and this block affects the translocation of other effectors , which is consistent with a translocon model of effector transport . \n Toxoplasma gondii RH\u0394hpt and RH\u0394ku80\u0394hpt [28] strains were used for this study . Toxoplasma tachyzoites were maintained by serial passage in human foreskin fibroblasts ( HFFs ) cultured in complete Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle Medium ( cDMEM ) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) , 2 mM L-glutamine , 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 \u03bcg/ml streptomycin and grown at 37 \u00b0C in 5% CO2 . The HFFs were obtained from the neonatal clinic at Stanford University following routine circumcisions that are performed at the request of the parents for cultural , health or other personal medical reasons ( i . e . , not in any way related to research ) . These foreskins , which would otherwise be discarded , are fully de-identified and therefore do not constitute \u201chuman subjects research\u201d . Infections included in this study were performed by scraping infected monolayers and lysing the host cells open using a 27-gauge needle . The released parasites were spun down at 1500 rpm for 5\u201310 min , resuspended , counted using a hemocytometer , and added to confluent HFFs at the multiplicity of infection ( MOI ) stated . For whole genome sequencing on the parental RH strain ( SRR2068658 ) , MFM1 . 6 ( SRR2068655 ) , MFM1 . 7 ( SRR2068656 ) and MFM1 . 8 ( SRR2068657 ) mutants , a single Illumina PE barcoded library was prepared from tachyzoite genomic DNA ( gDNA ) . Libraries were then pooled into groups of nine samples and sequenced multiplexed in a single lane of an Illumina HiSeq 2000 machine to generate about 3 Gb of sequencing data per sample . As the mutants were made using the Type I RH strain as the parent , the sequencing reads were first quality trimmed with trimommatic and then mapped to the reference assembly of the Type I GT1 strain ( as present in ToxoDB v13 . 0 ) with bowtie2 [29] . After removing duplicated reads with picard and adjusting alignments around indels with GATK toolkit [30] , single nucleotide variants ( SNVs ) were called using samtools utility mpileup [31] requiring a minimum base coverage of 5 reads and an alternative allele frequency of at least 80% or higher . Following this , SnpEff [32] together with a gff3 annotation file from the reference GT1 strain ( ToxoDB v13 . 0 ) were used to classify the different types of SNVs present in each mutant . Potential change-of-function SNVs that were different between any of the three mutants and both the parental and reference strains were selected for further quality control and analysis . All transfections were performed using the BTX EMC600 Electroporation System ( Harvard Apparatus ) or Amaxa 4D Nucleofector ( Lonza ) model . Tachyzoites were mechanically released in PBS , pelleted , and resuspended in solution for transfection . After transfection , parasites were allowed to infect HFFs in DMEM . Transfections with the BTX EMC600 model were performed using 5\u201310 x 106 parasites and 15\u201325 \u03bcg DNA in Cytomix ( 10 mM KPO4 , pH 7 . 6 , 120 mM KCl , 5 mM MgCl2 , 25 mM HEPES , 2 mM EDTA , 150 \u03bcM CaCl2 ) . Transfections with the Amaxa 4D model were performed using 2\u20134 x 106 parasites in 20 \u03bcl P3 solution or 5\u201310 x 106 parasites in 100 \u03bcl P3 solution with 5\u201310 \u03bcg DNA . Effector translocation assays were performed by transiently transfecting pHTU-GRA24-3xMyc or pGRA1-GRA16-HA plasmid ( S1 File has a list of all primers , plasmids , and strains used in this study ) into tachyzoites , infecting monolayers of HFFs in DMEM , and fixing monolayers with formaldehyde at 16\u201324 hpi . The pGRA1-GRA16-HA plasmid , which expresses HA-tagged GRA16 off the GRA1 promoter , was generated by amplifying GRA16 from RH genomic DNA by PCR and cloning it into the NsiI and NcoI sites of pGRA-HPT-HA [6] . N-terminal glutathione S-transferase ( GST ) -fused proteins were expressed using the pGEX-6P1 plasmid ( Agilent Technologies ) . A portion of the C-terminal exon region of MYR1 was amplified using the primers F1 and R1 ( corresponding to amino acids 582\u2013693 , inclusive ) and cloned into the NotI and EcoRI sites of pGEX-6P1 to generate the pGEX 6P-1 MYR1[C]-A plasmid . The resulting recombinant protein was purified from Escherichia coli ( Rosetta strain; Novagen/EMD Millipore ) as previously described [33] and injected intraperitoneally into female BALB/c ( Charles River ) mice with Sigma Adjuvant System ( Sigma ) , according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions . Blood of naive mice was drawn prior to injection and those mice with sera that exhibited the lowest baseline reactivity against lysates and fixed monolayers of Toxoplasma-infected cells were selected for antibody generation . Mice were injected intraperitoneally ( i . p . ) with an initial dose of 100 \u03bcg protein/mouse followed by 50 \u03bcg protein/mouse boosts approximately every three weeks . Serum from these mice was isolated 14 days after each boost injection and tested on parasite lysates by Western blotting . All animal experiments were conducted with the approval and oversight of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Stanford University . Infected cells grown on glass coverslips were fixed using methanol at -20\u00b0C for 20 min or 3\u20134% formaldehyde at room temperature ( RT ) for 15 min , as stated in the text . Methanol-fixed samples were washed three times for 5 min with PBS and blocked using 3% BSA in PBS for 1h at RT . Formaldehyde-fixed samples were rinsed once with PBS , permeabilized with 0 . 2% Triton-X 100 ( TTX-100 ) for 20 min , and then blocked as described above . MYR1 ( N ) protein was detected with mouse anti-MYR1 antibodies [27] , while MYR1 ( C ) protein was detected with rat anti-HA antibodies or mouse anti-MYR1 primary antibodies . GRA7 protein was detected using rabbit anti-GRA7 antibodies [34] . GRA16-HA ( and other HA-tagged proteins ) was detected using rat anti-HA antibodies ( Roche ) while GRA24-Myc was detected using rabbit anti-Myc tag antibodies ( Cell Signaling Technologies ) . Primary antibodies were detected with goat polyclonal Alexa Fluor-conjugated secondary antibodies ( Invitrogen ) . Vectashield with DAPI stain ( Vector Laboratories ) was used to mount the coverslips on slides . Fluorescence was detected using a LSM710 inverted confocal microscope ( Zeiss ) or epifluorescence microscope , as stated in the text . Images were analyzed using ImageJ . All images shown for any given condition/staining in any given comparison/dataset were obtained using identical parameters . The RH\u0394myr2 , RH\u0394myr3 , and RH\u0394gra16 strains were generated by disrupting the corresponding gene loci using CRISPR-Cas9 and selecting for integration of a linearized vector encoding hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase ( HXGPRT ) using drug selection . Specifically , the pSAG1:U6-Cas9:sgUPRT vector [35] was modified by Q5 site-directed mutagenesis ( NEB ) to specify sgRNAs targeting exons in MYR2 ( F2 ) or MYR3 ( F3 ) or GRA16 ( F19 ) . The resulting sgRNA plasmids , dubbed pSAG1:U6-Cas9:sgMYR2 and pSAG1:U6-Cas9:sgMYR3 , respectively , were transfected into the RH\u0394hpt strain of Toxoplasma with pGRA-HPT-HA plasmid that had been linearized with NotI . The RH\u0394gra16 strain was generated by co-transfecting in the pSAG1:U6-Cas9:sgGRA16 and pTKO2C mCherry vector . The parasites were allowed to infect HFFs in 24-well plates for 24 h , after which the media was changed to complete DMEM supplemented with 50 \u03bcg/ml mycophenolic acid ( MPA ) and 50 \u03bcg/ml xanthine ( XAN ) for HXGPRT selection . The parasites were passed twice into 24-well plates before being single cloned into 96-well plates by limiting dilution . Disruption of the gene coding regions was confirmed by PCR ( MYR2: F4 , R4; MYR3: F5 , R5; GRA16: F20 , R20 ) and sequencing of the locus . The RH:MYR1-3xHA strain was generated by transfecting the pTKO2-MYR1-3085-3xHA vector into RH\u0394ku80\u0394hpt and selecting for integration with MPA and Xan . The pTKO2-MYR1-3085-3xHA plasmid is derived from the pTKO2-HPT-3xHA vector , which was generated by cloning 3xHA tag amplified from synthesized DNA ( IDT ) into the EcoRV and EcoRI sites of the previously described pTKO2C mCherry vector [36] . Approximately 3 , 000 bp of the MYR1 3\u2019 coding sequence and HA tag were amplified from RH genomic DNA using the F8 and R8 primers , and the resulting insert was cloned into the NotI and EcoRV sites of the pTKO2-HPT-3xHA vector . The plasmid was linearized at the SmaI site in the insert , and 25 \u03bcg of the linearized plasmid was transfected by electroporation . Parasites were allowed to infect HFFs in T25 flasks for 24 h , after which the medium was changed to complete DMEM supplemented with 50 \u03bcg/ml MPA and 50 \u03bcg/ml XAN for HXGPRT selection . Parasites were passaged twice before being singly cloned into 96-well plates by limiting dilution . Screening for correct integration into the endogenous locus was performed by PCR using multiple primers , including F9 and R9 . The RH:MYR2-3xHA strain was generated by transfecting the pTKO2-MYR2-1151-3xHA vector into RH\u0394ku80\u0394hpt and selecting for integration with MPA/XAN . The pTKO2-MYR2-1151-3xHA vector was constructed by amplifying approximately 1500 bp of the MYR2 3\u2019 coding sequence with F10 and R10 primers and cloning it into the NotI and EcoRV sites of the pTKO2-HPT-3xHA vector . The construct was then linearized with Bsu361 , and the linearized plasmid was transfected as described above . The RH:MYR2-3xHA62 strain was generated by amplifying ( F11 , R11 ) a 740 bp gBlock ( IDT ) in which MYR2 encodes a 3xHA tag starting at amino acid 62 and co-transfecting the purified product with pSAG1:U6-Cas9:sgMYR2-178 vector ( F13 ) into RH\u0394ku80\u0394hpt to create a double stranded break . The tag in the gene block is positioned to disrupt the PAM motif of the sgRNA target , which prevents targeting of the gBlock or integrated sequence . The RH:MYR3-3xHA strain was generated by amplifying approximately 700 bp of MYR3 3\u2019 coding and UTR sequence ( F12 , R12 ) synthesized with a C-terminal 3xHA tag ( IDT ) and co-transfecting it into RH\u0394ku80\u0394hpt with pSAG1:U6-Cas9:sgMYR3-C2 plasmid ( F14 ) . Parasites transiently expressing Cas9-GFP were enriched by FACS sorting at 24 hours post-infection , and the resulting population was allowed to infect HFFs in DMEM . The parasites were cloned by limiting dilution and screened for 3xHA integration at the MYR3 locus by PCR ( F15 and R15 ) and sequencing . The RH:MYR1 R577A strain was generated by amplifying ( F16 , R16 ) a gBlock ( IDT ) in which the codon for arginine at residue 577 of MYR1 is mutated to one for alanine . The resulting product was purified and co-transfected into RH:MYR1-HA [27] with pSAG1:U6-Cas9:sgMYR1 2081 . Transfected parasites were enriched by FACS sorting and cloned by limiting dilution , as described above . The RH\u0394myr3::MYR3 strain was complemented ectopically with the pGRA-MYR3-3xHA plasmid , which expresses MYR3 off its natural promoter . To construct the pGRA-MYR3-3xHA plasmid , the MYR3 promoter and open reading frame were amplified from RH\u0394hpt genomic DNA using F6 and R6 primers . The resulting ~2 kb fragment was digested with HindIII and NcoI restriction enzymes and cloned into the corresponding sites of the pGRA1-HPT-3xHA backbone . The resulting vector , pGRA-MYR3-3xHA , was linearized with NotI , and 5 \u03bcg of the linearized plasmid was co-transfected with 5 \u03bcg pSAG1:U6-Cas9:sgUPRT [35] into RH\u0394myr3 tachyzoites . Integration of the vector at the UPRT locus was enriched by selecting for resistance to 5 \u03bcM FUDR in DMEM after one lytic cycle . The resulting population was then cloned by limiting dilution and tested for MYR3-3xHA expression by Western blot and IFA . To construct the pGRA1-HPT-3xHA vector , a 296 bp double stranded DNA gene block ( IDT ) was designed to contain the sequence of the original pGRA1-HPT-HA plasmid from the NsiI site to the NcoI site , a triple HA tag and stop codon after the NcoI site , and a PacI site after the stop codon . The gene block was amplified , digested with NsiI and PacI restriction enzymes , and cloned into the corresponding sites of the pGRA1-HPT-HA plasmid . The RH\u0394myr2 strain was complemented ectopically by transient transfection with the pGRA1-MYR2-3xHA plasmid , which expresses C-terminally tagged MYR2 off the GRA1 promoter . The pGRA1-MYR2-3xHA plasmid is derived from the pGRA1plus-HPT-3xHA plasmid , which is derived from pGRA1-HPT-3xHA plasmid and includes two additional restriction sites and an extended GRA1 promoter . Approximately 2 kb of the MYR2 open reading frame ( ORF ) was amplified from RH genomic DNA using F7 and R7 primers and cloned into the pGRA1 NsiI and NcoI restriction sites of pGRA1 plus-HPT-3xHA by Gibson Assembly ( NEB ) . To assess complementation , 5 \u03bcg pGRA1-MYR2-3xHA plasmid was co-transfected with 5 \u03bcg GRA24-3xMyc plasmid , and effector translocation was assessed by IFA . The RH:MYR1-3xHA::GRA16-DHFR strain was generated by co-transfecting linearized pGRA1:GRA16-DHFR plasmid and pSAG1:U6-Cas9:sgUPRT plasmid into the RH:MYR1-3xHA strain and enriching for integration at the UPRT locus with FUDR , as described above . The pGRA1:GRA16-DHFR plasmid was generated by amplifying murine DHFR coding sequence from a gBlock ( IDT ) and cloning it into the NcoI and PacI sites of pGRA1:GRA16-HA , effectively replacing the HA tag with mDHFR . The pGRA1-GRA16-DHFR plasmid was linearized with NotI for transfection . The RH::MYR3-3xHA strain was made by transfecting RH\u0394hpt with pGRA-MYR3-3xHA and selecting for integration with MPA/XAN , as described above . The RH\u0394myr2::MYR3-3xHA strain was made by co-transfecting RH\u0394myr2 with pGRA-MYR3-3xHA and pSAG1:U6-Cas9:sgUPRT and selecting for UPRT disruption with FUDR , as described above . Tachyzoites were allowed to infect HFF monolayers for 20\u201324 h in DMEM . Infected monolayers were washed , mechanically disrupted in PBS with HALT protease and phosphatase inhibitors ( Thermo Fisher ) using a 27-gauge syringe , and spun down at 2500 x g to yield the low speed supernatant ( LSS ) and low-speed pellet ( LSP ) , the latter of which consists of parasites and large host cell debris . The LSP was resuspended in cell extraction buffer ( Invitrogen ) supplemented with HALT inhibitors , incubated on ice , spun at 20 , 000 x g to pellet nuclear debris , and the resulting supernatant was then saved at -20\u00b0C for analysis . The LSS fraction containing PV membranes and soluble material was further fractionated at 100 , 000 x g at 4\u00b0C for 1 h to yield the high-speed pellet ( HSP ) and high-speed supernatant ( HSS ) . The HSP was treated with PBS or 1% TTX-100 plus 0 . 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate ( SDS ) for 30\u201345 min on ice , and fractionated again at 100 , 000 x g at 4\u00b0C for 1 h . After the final centrifugation , HSP fractions were resuspended in cell extraction buffer ( Invitrogen ) , boiled in SDS sample buffer , and disrupted with a syringe for SDS-PAGE . HSS fractions were concentrated using TCA precipitation or centrifugal filters ( Cat#: XUFC201024 , EMD Millipore ) and boiled in sample buffer . To assess MYR3 phosphorylation , monolayers infected with RH:MYR3-3xHA tachyzoites were washed , mechanically disrupted , and fractionated as described above in PBS containing an EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail ( Roche ) plus or minus PhosStop phosphatase inhibitors ( Roche ) . Cell lysates were prepared at 20\u201324 hours post-infection ( hpi ) in cell extraction buffer ( Invitrogen ) plus protease and phosphatase inhibitors ( Roche , Thermo Fisher ) . Samples containing 10\u201320 \u03bcg protein were boiled for 10 min in sample buffer , separated by SDS-PAGE , and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride ( PVDF ) membranes . Membranes were blocked in 5% milk in TBS supplemented with 2 . 5% Tween-20 for 1 h at RT and then incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with primary antibody in blocking buffer . HA was detected using horseradish peroxidase ( HRP ) -conjugated HA antibody ( Roche ) . MAF1 was detected using rabbit anti-MAF1 antibodies [13] and GRA7 protein was detected using rabbit anti-GRA7 antibodies [34]; both were detected using goat anti-rabbit IgG ( H+L ) -HRP conjugate . MYR1 ( C ) and ( N ) terminal fragments were detected using mouse anti-MYR1 antibodies , while GRA1 was detected using mouse anti-GRA1 antibodies ( Biotem ) ; these antibodies were detected with goat anti-mouse IgG ( H+L ) -HRP conjugate . Horseradish peroxidase ( HRP ) was detected using enhanced chemiluminescence ( ECL ) kit ( Pierce ) . Membranes were stripped between blots by incubation in stripping buffer ( Thermo Fisher ) for 10\u201315 min then washed 2 x 5 min with PBS or TBS-T . Confluent monolayers of HFFs in 15-cm dishes were infected at MOI 1\u20132 with 3xHA-tagged parasites or untagged parental controls for 20\u201324 h . Infected monolayers were washed 3 times with ice-cold PBS , then scraped and mechanically disrupted with a 27-gauge syringe in lysis buffer ( 50 mM Tris , pH 7 . 6 , 200 mM NaCl , 1% TTX-100 , 0 . 5% CHAPS ) supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors ( Roche , Thermo Fisher ) . The lysate was sonicated 3 x 10 sec at 50% duty cycle , output control 2 with the Branson Sonifier 250 and left on ice for 30\u201345 min . The samples were spun at 1200 x g to pellet out any nuclei and remaining debris , and input was collected from the resulting supernatant . The remaining supernatant was incubated with magnetic beads conjugated to anti-HA antibodies ( Thermo Fisher ) overnight at 4\u00b0C with gentle rotation . The beads were washed twice with lysis buffer and four times with wash buffer ( 50 mM Tris , pH 7 . 6 , 300 mM NaCl , 0 . 1% TTX-100 ) using a magnetic rack . Bound peptides were eluted by incubating the beads with 2 mg/ml anti-HA peptide ( Thermo Fisher ) at 37\u00b0C for 15 min with gentle rotation . This study was carried out in strict accordance with the Public Health Service Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and AAALAC accreditation guidelines . The protocol was approved by Stanford University\u2019s Administrative Panel on Laboratory Animal Care ( Animal Welfare Assurance # A3213-01 , protocol # 9478 ) . All efforts were made to minimize suffering . \n Toxoplasma mutants unable to upregulate host c-Myc were isolated using a forward genetic screen , as previously described [27] . Briefly , bone marrow macrophages ( BMMs ) engineered to express GFP fused to c-Myc were infected with mCherry-expressing Toxoplasma tachyzoites that had been chemically mutagenized with ethylnitrosourea ( ENU ) . Successive FACS sorts were performed to enrich for BMMs that were infected with tachyzoites incapable of modulating host c-Myc regulation ( i . e . , had a Myr- phenotype ) . Initial screening of these mutant populations yielded 3 independent mutants with a defect in GRA16 and GRA24 translocation across the PVM; whole genome sequencing revealed each of the 3 mutants had a distinct nonsense mutation in a gene dubbed MYR1 ( TGGT1_254470 ) [27] . The previously published work showed that MYR1 localizes to the PVM and is necessary for GRA16 and GRA24 effector translocation . Based on precedent in other protein translocation systems , however , we hypothesized that multiple proteins are involved and set out to identify these other proteins . To do this , we performed Western blots on 13 additional mutants isolated from the original Myr- population to test for the expression of full-length MYR1 protein , which indicates that they may be mutated in other crucial genes . Of these 13 clones , 8 appeared wild-type for MYR1 , indicating they likely harbored a mutation in a different gene involved in the Myr- phenotype , and the presence of a wild-type MYR1 locus was confirmed by PCR amplification and sequencing of the MYR1 locus ( Fig 1A ) . Three of these mutants ( MFM1 . 6 , MFM1 . 7 , and MFM1 . 8 ) were chosen at random for whole-genome sequencing to identify the mutated genes that might underlie their Myr- phenotype . Genomic sequencing revealed the expected range of 7 to 18 coding mutations in the three mutants ( Table 1 ) . Mutant MFM1 . 8 had no mutation in any gene that was also mutated in MFM1 . 7 and MFM1 . 6 , but it did have a nonsense mutation in gene TGGT1_270700 ( Q174* ) . This appeared the most likely candidate for the phenotype-causing mutation in the MFM1 . 8 mutant given that it was the only stop codon acquired and TGGT1_270700 is predicted to encode a novel , secreted protein . To test this hypothesis , we amplified the TGGT1_270700 locus in the other 5 MYR1-wild-type Myr- mutants to see if any were independently mutated in this gene . We found that one such mutant , MFM1 . 13 , had an independent nonsense mutation ( Y274* ) in TGGT1_270700 . This strongly argued for TGGT1_270700 being key to the c-Myc up-regulation phenotype . The MFM1 . 6 mutant also had a single nonsense mutation and this was in a gene , TGGT_237230 , which initially appeared to be unaltered , in terms of coding mutations , in the other two sequenced mutants . On further inspection , however , it was apparent that TGGT1_237230 was misannotated in ToxoDB and that a region originally called as an intron is in fact part of the coding region in the vast majority of transcripts . Using this corrected coding region and reanalyzing the MFM1 . 7 sequencing data revealed that MFM1 . 7 had a missense mutation in TGGT1_237230 ( 1 ) , strongly suggesting mutations in this gene are responsible for the Myr- phenotype in the MFM1 . 6 and MFM1 . 7 mutants . PCR sequencing of the loci described here in the remaining 4 MYR1 wild-type mutants indicated all were clones of MFM1 . 7 and so these were not further pursued . Having identified novel Myr- mutants , we next asked whether they are defective in effector translocation or in c-Myc up-regulation only . To test this , we independently transfected the MFM1 . 6 , MFM1 . 7 , and MFM1 . 8 mutants with a GRA16-HA plasmid and assessed effector protein localization by immunofluorescence assay ( IFA ) . The results showed that all three mutants have a defect in the translocation of GRA16 across the PVM to the host nucleus , indicating that these mutants are indeed defective in the machinery responsible for the translocation of effectors rather than in an effector that mediates host c-Myc upregulation ( Fig 1B ) . To verify that TGGT1_270700 and TGGT1_237230 are responsible for the Myr- phenotype , we generated strains disrupted in the first exon of each gene; specifically , we co-transfected CRISPR-Cas9 sgRNA plasmid modified to target the first exon of the relevant gene along with linearized pGRA1-HA-HPT plasmid , which contains the HXGPRT selectable marker , into RH\u0394hpt parasites ( Figs 2A and 3A ) . Following selection with mycophenolic acid and xanthine , we cloned the populations by limiting dilution and confirmed disruptive integration of the vector in the first exon of each gene by performing PCR ( Figs 2B and 3B ) and submitting the product for sequencing . To assess the role of these genes in effector translocation , we transfected the parental strain and RH\u0394270700 and RH\u0394237230 strains with GRA24-myc plasmid and assessed GRA24 localization by IFA . The results show that TGGT1_270700 and TGGT1_237230 are indeed essential for effector translocation , and we therefore dubbed them MYR2 and MYR3 , respectively ( Figs 2C , 2D , 3C and 3D ) . The MYR2-disrupted line was complemented ectopically by transient expression of MYR2-3xHA off the GRA1 promoter along with pHTU-GRA24-Myc . We first attempted to express MYR2-3xHA off the MYR2 promoter , but we were unable to visualize the HA-tagged protein by this method , likely due to its low protein expression , as discussed below . GRA24 localization was then assessed by IFA and compared to wild-type and RH\u0394myr2 strains transfected with the pHTU-GRA24-Myc plasmid alone . The results showed that the parental and complemented parasites had robust GRA24 localization in the vacuole and infected host cell nucleus while RH\u0394myr2 had robust signal in the vacuole but not in the host nucleus ( Fig 2C and 2D ) . This confirmed MYR2 as a gene necessary for protein translocation of effectors across the PVM . RH\u0394myr3 parasites were ectopically complemented by co-transfecting the CRISPR-Cas9 construct targeting UPRT and a construct expressing MYR3-3xHA off its native promoter . Complemented lines harboring a disruption of UPRT and integration of MYR3-3xHA at the UPRT locus were enriched with FUDR selection . To confirm the importance of MYR3 in effector translocation , we transfected the WT , RH\u0394myr3 , and RH\u0394myr3::MYR3 strains with a plasmid expressing GRA24-Myc and assessed GRA24 localization by IFA . The results showed a substantial defect in GRA24 nuclear localization in cells infected with RH\u0394myr3 parasites , but not parental or complemented parasites , confirming MYR3 is an essential component for effector translocation ( Fig 3C and 3D ) . GRA16 , GRA24 , and IST have not been shown to affect growth in vitro , and our previous work has shown that deletion of MYR1 does not affect the number of parasites per vacuole in vitro 22 hours post infection ( hpi ) . To determine if loss of MYR2 or MYR3 affects growth at a similarly early time point , we assessed the number of parasites per vacuole in HFFs infected with RH wild type , RH\u0394myr2 , RH\u0394myr3 , or RH\u0394myr3::MYR3-3xHA tachyzoites 20 hpi . Consistent with our previous results for MYR1 , we found no apparent defect in growth for RH\u0394myr2 and RH\u0394myr3 tachyzoites ( Fig 4A ) at 20 hpi . This is a relatively early time point , however , and so to determine if loss of MYR1 , MYR2 , or MYR3 have even a subtle effect on growth , we infected HFFs with tachyzoites from these same strains , fixed the monolayers at 6 days post infection , and measured plaque size . The results showed a small but significant defect in plaque size for \u0394myr1 , \u0394myr2 , and \u0394myr3 strains , that at least in the case of \u0394myr1 and \u0394myr3 was rescued by the relevant complementation ( Fig 4B and 4C; we were unable to obtain a stable complement of the \u0394myr2 mutant ) . This indicates that MYR1 , MYR2 and MYR3 are all necessary for fully wild type growth , even in vitro , and suggests that one or more effectors translocated by the MYR1/2/3-dependent machinery has a role in growth in HFFs . MYR2 is located on chromosome VIII and is predicted by ToxoDB ( v32 ) to have two introns and encode a protein of ~32 kDa , including a predicted N-terminal signal peptide ( probability 0 . 672 by SignalP 2 . 0 HMM ) and , by TMpred , two transmembrane ( TM ) domains between amino acids 43\u201360 and 261\u2013279 ( Fig 5A ) . Microarray and RNA-Seq data available in ToxoDB ( v32 ) show that this gene is expressed in tachyzoites and sporozoites ( FPKM values of ~50\u2013100 ) and to a lesser extent in bradyzoites ( FPKM and microarray values about 1/10th those seen with tachyzoites ) but it is essentially off in the enteroepithelial stages found in felines ( FPKM <2 ) . Phosphoproteomics analysis indicates two potential phosphorylation sites on residues 162 and/or 167 [37; ToxoDB v32] . BLAST analysis shows MYR2 has an orthologue in Neospora caninum ( NCLIV_036070 ) although it shows only 39% amino acid identity to the Toxoplasma protein ( S1 Fig ) . Interestingly , the strongest conservation between the two orthologues is in the C-terminal-most 69 amino acids which are 71% identical and this region includes one of the two strongly predicted TM domains . The more N-terminal predicted TM domain ( amino acids 43\u201360 ) is conserved in overall hydrophobicity and thus is still strongly predicted to be a TM in the Neospora sequence , but the exact amino acid sequences in this region are not well conserved . No orthologue of MYR2 is detected in Sarcocystis or the more distantly related genus , Plasmodium . Unlike MYR1 , MYR2 does not appear to have a \u201cRRL\u201d TEXEL motif that would target it for cleavage by ASP5 [18\u201320] . MYR3 is located on chromosome X and is annotated by ToxoDB ( v32 ) as having three introns; however , the first and third such predicted introns are spliced out in <1% of the transcripts whereas intron 2 is removed from almost all this gene\u2019s mRNAs . The ORF predicted by removal of just intron 2 encodes a protein of 192 amino acids with no signal peptide but a strongly predicted ( by TMpred ) TM domain between residues 79\u2013101 , which could act as an internal signal sequence to route the protein through the secretory pathway ( Figs 5A and S2 ) . RNASeq and microarray data show that MYR3 is well expressed in tachyzoites and sporozoites ( FPKM ~200\u2013800 in both ) , less so in bradyzoites ( FPKM ~60 ) , and essentially off in the enteroepithelial stages ( FPKM <1; ToxoDB v32 ) . Interestingly , a few of the non-canonical Toxoplasma strains show a deletion of ~250 bp in their 3\u2019-UTR sequence relative to the well-studied RH , ME49 and VEG strains but the impact of this on the gene\u2019s function is not known ( [38]; ToxoDB v32 ) . Interestingly , MYR3 shows a high number of spectral counts for phosphorylated serine residues in the context of intracellular infection , but not in the purified parasites , suggesting that the protein is phosphorylated outside of the parasite\u2019s boundaries [37; ToxoDB v32] . BLAST analysis indicated that , like MYR1 and MYR2 , MYR3 has a somewhat conserved orthologue in Neospora caninum ( BN1204_051095 ) with 35% identity over the N-terminal most 181 amino acids ( S2 Fig ) and no detectable orthologue in Plasmodium . The presence of a predicted TM domain is also conserved in the Neospora version of the protein at amino acids 83\u201399 . As with MYR2 , MYR3 does not have a recognizable \u201cRRL\u201d TEXEL motif . In a previous study , we showed that MYR1 is essential for effector translocation and is cleaved into two fragments , both of which are found within the PV space and at the PVM [27] . To determine if MYR1 ( N ) - and ( C ) -termini precisely co-localize , which was not previously done , we performed confocal immunofluorescence on RH:MYR1-3xHA strain , which has a 3xHA tag endogenously fused to the MYR1 ( C ) -terminus , using anti-HA antibodies and antibodies raised to the native MYR1 ( N ) domain to detect the two portions individually . The results show that MYR1 ( N ) and ( C ) -termini indeed co-localize at the PV membrane ( Fig 5B ) . To determine the localization of MYR2 , we endogenously modified the gene to express a 3xHA tag either immediately before the stop codon ( RH:MYR2-3xHA ) or after the predicted transmembrane domain , at amino acid residue 62 ( RH:MYR2-3xHA62 ) . Although , as discussed further below , both parasite lines yielded a protein product migrating at about 40 kDa by Western blot , neither yielded a visible signal by standard IFA procedures . The failure to detect the endogenously tagged MYR2 protein by IFA could be due to low protein expression levels . To overcome this , we expressed MYR2-3xHA ectopically off the GRA1 promoter by transient transfection , fixed infected monolayers with methanol , and probed its localization by IFA . The results showed that MYR2 localizes to the PV space and , to some degree , to the PV membrane; it also shows some co-localization with GRA7 , a protein known to be localized to the intravacuolar network ( IVN ) and PVM [10 , 39] , and with MYR1 in the PV space and membrane ( Fig 5C ) . While these results were obtained with over-expression , they do strongly suggest that MYR2 is IVN- and PVM-associated . To determine the localization of MYR3 , we first generated the RH:MYR3-3xHA strain , in which a 3xHA tag is fused endogenously to the 3\u2019-end of the sequence coding for the C-terminus of MYR3 , and then used it to infect HFF monolayers . Infected monolayers were fixed with methanol at 12\u201316 hours , stained with antibodies against HA , MYR1 , or GRA7 , and then visualized by confocal microscopy . The results indicate that MYR3-3xHA has robust co-localization with GRA7 and MYR1 within the PV and at the PVM ( Fig 5D ) . Given this localization , we then assessed whether correct localization of either MYR1 , MYR2 , or MYR3 depends on either of the other MYR proteins . To determine if MYR1 localization depends on MYR2 or MYR3 , we infected monolayers with RH , RH\u0394myr2 , or RH\u0394myr3 tachyzoites and stained for MYR1 ( N ) and , as a control , GRA7 , using antibodies raised to recombinant versions of these proteins . The results showed that MYR1 ( N ) localizes to the PV and PVM for all three strains with no detectable difference between them ( S3 Fig ) , thereby indicating that MYR1\u2019s localization is not dependent on MYR2 or MYR3 . To determine if MYR2 localization depends on MYR1 or MYR3 , we transiently transfected RH\u0394myr1 , RH\u0394myr2 , and RH\u0394myr3 tachyzoites with a construct expressing MYR2-3xHA and assessed MYR2 localization by IFA with HA antibodies . We again found no apparent difference in MYR2-3xHA localization between the three strains ( S4 Fig ) , suggesting that MYR2 localization does not depend on MYR1 or MYR3 . To assess MYR3 localization in RH\u0394myr2 parasites , we ectopically integrated MYR3-3xHA expressed off its natural promoter in RH and RH\u0394myr2 parasites and stained for MYR3-3xHA with HA antibodies . MYR3-3xHA similarly localized to the PV membrane and space in both strains ( S5 Fig ) , indicating that MYR2 is not necessary for correct localization of MYR3 . MYR1 , MYR2 , and MYR3 are all bioinformatically predicted to have transmembrane domains . Given their localization within the PV and at the PVM ( Fig 5 ) , we next asked if they are indeed membrane-associated . To test this , we performed fractionation experiments in which HFFs were infected with the relevant RH tachyzoites for 20\u201324 hours , mechanically lysed in PBS to release the parasites , and then spun at 2500 x g to pellet intact parasites , host nuclei , and other debris . The resulting pellet , referred to as the low-speed pellet ( LSP ) , was resuspended in lysis buffer , while the supernatant containing PV membranes and host cell material was fractionated at 100 , 000 x g to isolate the high-speed supernatant ( HSS ) and high-speed pellet ( HSP ) fractions . To first determine if MYR1 ( C ) and ( N ) are membrane-associated or soluble , we performed SDS-PAGE on the fractions from HFFs infected with RH:MYR1-3xHA parasites and blotted for the MYR1 C-terminus with HA antibodies and the MYR1 N-terminus with antibodies raised to the N-terminal domain of MYR1 . The fractions were also blotted with antibodies against GRA7 , an integral PVM protein [40] and GRA1 , a soluble dense granule protein secreted by Toxoplasma into the PV space [41] , as controls . The results ( Fig 6A ) showed that , outside of the parasite , both MYR1 ( C ) and ( N ) fragments are in the HSP fractions . Importantly , GRA7 , shown previously to be within PV membranes [40] , is also primarily in the HSP fraction , while GRA1 is in the HSS . To ensure that the pellet fraction consists primarily of PVM membranes and not intact parasites , we blotted with antibodies against SAG1 , a GPI-anchored parasite surface antigen . The results showed that , as expected , almost no SAG1 is in the HSP , thereby indicating that MYR1\u2019s presence in this fraction is not a result of contamination with intact parasites . The presence of protein in the pellet may be the result of membrane association or protein aggregation . To determine whether MYR1 is released by detergents into the supernatant , which is consistent with membrane association , we sonicated the HSP in PBS or detergents , incubated it on ice for 45 minutes , and fractionated again at 100 , 000 x g . The resulting fractions were then resolved by SDS-PAGE and probed by Western blot . The results showed that both MYR1 fragments are released by detergents into the supernatant , indicating membrane association rather than protein aggregation ( Fig 6B ) . To determine if MYR2 and MYR3 are also membrane-associated , we performed similar experiments on HFFs infected with RH tachyzoites endogenously HA-tagged at the MYR2 or MYR3 locus . The results showed that MYR2 and MYR3 are predominantly in the HSP fraction , not the HSS ( Fig 6C and 6D ) , and the pelleted protein is released by detergents into the supernatant ( Fig 6B ) . The somewhat slower-than-predicted mobility of MYR2 ( it migrates as if 40 kDa whereas it is predicted to be about 32 kDa ) may be related to its acidic pI ( 4 . 7 ) and/or phosphorylation , both of which can retard a protein\u2019s mobility [42] . Interestingly , MYR3 was detected as a doublet that is most visible in the pellet fraction ( Fig 6D ) . To determine if the doublet is due to phosphorylation , we repeated the fractionation in the presence or absence of phosphatase inhibitors and analyzed the pellet fractions for MYR3-3xHA by Western blot . We found that the slower migrating band was substantially decreased in the absence of phosphatase inhibitors relative to the control ( Fig 6E ) , consistent with this upper band being a phosphorylated form , the existence of which was previously reported in phosphoproteome analyses [37] . As previously shown , MYR1 is cleaved into N- and C-terminal fragments that run at approximately 80 kDa and 32 kDa , respectively [27] . Given that the two fragments co-localize and show similar fractionation patterns , despite MYR1 ( N ) not having a predicted transmembrane domain , we assessed whether the two fragments stably associate . To do this , we performed immunoprecipitations using anti-HA antibodies on HFFs infected 20\u201324 hpi with RH:MYR1-3xHA tachyzoites expressing C-terminally tagged MYR1 or with untagged tachyzoites as a control . The resulting inputs and eluates were boiled in sample buffer containing dithiothreitol ( +DTT ) , resolved by SDS-PAGE , and probed for MYR1 ( C ) and MYR1 ( N ) using antibodies to the corresponding recombinant fragment . The results ( Fig 7A ) showed that MYR1 ( N ) specifically co-precipitated with MYR1 ( C ) , indicating that the two proteins are stably associating ( note that the migration of the C-terminal MYR1 domain is somewhat retarded by addition of the triple-HA tag , as expected ) ; no such precipitation was seen using the untagged RH strain as a negative control . To check for specificity , we also blotted for MAF1 , an integral membrane protein that localizes to the PV membrane and mediates mitochondrial association [13] . As expected , MAF1 was not co-precipitated ( Fig 7A ) . To determine whether the interaction between the MYR1 ( N ) and ( C ) domains is mediated by disulfide bonds ( both domains include at least one cysteine residue ) , we repeated the analysis and excluded DTT from the sample buffer ( -DTT ) . As a positive control for full-length protein , we used a strain with a mutant form of MYR1 ( RH:MYR1-HA R557A ) in which the ASP5-dependent cleavage site is mutated , resulting in unprocessed MYR1 ( lane 10 ) . Omitting DTT from the sample buffer resulted in both the N-terminal and C-terminal fragments running at about the size of the uncleaved protein , indicating that N- and C-terminal domains of MYR1 associate in a disulfide-dependent manner ( Fig 7A ) . As previously observed [27] , a small amount of uncleaved product was present even in the presence of DTT ( lane 5 ) , indicating either incomplete processing by ASP5 or incomplete reduction by DTT . To determine if MYR1 stably interacts with MYR2 , we performed immunoprecipitations on HFFs infected with RH:MYR2-3xHA62 and an untagged RH control , as described above . The resulting inputs and eluates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and probed by Western blotting with antibodies to the HA-tag , MYR1 ( N ) or MYR1 ( C ) . The results showed no evidence for association of either MYR1 domain with MYR2 ( Fig 7B ) . We cannot rule out that MYR1 and MYR2 interact transiently , or that the apparent lack of an association is an artifact of the conditions used; however , the results suggest that MYR2 does not stably associate with MYR1 . To determine if MYR1 interacts with MYR3 , we infected HFFs with RH:MYR3-3xHA or untagged RH tachyzoites and repeated the immunoprecipitations and Western blotting described above . Immunoprecipitation from MYR3-3xHA-infected cells is inefficient relative to immunoprecipitations using cells infected with the MYR1-3xHA and MYR2-3xHA-expressing parasites , and does not give a high yield in the eluate . Nevertheless , blotting with HA antibodies showed that some MYR3-3xHA is precipitated in the tagged eluate and that both fragments of MYR1 co-precipitate with MYR3 ( Fig 7C ) . As a control for specificity , we also probed for MAF1 with anti-MAF1 antibodies and saw no detectable MAF1 co-precipitation , confirming that the interaction of MYR3 and MYR1 is specific . Interestingly , the ratio of the precipitated MYR1 ( C ) fragment relative to the input is similar to the ratio for precipitated and input MYR3 , suggesting that the interaction could be stoichiometric , although more careful biochemical studies will be needed to conclude this definitively . Three of the Toxoplasma effectors that are transported across the PVM , namely GRA16 , GRA24 , and IST , appear to be highly disordered [11 , 15 , 16] , which may be important for their translocation . Previous work has shown that fusion of GRA16 to DHFR , which rapidly folds into a highly structured domain , blocks GRA16 transport across the PVM [19] , even in the absence of domain-stabilizing compounds . To determine if this block on GRA16-DHFR transport affects PVM translocation of other effectors , which would be predicted in a translocon-based model of protein transport , we expressed GRA16-DHFR ectopically and assessed the effect of this fusion on GRA16 and GRA24 transport . In good agreement with previous results , we found that whereas ( non-DHFR-fused ) GRA16-HA localized to the PV space and trafficked to the host nucleus , GRA16-DHFR accumulated in the vacuole and was rarely visible ( < 10% ) in the host cell nucleus ( Fig 8A ) . To determine if this block on GRA16-DHFR transport affects translocation of other effectors , such as GRA24 , we transiently transfected the parental and GRA16-DHFR-expressing strains with a Myc-tagged GRA24 plasmid and assessed GRA24 localization by IFA . We found that expression of GRA16-DHFR significantly reduced GRA24 localization to the host cell nucleus ( Fig 8B ) , suggesting that either GRA16-DHFR impedes the translocation machinery or that GRA24 directly depends on a fully functional GRA16 for this process , e . g . , through some sort of specific association or \u201cpiggy-backing\u201d . Notably , unlike GRA16 , GRA24 lacks the RRL motif cleaved by ASP5 and does not appear to be cleaved elsewhere , yet still depends on ASP5 for its transport across the PVM [18 , 19] . To determine if GRA24 translocation depends on GRA16 , we transiently transfected wild type , RH\u0394gra16 , and RH\u0394gra16::GRA16-HA tachyzoites with the GRA24-Myc plasmid [18] and assessed GRA24 localization by IFA . The results ( Fig 8C ) showed no difference in GRA24 translocation between the strains , indicating that GRA24 translocation does not intrinsically depend on GRA16 and that the effect of GRA16-DHFR is through nonspecific blocking of the translocation machinery . \n In this study we have identified a novel membrane complex of at least 3 polypeptides\u2014MYR1 ( N ) , MYR1 ( C ) , and MYR3\u2014that is essential for effector translocation across the vacuolar membrane into the host cell . Specifically , we have identified two novel parasite proteins , MYR2 and MYR3 , that are essential for effector translocation and show that they co-localize with GRA7 and MYR1 in the PV space and PVM . Consistent with their predicted transmembrane domains , MYR1 , MYR2 , and MYR3 all associate with membranes outside of the parasite\u2019s boundaries . Furthermore , co-immunoprecipitation experiments reveal that MYR1 ( N ) - and ( C ) -termini stably interact in a disulfide-dependent manner and that MYR3 , but not MYR2 , stably associates with MYR1 , indicating a complex of at least 3 polypeptide chains . It is unclear why MYR1 is cleaved into two fragments that nonetheless associate in a disulfide-dependent manner , but this may play an important regulatory function . Although we did not see any interaction between MYR1 and MYR2 , we cannot rule out that these proteins transiently interact and/or that the apparent lack of association is an artifact of the conditions used . The precise role of MYR1 , MYR2 and MYR3 in effector translocation is unclear , but given their localization and membrane association , MYR1 and MYR3 seem likely to form part of a novel complex that directly transports effector proteins across the membrane . The lack of stable association and the low protein abundance of MYR2 relative to MYR1 and MYR3 suggest that MYR2 may function differently , even though all three proteins are clearly essential for GRA16 and GRA24 translocation . Furthermore , MYR1 , MYR2 , and MYR3 show similar patterns of expression between different developmental stages of Toxoplasma based on RNASeq and microarray data , consistent with a coordinated function . Interestingly , we found that MYR1 , MYR2 , and MYR3 are not necessary for normal growth within one lytic cycle , but their absence does have a measurable effect on growth over multiple lytic cycles . This suggests that one or more MYR-dependent effectors contributes to the parasite\u2019s ability to grow in HFFs in vitro , but the identity of this effector remains to be determined . In our previous work , we showed that mice infected with Type I ( RH ) \u0394myr1 tachyzoites have a delayed time to death , while mice infected with Type II ( ME49 ) \u0394myr1 tachyzoites show a significant decrease in virulence and survive infection [27] . These results are consistent with the important role that effectors whose translocation is dependent on MYR1 , such as GRA16 , have been reported to have on virulence [11 , 16] . Given that mutants disrupted in MYR1 , MYR2 and MYR3 all have essentially identical phenotypes with regard to in vitro growth and defective effector translocation , it is highly likely that they will also show similar virulence phenotypes in mice . Like MYR1 , clear orthologues of MYR2 and MYR3 are present in Neospora caninum , consistent with their function as a translocon . Surprisingly , however , the level of conservation between the two genera for all three proteins is modest: 45% , 39% and 35% for MYR1 , MYR2 and MYR3 , respectively . This suggests that the translocation machinery has been subject to selection for optimal efficiency with their respective cargoes . Interestingly , none of these MYR proteins have homologues in Plasmodium and , similarly , the PTEX machinery that translocates secreted Plasmodium proteins across the PVM in an infected red blood cell is not functionally conserved in Toxoplasma; while there are two homologs of PfEXP2 in Toxoplasma , GRA17 and GRA23 , these have recently been shown to function in the translocation of small molecules ( <1800 daltons ) across the PVM , not proteins [26] . The requirements for translocation across Toxoplasma\u2019s PVM are not well understood , but they appear to differ from those for Plasmodium . Fusion of PTEX substrates in Plasmodium to highly ordered domains such as DHFR and GFP does not significantly affect their transport unless a stabilizing molecule that prevents their unfolding is added; however , for Toxoplasma , addition of a highly structured domain , such as DHFR , to the GRA16 effector is sufficient to block export even in the absence of additional stabilizing compounds , as reported here and elsewhere [19 , 43] . Importantly , the fusion of GRA16 to DHFR also impedes the translocation of GRA24; this is similar to the \u201cblockage\u201d effects that have been reported for protein translocons in other systems [44] and is consistent with the existence of a translocon at the PVM rather than a less constrained mechanism for protein translocation across this membrane . Overall , our results show that a novel membrane protein complex is essential for translocation and is at the right time and place to be the PVM translocon; however , further work will be needed to definitively determine if the complex operates in this role or as part of an accessory complex that functions upstream or downstream of the actual translocon .", "headings": ["Abstract", "Introduction", "Methods and materials", "Results", "Discussion"], "keywords": ["medicine and health sciences", "parasite groups", "viral transmission and infection", "microbiology", "parasitic diseases", "parasitic protozoans", "parasitology", "plasmid construction", "membrane proteins", "mutation", "apicomplexa", "tachyzoites", "protozoans", "toxoplasma", "immunoprecipitation", "nonsense mutation", "dna construction", "molecular biology techniques", "cellular structures and organelles", "research and analysis methods", "molecular biology", "cell membranes", "precipitation techniques", "eukaryota", "host cells", "cell biology", "virology", "genetics", "biology and life sciences", "organisms"], "id": "journal.ppat.1006828"}

As a nuclear double stranded DNA plasmid , the papillomavirus ( PV ) genome resembles a mini-chromosome in infected cells . To initiate its replication , the viral E2 protein binds to and recruits the E1 DNA helicase at the viral origin . PV genome replication program exhibits three stages: initial amplification from a single genome upon infection to a few copies per cell , a cell cycle linked maintenance phase , and a differentiation dependent late stage where the genome is amplified to thousands of copies . Involvement of ORC or other pre-replication complex ( pre-RC ) factors has not been described . We report that human PV ( HPV ) and bovine PV ( BPV-1 ) E2 proteins bind to ORC2 , however , ORC2 was not detected at the viral origin . Depletion of ORC2 enhanced PV replication in a transient replication model and in keratinocytes stably maintaining viral episomes , while there was no effect on copy number in a cell line with integrated HPV genomes . Consistent with this , occupancy of E1 and E2 at the viral origin increased following ORC2 silencing . These data imply that ORC2 is not necessary for activation of the PV origin by E1 and E2 but instead suppresses E2 replicative function . Furthermore , we observed that over-expression of HPV E2 decreased ORC2 occupation at two known mammalian origins of replication , suggesting that E2 restricts pre-ORC assembly that could otherwise compete for host replication complexes necessary for viral genome amplification . We infer that the ORC2 complex with E2 restricts viral replication in the maintenance phase of the viral replication program and that elevated levels of E2 that occur during the differentiation dependent amplification stage subvert ORC loading and hence DNA synthesis at cellular origins . \n Papillomaviruses ( PV ) are medically important pathogens especially as specific genotypes carry a high risk of progression to cancer , most commonly of the uterine cervix and oropharynx . Because PVs have limited protein coding capacity in their typically 8 kilobases ( kb ) genome , these viruses do not encode a DNA polymerase and must rely on host DNA replication factors . The viral genome replicates and is maintained as circular covalently closed double stranded , histone coated DNA plasmids in infected cells , thus resembling multi-copy mini-chromosomes . The viral genome replicative program consists of three stages [1 , 2] . Upon virus infection , its genome enters the nucleus of basal level epithelial cells and establishes a low copy number ( 1 to perhaps 50 ) . In the second \u2018maintenance\u2019 stage , these episomes duplicate as host epithelial cells replicate and depart the basal cell and suprabasal compartments [3 , 4] . Monolayer keratinocyte cultures that harbor viral episomes reflect this stage of virus replication . During this stage , the autonomous viral genomes segregate in mitosis as a kinetochore independent mini-chromosome . E2 protein binding to ChlR1 and Brd4 was shown to mediate attachment of the viral DNA to host chromosomes that is necessary for mitotic partitioning and nuclear retention of viral episomes [5 , 6] . The third \u2018amplification\u2019 stage occurs in upper epithelial strata where non-dividing epithelial cells persist in a prolonged S/G2 phase [7] . In these cells , the viral episomes replicate to hundreds of episomes that are packaged into nascent virion particles . Many of our insights into PV replication proteins emerged from studies of bovine papillomavirus type-1 ( BPV ) , which is maintained as a stable replicating episome in murine NIH3T3 and C127 cell lines . Its E2 protein is composed of an N-terminal 220 amino acid transactivation domain ( TAD ) , a non-conserved hinge region , and a C-terminal dimerization and DNA binding domain [8] . The TAD mediates interactions with several cellular proteins necessary for transcriptional activation and replication such as Brd4 , TaxBP1 , and GPS2/AMF-1 [6 , 9\u201311] . The E2 protein binds with high affinity to an inverted palindromic sequences present in all PVs , which serves to regulate viral transcription and replication [12] . E2 binds to and recruits E1 , an ATP dependent replicative helicase , to these E2-binding motifs [13] . Together with an adjacent E1 binding site and short polyA tract , these composite sequences define and function as the origin of replication ( ori ) [13 , 14] . Antibodies to BPV E1 and E2 have been used in ChIP experiments to document localization of E2 protein to this region in G1/S phase [15] , however , analogous reagents for the HPV protein counterparts have not been available . Assembly of E1 into double hexamers requires release from E2 , which has been reported to be a consequence of cyclin dependent kinase mediated phosphorylation of E1 [16 , 17] . Mutations in the viral E1 or E2 genes result in integration or loss of the viral genome [18] . Eukaryotic origin licensing encompasses a highly orchestrated series of precise steps that limits firing to once per cell cycle [19] . DNA synthesis begins when the seven-subunit origin recognition complex ( ORC ) assembles on DNA . In contrast to the ~30 base pair ( bp ) PV origin , the sequence requirements for metazoan replication origins definition are poorly defined , and these may span chromosomal regions of perhaps 100 , 000 kb [20\u201323] . Mammalian replication initiates at the predicted 104\u2013105 origins in a processive cascade that is coordinated by loading of the pre-replication complex ( pre-RC ) onto chromatin [24\u201326] . The experiments performed herein include chromosomal regions that are recognized to contain potential origins for comparisons to their PV counterparts operative in the same cell . The ORC1 protein is the only ORC member to contain a bromo-adjacent homology domain ( BAH ) necessary for interaction with DNA replication origins [27] . ORC1 is bound to DNA during G1 and released during S-phase and DNA synthesis , while ORC proteins 2\u20136 may be attached to DNA throughout the majority of cell cycle . ORC2 association with chromatin is regulated by cell cycle dependent phosphorylations at threonines 116 and 226 , which lead to its dissociation from chromatin during the transition from S to M while still in complex with the other ORC proteins [28] . After ORC binding to chromatin in late M through G1 , the multiple mini-chromosome maintenance complex ( Mcm2-7 ) DNA helicase is loaded onto chromatin following binding of Cdc6 to ORC . Very little is known of which host replication factors are required during each stage of the viral replicative program . We describe here that BPV and HPV E2 proteins bind to ORC2 , however , this pre-RC factor is not present at the viral replicon and its depletion did not suppress viral replication but instead increased the presence of E1 and E2 at the viral origin . This led to the hypothesis that E2 association with ORC2 regulates viral and cellular origin loading such that at low levels of E2 , its complex with ORC2 suppresses viral replication . When high levels of E2 are achieved in the differentiation dependent viral genome amplification stage , E2 restricts cellular origin recognition by ORC , which would otherwise complete for factors necessary for viral DNA synthesis . These results illustrate a novel mechanism by which PV E2 orchestrates the viral genome replication program in a stratifying epithelial environment . \n The current study began as we questioned whether ORC proteins assemble at the PV origin . While E1 and E2 proteins are sufficient to activate the PV ori , it is possible that a pre-ORC factor also participates in viral ori licensing . For example , the Epstein-Barr Virus ( EBV ) EBNA-1 protein binds to and recruits ORC2 to oriP [29] . This leads to entry of ORC2-4 along with the helicase component MCM2 [30] . E2 has structural and functional similarities to EBNA-1 [31 , 32] , however EBV does not utilize a viral DNA helicase that resembles E1 at oriP . We initiated this survey using immunoprecipitation of the BPV-1 E2 protein followed by immunoblotting for the pre-RC mammalian factors ORC1 and ORC2 . C33A cells were transfected with plasmids expressing BPV-1 E2 or the truncated E2R that lacks the 160 initial amino acids of the TAD [33] along with mouse FLAG-ORC1 or FLAG-ORC2 . Full length BPV-1 E2 but not E2R co-immunoprecipitated ORC2 protein but not ORC1 ( Fig 1A ) . Next we determined whether the TAD was sufficient for association with ORC2 . BPV-1 E2 full length , TAD , and E2R along with mouse ORC2 were expressed in C33A cells . Since full length BPV-1 E2 increases transcription of most co-transfected genes [34] , cells were treated with 10 \u03bcM MG132 for 6 hr except for those expressing full length E2 to achieve comparable ORC2 protein levels among all the experimental groups . Both E2 and its TAD individually co-immunoprecipitated ORC2 , whereas the E2R form did not ( Fig 1B ) . In analogous experiments , HA-tagged human ORC2 ( HA-hORC2 ) co-immunoprecipitated with FLAG-HPV-31 E2 ( Fig 1C ) but not with the HPV-31 E1 protein ( Fig 1D ) . The presence of HPV-31 E1 did not interfere with ORC2 pull down with HPV-31 E2 ( Fig 1D ) . To diminish the possibility that other mammalian factors bridge E2 to ORC2 , baculovirus lysates containing human ORC2 protein were combined with bacterially expressed 6-histidine tagged BPV-1 E2 TAD or control HPV-16 E6 proteins . Nickel bead collection of these his-tagged proteins showed that ORC2 specifically interacted with the E2 TAD ( Fig 1E ) , implying that in the absence of other mammalian replication factors , ORC2 may bind directly to E2 . Subsequently we confirmed the protein-protein interaction between E2 and ORC2 in vivo using in-situ proximity ligation assays ( PLA ) . As a positive control , we observed fluorescent puncta in cells transfected with FLAG-HPV-31 E2 and HA-HPV-31 E1 ( Fig 2B ) . C33A cells transfected with FLAG-HPV-31 E2 and HA-hORC2 showed fluorescent spots compared to untransfected cells ( Fig 2A ) , indicating association between two proteins in vivo . We also detected PLA interaction between FLAG-HPV-31 E2 and endogenous levels of ORC2 ( Fig 2C ) . Because E2 engages the viral ori , the expectation was that ORC2 would be present near the PV ori or the flanking sequences of the long control region ( LCR ) . After confirming that commercial ORC2 antibodies immunoprecipitate the native ORC2 protein using baculovirus expressed human ORC2 lysate ( Fig 3A ) , we performed a series of chromatin immunoprecipitation ( ChIP ) experiments using HPV-BP and CIN612-9E cells , which maintain low copy HPV-16 and HPV-31 episomes respectively . These cell lines , expressing E1 and E2 from native viral promoters , were synchronized to G1/S with double thymidine to capture putative ORC complexes at or near the PV ori . Repeated ChIP assays failed to detect endogenous ORC2 near the HPV-16 or HPV-31 LCR , while ORC2 was detectable near the mammalian origin of replication present within the GM-CSF gene ( Fig 3B and 3C ) . A 6 kb region upstream of the MCM4 upper regulatory region ( Exon 9 ) and the associated primers , previously reported to be free of ORC2 [35] , served as a negative control . Commercially available ORC2 antibodies do not have high affinity for mouse ORC2 , prohibiting analogous ChIP experiments in C127 cell lines that stably replicate BPV-1 episomes . Because ORC2 was not present near the viral ori , other regions within and flanking the LCR were probed for the presence of ORC2 and compared to antibodies directed against the viral E1 or E2 proteins as positive controls . ChIP was performed for HPV-31 E2 and ORC2 using lysates from CIN612-9E cells enriched in G1/S with double thymidine . In these experiments , we used an anti-peptide antibody to HPV-31 E2 ( epitope aa 97\u2013109; Fig 4A ) and HPV-16 E1 antibodies confirmed to cross-react with the highly conserved HPV-31 E1 protein ( Fig 4C ) . Target DNA immunoprecipitation with HPV-31 E2 was at least 15 fold greater than with negative control EE antibodies , while ORC2 could not be detected at these regions ( Fig 4B ) . HPV-31 E2 enrichment was greatest near the region of the E2 binding sites between the LCR2 and LCR4 primer sets . To perform analogous experiments with a second HPV genotype , we used W12 cells that contain HPV-16 episomes . Consistent with our previous results , these ChIP reactions demonstrated the presence of HPV-16 E1 at the LCR while ORC2 was not detected at this location in the HPV genome ( Fig 4D ) . Previous studies observed that E1 and E2 co-expression leads to formation of nuclear foci in CV-1 , C33A , and primary human foreskin keratinocyte ( HFK ) cells in the presence and/or absence of the HPV origin [8 , 36\u201338] . These are considered to be \u2018replication centers\u2019 where E2 and E1 assemble on viral genomes . Several DNA repair proteins have been shown to accumulate at these foci , including \u0263H2AX , pATM , pChk2 , NBS1 , and Rad51 [39 , 40] . While the ChIP data implied ORC2 does not directly participate in viral ori licensing , we questioned whether it was present at these nuclear foci . CV-1 cells were transfected with expression vectors for HPV-31 E1 , HPV-31 E2 , and YFP-ORC2 with or without an HPV-31 ori containing plasmid . HPV-31 E2 and YFP-ORC2 expression alone are both diffusely nuclear . YFP-ORC2 did not co-localize with E1 and E2 nuclear foci in the presence ( S1A\u2013S1C Fig ) or absence of the HPV-31 origin ( S1D\u2013S1F Fig ) . We also confirmed these observations using BPV E1 and E2 proteins , which were detected in discrete nuclear spots , while ORC2 was dispersed throughout the nucleus ( S2 Fig ) . This observation is consistent with our ORC2 co-IP data in which ORC2 interacted with E2 but E1 was not in this complex ( Fig 1D ) . Because ORC2 co-immunoprecipitated with E2 yet was not detectable at the viral ori or at viral replication foci , this inferred that ORC2 is not necessary for viral replicon licensing . To provide experimental evidence for this , we performed transient replication assays in which firefly luciferase activity is proportional to episomal copy number as corroborated by PCR for viral DNA content [41\u201345] . Further confirmation of this assay is sensitivity to DNA replication inhibitors [46] . For the analyses , we normalized firefly luciferase levels to co-transfected renilla levels to control for non-specific transcriptional effects . Due to relatively high levels of E1 and E2 protein expression , this experimental transient transfection model likely reflects the amplification stage of viral genome replication [47] . ORC2 depletion resulted in increased replication of the luciferase-linked HPV-31 ori plasmid driven by co-transfected E1 and E2 ( Fig 5A ) . ORC2 knockdown did not change luciferase levels when the ori was transfected with E1 or E2 alone ( S3A Fig ) . Using BPV-1 E1 and E2 with a luciferase-reporter ori plasmid , ORC2 knockdown increased BPV-1 replication though not to same extent as with HPV-31 ( S3B Fig ) . The non-specific transcriptional activity of BPV-1 E2 may contribute to its higher basal luciferase levels [48] . The ORC2 shRNA hairpin had no effect on luciferase activity with co-expression of replication incompetent E2R with BPV-1 E1 . We also investigated the consequences of ORC2 depletion on the HPV replication at endogenous E1 and E2 protein levels maintained in monolayer cultures by co-transfecting the ORC2 shRNA together with the HPV-31 ori reporter plasmid into CIN612 cell lines . These conditions represent the maintenance phase of the viral replication program . The reporter plasmid system was necessitated because direct measurement of viral copy number by quantitative PCR would include the large number of CIN612-9E cells that were not transfected with the shRNA . Consistent with our previous studies , ORC2 shRNA induced increased luciferase production and displayed a corresponding reduction of ORC2 protein ( S3C Fig ) . for comparison , we investigated the consequences of ORC2 depletion on the pREP4-EBNA1 , an EBV based episomal oriP plasmid containing the EF1\u03b1 promoter and luciferase reporter gene . Transfection of the ORC2 shRNA suppressed EBNA1 induced replication ( Fig 5B ) , consistent with the observation that EBV replication is ORC2 dependent [29] . As ORC2 shRNA knockdown had the opposite effect on luciferase levels with the EBV reporter compared to the HPV reporter , we concluded that the increased luciferase levels in the HPV system was not due to a direct effect of ORC2 shRNA on luciferase protein expression but reflective of PV copy number . In more efficiently transfected HPV-BP cells , knockdown of ORC2 showed a ten fold increase in HPV-16 DNA episome number measured by quantitative PCR with primers specific to the HPV-16 LCR ( Fig 5C and 5D ) . In contrast , ORC2 knockdown did not produce a significant change in HPV-16 DNA content in SiHa cells , which contain a single integrated copy of the HPV-16 genome . While it might be argued that ORC2 knockdown might change luciferase mRNA expression or stability , these experiments demonstrated the same effects on cells with endogenous HPV genomes . The decrement in ORC2 protein levels following ORC2 shRNA was relatively small , as we assumed that a dramatic reduction in ORC2 levels would be detrimental to cell proliferation . Nonetheless , an ORC2 siRNA duplex was obtained to attempt more effective reduce the ORC2 expression in CIN612-9E cells . The ORC2 siRNA caused a more dramatic reduction of ORC2 levels compared to the previously used ORC2 shRNA at 48 h ( Fig 6A ) . ORC2 silencing had no effect on the cell cycle profile at 48 h ( S4A Fig ) . We then tested the consequences of ORC2 depletion on HPV-31 replication in a model of replication maintenance . First , CIN612 cells were transfected with the HPV-31 ori reporter plasmid in the absence or presence of ORC2 siRNA . As seen in Fig 6B , ORC2 depletion enhanced luciferase levels at 48h . In the following series of experiments , we evaluated the effects of ORC2 depletion on viral replication during keratinocyte differentiation [49 , 50] . CIN612 cells expressing endogenous levels of HPV-31 E1 and E2 were transfected with the HPV-31 ori reporter plasmid . To induce differentiation , cells were placed in 10% FBS DMEM + 2 mM CaCl2 for 48 h . Levels of the differentiation marker involucrin protein were elevated after calcium treatment ( Fig 6C ) . As shown in Fig 6D , luciferase expression increased approximately 1 . 5 fold during differentiation , which is consistent with previous studies using Southern blotting to measure copy number at 48 h in CIN612-9E cells [40 , 51] . Subsequently , control and ORC2 siRNAs were transfected into CIN612 cells along with the HPV-31 ori reporter plasmid in the presence or absence of 48 h calcium and normalized to renilla levels . Consistent with the shRNA experiments , ORC2 silencing enhanced HPV-31 ori luciferase expression ( Fig 6E ) . Finally , we measured HPV-31 DNA genome levels in CIN612 cells after ORC2 depletion and calcium induced differentiation . HPV-31 DNA content was significantly higher with ORC2 knockdown compared to the control at 72 h ( Fig 6F ) . Consistently , the ORC2 depleted cells showed increased HPV-31 E2 and E1 occupancy near two of the three viral origin regions tested by ChIP assay ( Fig 7 ) . Taken together , these results implied that ORC2 is not necessary for HPV ori licensing , so the logical question became what is the biological significance of E2 binding to ORC2 . A clue is that high level expression of the HPV E2 protein has been reported to inhibit cellular proliferation [52 , 53] . This led us to hypothesize that E2 association might interfere with ORC2 function . To test this , we queried the effects of E2 expression on ORC2 occupancy at a frequently utilized mammalian origin . These ChIP experiments are challenging since it is well established that origin utilization is variable in both site usage and timing [54 , 55] and because of the magnitude and repetitive composition of the human genome [56] . These experiments included U2OS T-REx cells with a doxycycline-inducible HPV-31 E2 expression cassette ( i31E2 ) and U2OS cells that stably express the HPV-16 E2 protein ( 16E2 ) . ORC2 protein levels were unaltered in the presence of E2 ( Fig 8A ) . It was reported that HPV-16 E2 expressing U2OS cells are capable of progression into and through S-phase although this occurs at a slower rate [57] . We analyzed the cell cycle between the E2 expressing cell lines and their controls and found no difference between their cell cycle profiles ( S4B Fig ) . U2OS , 16E2 , and i31E2 cells were enriched in G1/S phase content and ChIP assays were performed with ORC2 and control antibodies . Occupation of ORC2 at the GM-CSF origin was reduced in cells expressing HPV-31 E2 and HPV-16 E2 ( Fig 8B ) . The presence of ORC2 on the lamin B2 origin [35] was also decreased in i31E2 cells following dox-induced HPV-31 E2 expression ( Fig 8C ) . \n For the timely and efficient duplication of an entire metazoan genome , DNA synthesis must begin at an estimated 10\u2013100 , 000 replication origins that must be activated once and only once per cell cycle [20] . Ori firing is coordinated by ORC binding followed by a cascade in which the MCM2-7 hexamer , Cdc6 , and Cdt1 assemble during G1 and become activated by protein kinases during S-phase [58] . While metazoan origins span tens of thousands of kilobases , small viral genomes cannot accommodate such vast sequences . Furthermore , papillomaviruses do not encode any DNA polymerases and yet persistently infect and autonomously replicate their genomes in host cells . Functionally , the PV origin consists of recognition sites for the high affinity and high specificity E2 protein , a contiguous binding site for E1 , and a flanking A-rich tract . Upon entry of a single papillomavirus genome into a basal epithelial cell nucleus , it undergoes replication to a few copies . The viral E1 and E2 proteins are not present in the virion , so viral transcription with accompanying synthesis of these proteins is assumed to occur very early after infection . A recent study found that replication begins at the viral ori and proceeds through a theta structure model , although subsequent replication appeared to be unidirectional and did not initiate at a specific site [59] . Viral copy number is maintained in proliferating basal keratinocytes and in vitro cultured cells that carry PV episomes , which presumably requires viral origin licensing during G1/S after which the replicated genomes partition without triggering the mitotic spindle dependent checkpoint [60] . Viral genome segregation involves E2 interaction with Brd4 and ChlR1 [6 , 61 , 62] . The genome amplification stage occurs in response to an unknown differentiation associated cue . Activation of the ATM/ATR DNA damage pathway has been shown to stimulate viral genome amplification [2 , 36] but is not necessary for episome maintenance [63] . TopBP1 , a protein involved in the DNA damage response pathway , is essential for initiation of viral replication and may play a crucial role for genome amplification [64 , 65] . Our goal is to characterize the cellular replication factors that are necessary for each stage of the PV tri-phasic replicative program . In experiments to investigate involvement of ORC factors in PV replication , we discovered that ORC2 co-immunoprecipitates with BPV-1 and HPV-31 E2 . The E2 protein regulates viral transcription by interacting with cellular factors and targeting these to the viral genome via its C-terminal DNA binding domain [8] . Its N-terminal trans-activation domain ( TAD ) was sufficient for ORC2 association . We were able to detect by ChIP endogenous levels of HPV-31 E2 and HPV-16 and -31 E1 proteins at the viral ori using a cell line that stabily maintains HPV episomes . Unexpectedly , ORC2 was not present at the HPV origin region in these cells under conditions where ORC2 was detectable at a commonly utilized cellular origin . It seems unlikely these antibodies might not access the ORC2 complex at the viral DNA . These data inferred that ORC2 is not necessary for viral origin licensing . Consistent with this observation , YFP-tagged ORC2 protein was not visualized at E1 and E2 nuclear replication foci but instead appeared diffusely throughout the nucleus . However , we cannot exclude the possibility that the ORC2 epitope is not available or that a few molecules of ORC2 protein are present in these foci . An RNAi ORC2 knockdown strategy was pursued with the goal of reducing but not eliminating this key pre-RC factor . ORC2 depletion increased viral copy number in transient replication assays and in keratinocytes that maintain episomal HPV-16 genomes relative to genomic DNA content . ORC2 depletion had no effect on HPV content in SiHa cells with an integrated HPV-16 genome . Consistently , ORC2 knockdown increased HPV-31 DNA content in HPV-31 episomal cell lines . In experiments in which ORC2 expression vectors were co-transfected along with a PV-replicon reporter or E2 vector , the cells were unable to be established , indicating that over-expression of ORC2 is deleterious for cell proliferation , and hence effects on viral replication could not be studied . We found that short term ORC2 knockdown did not alter the cell cycle prolife , implying sufficient levels of ORC2 are present to sustain growth . Previous reports have found depletion of ORC2 has different outcomes on the cell cycle dependent on cell type . For example , ORC2 siRNA decreased S-phase DNA content in MCF10A breast cancer cells [66] . In HeLa cells , ORC2 depletion showed a slower S-phase and an increased M-phase [67] . However in HCT116 with a hypomorphic ORC2 mutation that expressed 10% of ORC2 compared to wild-type replicated normally once is S-phase [68] . There is evidence for post-translation modifications of ORC2 , which may regulate ori licensing [28] . Utilization of re-replication ( pre-RC ) proteins has been discovered with several large DNA viruses including two gamma herpesviruses . EBV genomes utilize the mammalian replication licensing mechanism for conservation of viral copy number in latently infected cells . EBNA1 binds to and recruits ORC2 to the EBV oriP [29 , 30] . Consistent with its role in EBNA1 regulated EBV replication , our ORC2 knockdown experiments disclosed a comparative decrease in EBNA-induced transient replication . ORC2 was reported to bind to Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus ( KSHV , HHV-8 ) terminal repeats where LANA dependent replication initiates [69] . Depletion of ORC2 was reported to decrease KSHV latent replication [69] . In contrast and similar to our observations , reduced levels of ORC2 increased lytic replication of beta herpesvirus human cytomegalovirus ( HCMV , HHV-5 ) [70] , which conceptually resembles PV amplification that occurs in differentiated epithelial cells . We conclude that PV ori licensing does not require ORC2 . The data shown here indicate that ORC2 suppresses PV genome replication during its maintenance phase . Levels of the E2 protein are very low in the maintenance phase of the viral life cycle such that the ORC2 protein may interfere with E2 loading at the viral origin . Increased viral replication following ORC2 depletion is likely due to the increased occupancy of E1 and E2 detected at the viral origin . The ratio of ORC2 to E2 changes during the viral amplification stage , which resemble a G2/M arrest state imposed by high levels of the HPV E4 protein in the upper epithelium [71 , 72] . While this has been proposed to allow for continued viral DNA synthesis in the absence of cell cycle progression , tens of thousands of human origins persist and might be licensed and activated . Our hypothesis is that the high levels of E2 that occur in differentiated epithelial strata [49 , 50] inhibit ORC2 function and thereby restrict firing of host replicative origins that would otherwise effectively compete for replication enzymes necessary for viral genome amplification . Several studies have shown that over-expression of E2 induces growth arrest in both HPV positive and negative cell lines [47 , 53 , 73\u201375] . The E2-mediated growth arrest in HPV positive cells is mediated through expression of E6 and E7 [76] , but the mechanism in HPV negative cells is unclear . In HaCat cells , over-expression of HPV-16 E2 induced apoptotic cell death , however , surviving cells maintained long-term low expression of E2 and appeared to be terminally differentiated [77] . Primary human foreskin keratinocytes infected with HPV-31 E2 adenovirus arrested in S-phase [52] . Inducible expression of HPV-31 E2 protein in U2OS cells resulted in reduced ORC2 bound at the GM-CSF ori . The cell cycle profile in the cell lines with E2 over-expression did not change suggesting that reduced ORC2 bound at the origin was not due to cell death . These experiments illustrate the dual nature of the E2-ORC2 interaction and how the virus senses and manipulates its cellular environment . At low levels of E2 present in basal cells , ORC2 inhibits viral replication and thereby prevents a lytic infection . During epithelial differentiation when elevated levels of E2 are achieved , its complex with ORC2 restricts host cell origin licensing thus promoting replication of the HPV amplicon . \n Codon optimized FLAG HPV-31 E2 [36] was cloned between the BamHI and HindIII sites of pcDNA3 . Codon optimized triple FLAG HPV-31 E1 [41] , pCG-BPV-1 E1 Eag123 [78] , the ori-luciferase plasmids for the PV transient replication assay [41] , pLKO . 1 ORC2 shRNA [64] , YFP-ORC2 [40] used were previously reported . For shRNA experiments , pCMV-GIN-Zeo ( Open Biosystems ) was used as the control plasmid . Human ORC2 cDNA was cloned between the NheI and ApaI sites in pcDNA3 containing a HA tag . Mouse ORC1 and ORC2 cDNA were amplified by PCR from mouse cDNA with FLAG tags and cloned into the MluI and SalI sites of the pCI backbone . The BPV-1 expression vectors and GST vectors have been described elsewhere [10 , 79] . pREP4 which contains the EBV oriP and EBNA1 was modified to contain a E1F-\u03b1 minimal promoter and used to measure EBV replication . To generate inducible HPV-31 expression , codon optimized FLAG HPV-31 E2 was cloned into the HindIII and ApaI sites of pcDNA4/TO-luc creating pcDNA4/TO-FLAG 31 E2 . The following antibodies were used: Mouse anti-FLAG ( M2; Sigma ) , mouse anti-HA ( HA-7; Sigma 3F10; Roche , 12CA5 ) , mouse anti-human ORC2 ( MBL ) , rat anti-human ORC2 ( Cell Signaling ) , mouse anti-HPV-16 E6 ( Arbor Vita ) , mouse anti-EE and anti-\u03b2-actin ( Sigma ) . BPV-1 E2 was identified with B201 ( a mouse monoclonal antibody with an epitope between amino acids 160\u2013220 ) and II-1 rabbit antisera [12] . The sheep anti-HPV-16 E2 antibody was described elsewhere [62] . With the prior approval of the Johns Hopkins University Animal Care and Use committee ( protocol RA14M47 ) , two Lewis rats were immunized three times with 50 \u03bcg of GST-tagged E1 N terminal fusion protein ( GST-E1N ) ; ( 1\u2013209 amino acids of HPV16 E1 protein ) formulated with TiterMax ( TiterMax USA , Inc . ) adjuvant and the fourth immunization only GST-E1N was used . Three days following the final immunization , splenocytes were harvested , pooled and fused with SP2/0 myeloma cells using polyethylene glycol ( PEG ) . Supernatants from wells containing viable hybridomas were screened at 10 to 14 days after fusion by ELISA using bacterially expressed GST-E1N and GST-tagged E2 ( GST-E2 ) derived from HPV16 as a coating antigen . Selected positive clones that recognized GST-E1N but not GST-E2 were re-cloned three times by limiting dilution ( 1H4-4E-32 . 7 . 3 . 1 and 11B63G . 6 . 1 ) , and the antibodies secreted were purified using protein G Sepharose ( GE Healthcare ) . An 18mer peptide array of E1 peptides within the 1\u2013206 regions of HPV16 , each overlapping by 15 residues was utilized to map the MAb epitopes by direct ELISA . Diluted hybridoma supernatants or purified antibodies were added to the blocked peptide-coated plates and incubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C . Plates were washed three times with PBS containing Tween-20 again and then incubated with HRP conjugated goat anti-rat IgG for 60 min at 37\u00b0C . Unbound MAb was then washed away with 0 . 01% Tween 20 in PBS and signal detected with ABTS ( Roche , Basel Switzerland ) . Anti-E1 MAb , 1H4-4E-32 . 7 . 3 . 1 isotype IgG2a , recognized only two overlapping E1 peptides comprising residues 4\u201321 and 7\u201324 , its epitope likely within in 7\u201321 ( TNGEEGTGCNGWFYV ) . Another anti-E1 Mab of isotype IgG2a , 11B63G . 6 . 1 , recognized 5 overlapping E1 peptides ( 4\u201321 , 7\u201324 , 10\u201327 , 13\u201330 and 16\u201333 ) and , its epitope likely resides within residues 16\u201321 ( NGWFYV ) .

The World Health Organization classifies brucellosis as a neglected zoonotic disease that is rarely in the spotlight for research and mainly affects poor , marginalized people . Urban and peri-urban farming is a common practice in many low-income countries , and it increases the incomes of families that are often restrained by limited economic resources . However , there is a concern that the growing number of people and livestock living close together in these areas will increase the transmission of zoonotic pathogens such as Brucella . This study investigates the presence of Brucella DNA in bovine milk in the urban and peri-urban area of Dushanbe , Tajikistan . Brucella DNA was detected in 10 . 3% of 564 cow milk samples by IS711-based real-time PCR . This finding is concerning because consumption of unpasteurized dairy products is common in the region . Furthermore , Brucella DNA was detected in the milk of all seropositive cows , but 8 . 3% of the seronegative cows also showed the presence of Brucella DNA . In addition , sequence analysis of the rpoB gene suggests that one cow was infected with B . abortus and another cow was most likely infected with B . melitensis . The discrepancies between the serology and real-time PCR results highlight the need to further investigate whether there is a need for implementing complementary diagnostic strategies to detect false serological negative individuals in Brucella surveillance , control , and eradication programmes . Furthermore , vaccination of cattle with S19 in addition to vaccination of small ruminants with Rev 1 might be needed in order to control Brucella infections in the livestock population but further research focusing on the isolation of Brucella is required to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the Brucella spp . circulating among the livestock in this region . \n Brucellosis is considered to be one of the most common zoonotic infections worldwide with major public health implications [1] , but it is still classified as one of seven neglected zoonotic diseases by the World Health Organization ( WHO ) [2] . The global incidence of human brucellosis is estimated to exceed 800 , 000 cases per year , of which 40% are estimated to result in a chronic infection [3] . Central Asia and the Middle East are areas with high incidence rates among humans and livestock . Deregulations of trade and decreased border controls following political changes in post-communist countries are believed to be one set of explanations as to why Central Asia is currently a hotspot for brucellosis [4] . One of the most powerful megatrends of our time , in Asia as well as globally , is urbanization [5] , but an often forgotten consequence of human urbanization is the urbanization of their livestock [6] . Urban and peri-urban ( UPU ) livestock production contributes to the supply of fresh food and income for families that are often restrained by limited economic resources [7] . However , there is a concern that the growing number of people and livestock living close together in UPU areas will increase the transmission of different zoonotic pathogens such as Brucella [6] . Small-scale UPU farming is a common practice in many low-income countries and in Tajikistan approximately 80% of the population is represented by small-scale livestock farmers [8] . There are currently 12 different species described within the genus Brucella [9 , 10] . The species mainly concerning livestock and their principal farm animal hosts are Brucella abortus ( cattle ) , B . melitensis ( sheep and goats ) , and B . suis ( swine ) , and all have a zoonotic potential except for B . suis biovar 2 [11] . Disease transmission to humans most commonly occurs after direct contact with an infected animal or through consumption of unpasteurized dairy products [12] . If acute human brucellosis is not treated with adequate antibiotics , the infection can turn into a chronic disease and lead to permanent disability [13] . The disease in livestock mainly affects the reproductive organs and the udder and retromammary lymph nodes are often permanently infected in cows [12] . Frequent shedding of Brucella into the milk constitutes a risk for the consumers of unpasteurized dairy products . Serology is widely used in surveillance and control programmes for brucellosis , but serological assays can give false-positive [14] , or false-negative [15\u201317] , results . Furthermore , serology tests do not reveal which Brucella spp . is causing infection in the host , and this precludes the possibility of identifying the infection source which is important to know when planning and implementing appropriate control measures [18] . Bio-safety level 3 laboratories are recommended for cultural growth of all zoonotic Brucella spp . that infect livestock due to the very low infectious dose [19\u201320] . In many low-income countries , there are few or no bio-safety level 3 laboratories available . Genetic characterization using molecular DNA technology allows molecular typing of Brucella without having to handle living Brucella organisms [21] . The quantitative or real-time polymerase chain reaction ( qPCR ) assay targeting the insertion element IS711 is specific and highly sensitive and could be an appropriate method for the rapid and safe detection of the genus Brucella [22] . Further classification of Brucella at the species level can be performed by qPCR targeting the rpoB gene [23] . The objectives of the current study in the UPU area of Dushanbe , Tajikistan , were to investigate the presence of Brucella DNA in bovine milk with qPCR , to perform sequence analysis of Brucella DNA extracted from bovine milk , and to investigate how the qPCR result corresponds to previously obtained serology data . \n Samples were collected in compliance with EU legislation on research involving animals [24] , and the animals were treated according to the ethical standards of Tajik Agrarian University . The study protocol that included non-invasive collection of milk samples by traditional hand-stripping was approved by the \u201cEthic committee of the Tajik Agrarian University\u201d ( Dushanbe , Tajikistan ) . The farmers were informed about the purpose and methods of the study and that participation was on a voluntary basis . Informed verbal consent was obtained from all participants and documented together with the coordinates of each herd . All data was handled anonymously and no data regarding the identity of individual animals or farmers were collected . This set-up was important because the farmers would not receive any financial compensation if a cow was found to be Brucella spp . -positive and thus at risk of being culled . Therefore , collecting personal data would risk many farmers to refuse to participate in the study . The study area and study population have been described in detail previously [25] . In brief , the current study was conducted in the UPU areas of Dushanbe , the capital city of Tajikistan , with a radius of <20 km from the central part of the city ( Fig 1 ) . There are approximately 800 , 000 people living in Dushanbe [26] and the UPU area is dominated by small-scale farming with approximately 45 , 000 dairy cows in the study area . The villages within the UPU areas practice either communal grazing on natural rangelands or keep their animals tethered or at limited pastures . Rearing sheep and goats together with cattle is common practice in the peri-urban areas where the villages have access to natural rangelands . The predominant dairy cow is a local breed with an estimated average annual milk production of 3 , 000 liters . This study was carried out simultaneously with a seroprevalence study among dairy cows where the selection of villages , herds and individuals has been described previously in detail [25] . In brief , information of the villages keeping dairy cows with a radius of < 20 km from the central part of Dushanbe was received from the local official veterinarians and the villages were numbered and selected randomly . In each village , as many herds as possible with dairy cows were sampled . In each herd the aim was to sample all lactating cows . The seroprevalence study included 904 cows in 443 herds , and among these milk samples were collected from 570 cows in 329 herds . Thus the current report comprise 570 cows with serological data . In the current study , approximately 2 mL of milk was collected from each cow into Eppendorf tubes and kept cold during transport to the laboratory at the Tajik Agrarian University in Dushanbe . In the seroprevalence study , serum samples were tested for Brucella-specific antibodies with indirect enzyme-linked-immunosorbent assay ( I-ELISA ) , and positive samples were confirmed with competitive ELISA ( C-ELISA ) . None of the cattle in the study had been vaccinated against brucellosis according to information from the local official veterinarians . A GPS ( Global Positioning System ) receiver was used to record coordinates ( latitude/longitude ) of the herds . The milk was inactivated at 56\u00b0C for 30 min and then stored at -20\u00b0C until transport to the Zoonosis Science Center at Uppsala University , Sweden . The molecular analyses were performed at the Zoonosis Science Center at Uppsala University , Sweden , and at the Veterinary and Agrochemical Research Center in Brussels , Belgium . Bacterial DNA was extracted from the milk samples using phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol ( Sigma-Aldrich , Saint Louis , Missouri , US ) according to a protocol for extraction of bacterial DNA from milk and cream recommended by the Brucella reference laboratory at the Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency ( AHVLA ) ( Weybridge , UK ) . Milk samples were randomly chosen for extraction in sets of 24 to avoid cross-contamination between samples and the DNA extracts were stored at -20\u00b0C . The milk extracts were analysed for inhibition and presence of bacterial DNA according to a protocol by Corless et al . [27] with universal primers and probe ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , Massachusetts , US ) targeting the bacterial 16S-gene , with the minor modification of reducing the template volume to 1 \u03bcL . Samples were evaluated as positive when the cycle threshold ( Ct ) value was less than the negative control . The baseline was set using the normalization method: dynamic tube normalization ( default setting/auto-baseline ) in the Rotor-Gene software 2 . 1 . 0 . 9 , while the threshold was set manually at 0 . 020 . The expected amplicon length was 111 base pairs ( bp ) . DNA from the bacterial strain T2378 of Treponema sp . and Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain B683 , were used as positive controls in the 16S rRNA qPCR assay , and sterile water was used as negative control . The Brucella genus-specific insertion element IS711 was targeted during screening of Brucella spp . The primer-probe set came from Matero et al . [28] . In brief , the IS711 amplification reactions contained: 2 \u03bcL DNA template , 2 . 5 U AmpliTaq Gold DNA polymerase ( Applied Biosystems , Foster City , California , US ) , 1X ( 5 \u03bcL of 10X ) GeneAmp buffer II , 6 mM MgCl2 , 800 \u03bcM GeneAmp dNTP blend ( Applied Biosystems , California , United States ) , 300 nM of each primer ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , Massachusetts , US ) , 250 nM probe ( Life Technologies , Carlsbad , California , US ) , and sterile water . The final reaction volume was 50 \u03bcL , and the amplification profile was as follows: a hot-start step at 95\u00b0C for 10 min followed by 45 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 15 s and 60\u00b0C for 60 s . The expected amplicon length was 53 bp . A sample was considered to be positive if the cycle threshold ( Ct ) \u2264 38 . All samples were analysed twice and a sample was considered to be Brucella spp . -positive if the qPCR showed positive test results in both runs . The baseline was set using the auto-baseline ( normalization method: dynamic tube normalization ) in the Rotor-Gene software 2 . 1 . 0 . 9 , while the threshold for the IS711-assay was set manually at 0 . 055 . In all assays , two positive controls consisting of DNA of the reference strain B . suis biovar 1 from the commercial INgene Bruce-ladder V kit , Ingenasa , Madrid , Spain were included . A negative control containing sterile water and a no-template control were included in all qPCR runs . Additionally , an internal inhibition/amplification control containing master mix , one part randomly chosen extract and one part positive control was included in each run . Inhibition of the IS711 assay in the cow milk matrix was analysed by diluting extracts that gave no signal in the 16S assay , got Ct-values higher than the negative control in the 16S assay , and/or had a Ct-value around 40 in the IS711 assay , 10 and 100 fold in sterile water . Amplification and fluorescence measurements were performed on a Rotor-Gene 6000 qPCR machine ( Corbett Research , Mortlake , Australia ) . The efficiency and the sensitivity of the IS711 qPCR assay were evaluated using two 10 fold serial dilutions of the positive control , prepared in sterile water and a PCR-negative pool of milk extracts . The DNA concentrations , decided by NanoDrop 2000c Spectrophotometer ( Thermo Scientific , Wilmington , Delaware , USA ) , tested were: 2 . 90 ng \u03bcL-1 , 290 pg \u03bcL-1 , 29 . 0 pg \u03bcL-1 , 2 . 90 pg \u03bcL-1 , and 290 fg \u03bcL-1 . It has been suggested that it would be possible to identify isolates at the species and possibly biovar level by sequencing the rpoB gene of an unidentified Brucella isolate/DNA and querying a database such as GenBank [23] . Single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) have been documented at 22 positions in the 4093 bp sequences of classical Brucella species . A tentative identification of the Brucella species present in milk samples was performed on the extracted DNA . We designed 2 sets of primers ( Primer design tool Primer-BLAST , https://www . ncbi . nlm . nih . gov/tools/primer-blast/ ) to amplifying regions including SNP 716 , 737 , 969 and 985 . Set of primers 1: rpoB1983F: AAGCAGCTTGTTTCGGTTGC/rpoB2193R: GACCTGATCGACGATACCG Set of primers 2: rpoB2722F: TTCGGTGAAAAGGCATCCGA/rpoB3119R: AGCAGCTTCTTGGAGTCGTC The first set of primers ( rpob1983F/rpob2193R ) allows the amplification of a fragment of 210 bp that includes SNPs at positions 716 and 737 while the second set of primers ( rpoB2722F/ rpoB3119R ) allows the amplification of a fragment of 397 bp that includes SNPs at positions 969 and 985 . PCR amplifications were carried out using Icylcer Bio-rad PCR System ( Bio-rad , Temse , Belgium ) , following the Taq Polymerase manufacturer\u2019s suggested protocol ( TermoFisher , Gent , Belgium ) for reaction . Amplifications were initiated by denaturing the sample for 2 min at 94\u00b0C , followed by 40 cycles at 94\u00b0C for 45 s , 55\u00b0C for 30 s , and 72\u00b0C for 45 s . After the last cycle , samples were incubated for an additional 10 min at 72\u00b0C before they were stored at 4\u00b0C . Ten microlitres of each reaction mixture were analysed by electrophoresis through a 1% agarose gel with ethidium bromide . Custom DNA sequencing was performed by Macrogen DNA Sequencing Service , Amsterdam , the Netherlands . Sequences were pairwise aligned and compared to the previously determined rpoB sequence of B . abortus strain 2308 using programs provided by the National Center for Biotechnology Information ( www . ncbi . nlm . nih . gov ) . B . abortus strain 2308 accession number AY562179 \n In total , 570 cow milk samples were collected . DNA could not be extracted from two samples , resulting in 568 DNA extracts . Four additional milk samples were excluded from the study due to low amounts of extract . Consequently , 564 cow milk extracts from 326 herds in 21 villages were analysed for the presence of Brucella DNA . GPS coordinates were recorded for all but two herds ( n = 324 ) ( Fig 1 ) ( Arc Map 10 . 4 . 1 , ArcGIS software by Esri , www . esri . com ) . In total , bacterial DNA was present in 88% ( n = 486 ) of the extracts analysed with the 16S assay . Twelve samples had to be excluded from the 16S assay due to low amount of extract . Brucella DNA was detected in 10 . 3% ( n = 58 ) of the milk samples with IS711 qPCR . The internal inhibition/amplification control was positive in each assay . The apparent individual seroprevalence measured previously with I-ELISA and C-ELISA was 2 . 1% [25] . All seropositive cows ( n = 12 ) were also positive in the IS711 qPCR with Ct-values ranging between 26 . 9 and 31 . 9 . Out of the 552 seronegative cows , 8 . 3% ( n = 46 ) were Brucella positive by IS711 qPCR with Ct-values ranging between 26 . 5 and 38 . 0 ( Fig 2 ) . At herd level , 16% ( n = 52 ) of the herds had at least one positive cow based on IS711 qPCR ( Fig 1 ) . In total , 14 . 9% ( n = 84 ) of the extracts showed signs of inhibition in the 16S or in the IS711 assay . After dilution , only nine DNA extracts proved to contain PCR inhibitors affecting the IS711 qPCR assay . The efficiency of the IS711 qPCR assay was >99% ( R2 = 0 . 999 ) in sterile water , 91% ( R2 = 0 . 996 ) in undiluted cow milk matrix , and 96% ( R2 = 0 . 999 ) in 10 fold diluted milk matrix . The IS711 qPCR detected the lowest concentration of B . suis DNA tested in this study , 290 fg \u03bcL-1 in water , undiluted milk , and diluted milk . Fourteen samples , with Ct-values ranging between 26 . 5 and 30 . 6 , were selected for further analysis to species level but only two samples had sufficient amounts of DNA to perform sequence analysis . The first sample was collected from a seropositive cow , and the SNP allelic profiles corresponded to the profiles described for B . melitensis and B . suis at codon positions 716 and 737 [23] ( Table 1 ) ( S1 File ) . The other sample came from a seronegative cow , and the SNP allelic profiles corresponded to B . abortus at codon positions 716 , 969 , and 985 . At codon position 737 , which has previously been reported to be GTC for B . abortus ( 23 ) , the SNP was not described for B . abortus . See Table 1 for accession numbers of sequences deposited in GenBank ( www . ncbi . nlm . nih . gov/genbank/ ) . \n This study shows that Brucella DNA was commonly detected in bovine milk in the UPU area of Dushanbe , both among Brucella seropositive and seronegative individuals . DNA sequence analysis suggests that one cow was infected with B . abortus and that another cow most likely was infected with B . melitensis . In total , 10 . 3% of the cows had Brucella DNA in their milk as measured by IS711-based qPCR . The corresponding figures among the seropositive and seronegative cows were 100% and 8 . 3% , respectively . A similar discrepancy between the serology and qPCR results was demonstrated in a study from Switzerland comparing IS711-based qPCR , serology , and culture among wild boars in which Brucella DNA was detected in tissue samples of 11 . 1% of the seronegative individuals [29] . The discrepancy between the serology and qPCR results observed in the current study might indicate that the true number of Brucella-infected cattle within the study area is underestimated by serology screening . Serological false negative results have been reported as a consequence of reduced antibody titers over time . Hence , seronegative animals in the current study that tested positive by IS711-based qPCR might have been previously exposed to Brucella and then turned seronegative after a certain time period [30] . Another factor that might influence the result is sampling at an early stage of the infection , i . e . within the first 14 days , when the humoral immune response has not yet produced detectable levels of antibodies in the host [31] . Furthermore , individuals infected in utero or in the early post-natal period can become latently infected and thus never become serologically positive [12] , and approximately 3 . 5% of infected cows are estimated to deliver latent infected offspring [32] . It has also previously been reported that B . suis infection in cattle generates a shorter duration of antibody response in the host [15] . Whether this is also true for B . melitensis infection in cattle is not yet known and needs to be investigated further . If this is the case , it might partially explain the discrepancy between the serology and qPCR results observed in the current study . Another plausible explanation for the discrepancy between the serology and qPCR results might be previous vaccination against brucellosis [33] . However , in this study , the information given from the local official veterinarians that none of the cattle had been vaccinated against brucellosis is considered reliable because there is no national control programme for brucellosis among livestock in Tajikistan . The results from the sequence analysis of the rpoB gene suggests that B . abortus was present in the milk of one dairy cow . The analysis also revealed an SNP for B . abortus that has not previously been described , but whether this SNP is a new marker for B . abortus in the region remains unclear and more research is required to draw firm conclusions . Analysis of the other sample showed SNPs compatible with both B . melitensis and B . suis; however , because pig production is almost non-existent in Tajikistan , it is highly likely that this cow was infected with B . melitensis . This cow was not being kept together with small ruminants at the time of sampling , and the source of infection in this particular case remains unknown . The prevailing epidemiological situation in the study area , with endemic B . melitensis infection among sheep and goats [34] and where cattle are often kept in close proximity with small ruminants , suggests a spillover of B . melitensis from small ruminants to cattle which has also been demonstrated in a study from the neighboring country of Kyrgyzstan where B . melitensis has been isolated from cattle [35] . In the current study , only two samples yielded a sufficient amount of DNA to perform sequence analysis . Thus further research , including isolation of Brucella spp . from cattle , sheep , and goats , is required in order to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the Brucella spp . circulating within the livestock population in this region . Drawing firm conclusions regarding the zoonotic risk of consuming the milk from the qPCR- positive cows is difficult because qPCR can detect DNA from live , damaged or dead bacteria . However , because consumption and trading of unpasteurized dairy products is common among small-scale farmers in the UPU area of Dushanbe [36] , the significant numbers of cows with detectable levels of Brucella DNA in their milk might constitute a serious health concern . The IS711-based qPCR is very sensitive with a detection limit of 10 copies [37] , and potential bias in the current study might have arisen due to DNA contamination , either during sample collection or in the laboratory . During the sample collection , gloves were used as a protective measure and were changed between samplings at each household . The extraction of DNA from milk and the IS711-based qPCR was conducted in a laboratory where little work on Brucella had been conducted , and thus the risk of Brucella contamination within the laboratory was low . With the measures taken , we believe that we have minimized the risk of contamination and consider the results presented in the current study to be representative for the study population . \n This study shows widespread occurrence of Brucella DNA in bovine milk in the UPU area of Dushanbe . Furthermore , our results suggest that one cow was infected with B . abortus and another cow was most likely infected with B . melitensis . Thus , vaccination of cattle with S19 in addition to vaccination of small ruminants with Rev 1 might be needed in order to control Brucella infections in the livestock population but further research focusing on the isolation of Brucella is required to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the Brucella spp . circulating among the livestock in this region . The discrepancies between the serology and qPCR results , i . e . the potentially significant number of false serological negative individuals in the current study , highlights the need to further investigate whether there is a need for implementing complementary diagnostic strategies to detect false serological negative individuals in Brucella surveillance , control , and eradication programmes .", "headings": ["Abstract", "Introduction", "Materials and methods", "Results", "Discussion", "Conclusions"], "keywords": ["livestock", "medicine and health sciences", "pathology and laboratory medicine", "ruminants", "pathogens", "tropical diseases", "microbiology", "vertebrates", "animals", "brucellosis", "mammals", "bacterial diseases", "neglected tropical diseases", "bacteria", "extraction techniques", "bacterial pathogens", "research and analysis methods", "sequence analysis", "infectious diseases", "zoonoses", "serology", "bioinformatics", "medical microbiology", "brucella", "microbial pathogens", "agriculture", "dna extraction", "dna sequence analysis", "database and informatics methods", "biology and life sciences", "cattle", "amniotes", "bovines", "organisms"], "id": "journal.pntd.0005367"}
{"lay_summary": "Genome and chromosome stability are essential to maintain normal cell function and viability . However , differences in genome and chromosome structure are frequently found in organisms that undergo rapid adaptation to changing environmental conditions , and in humans are often found in cancer cells . We study genome instability in a fungal pathogen that exhibits a high degree of genetic diversity . Regions that show extraordinary diversity in this pathogen are the transposon-rich accessory chromosomes , which contain few genes that are of unknown benefit to the organism but maintained in the population and thus considered \u201cquasi-essential\u201d . Accessory chromosomes in all fungi studied so far are enriched with markers for heterochromatin , namely trimethylation of H3 lysine 9 and 27 ( H3K9me3 , H3K27me3 ) . We show that loss of these heterochromatin marks has strong but opposing effects on genome stability . While loss of the transposon-associated mark H3K9me3 destabilizes the entire genome , presence of H3K27me3 favors instability of accessory chromosomes . Our study provides insight into the relationship between chromatin and genome stability and why some regions are more susceptible to genetic diversity than others .", "article": "Chromosome and genome stability are important for normal cell function as instability often correlates with disease and dysfunction of DNA repair mechanisms . Many organisms maintain supernumerary or accessory chromosomes that deviate from standard chromosomes . The pathogenic fungus Zymoseptoria tritici has as many as eight accessory chromosomes , which are highly unstable during meiosis and mitosis , transcriptionally repressed , show enrichment of repetitive elements , and enrichment with heterochromatic histone methylation marks , e . g . , trimethylation of H3 lysine 9 or lysine 27 ( H3K9me3 , H3K27me3 ) . To elucidate the role of heterochromatin on genome stability in Z . tritici , we deleted the genes encoding the methyltransferases responsible for H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 , kmt1 and kmt6 , respectively , and generated a double mutant . We combined experimental evolution and genomic analyses to determine the impact of these deletions on chromosome and genome stability , both in vitro and in planta . We used whole genome sequencing , ChIP-seq , and RNA-seq to compare changes in genome and chromatin structure , and differences in gene expression between mutant and wildtype strains . Analyses of genome and ChIP-seq data in H3K9me3-deficient strains revealed dramatic chromatin reorganization , where H3K27me3 is mostly relocalized into regions that are enriched with H3K9me3 in wild type . Many genome rearrangements and formation of new chromosomes were found in the absence of H3K9me3 , accompanied by activation of transposable elements . In stark contrast , loss of H3K27me3 actually increased the stability of accessory chromosomes under normal growth conditions in vitro , even without large scale changes in gene activity . We conclude that H3K9me3 is important for the maintenance of genome stability because it disallows H3K27me3 in regions considered constitutive heterochromatin . In this system , H3K27me3 reduces the overall stability of accessory chromosomes , generating a \u201cmetastable\u201d state for these quasi-essential regions of the genome . \n Chromatin structure plays an important role in genome organization and gene expression [1\u20133] . A well-studied hallmark of epigenetic regulation is the reversible modification of histone tails , which can alter chromatin structure [4] . Chromatin structure determines accessibility of the underlying DNA to regulatory elements , whereby tightly packed DNA , known as heterochromatin , is less accessible for DNA binding proteins and usually shows little transcriptional activity [5] . Heterochromatic regions often cluster together and are spatially separated from more transcriptionally active and accessible euchromatic regions [6] . Specific histone modifications are associated with either heterochromatic or euchromatic regions . Some of the most studied histone modifications are histone H3 lysine 9 di- or trimethylation ( H3K9me2/3 ) and H3K27me2/3 as markers for heterochromatin and H3K4me2/3 as markers for euchromatin [7] . H3K9me2/3 is catalyzed by the histone methyltransferase KMT1 ( Su[var]3\u20139 ) [8 , 9] , in fungi also called Clr4 [10] or DIM-5 [11] . Previous studies demonstrated enrichment of this constitutive heterochromatin mark in repeat-rich regions and a clear link with the control of transposable elements ( TE ) and genome stability [12\u201314] . For example , H3K9 methylation has been shown to be involved in suppression of meiotic recombination in Arabidopsis thaliana [15] and the control of DNA methylation in Neurospora crassa [11] . H3K27me2/3 , usually associated with \u201cfacultative heterochromatin\u201d , is catalyzed by KMT6 ( E[Z] ) as part of the PRC2 complex [16] . In plants , fungi , and animals , this histone mark is used to generate \u201ctranscriptional memory\u201d and is easily reversible when environmental or endogenous stimuli require organismal responses . In many organisms , H3K27 methylation is required for development and cell differentiation [17\u201323] , and aberrant H3K7me3 distribution is prevalent in cancer cells [24\u201326] . In fungi , H3K27me3 correlates with subtelomeric gene silencing [22 , 23 , 27] , and has been shown to play a role in development , pathogenicity , and transcriptional regulation of secondary metabolite gene clusters [21 , 28 , 29] . H3K27me3 is also a hallmark of accessory chromosomes , which are found in several fungal plant pathogens [28 , 30 , 31] . Accessory chromosomes are not essential for survival under all environmental conditions , and thus encode \u201cquasi-essential\u201d genes [32] that can confer selective advantages under some conditions e . g . in a specific host species , resulting in presence or absence of these chromosomes among specific individuals of a given species . They are also characterized by extensive structural rearrangements and length variation [33 , 34] . In some species ( Fusarium oxysporum , Nectria haematococca , Alternaria alternata ) , accessory chromosomes increase virulence [35\u201338] . However , in the wheat pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici , some accessory chromosomes have been demonstrated to confer reduced fitness and virulence in planta [39] , suggesting that there are other stages in the life cycle when they become important . Accessory chromosomes of fungi differ structurally from core chromosomes by higher repeat and lower gene density compared to core chromosomes and show little transcriptional activity [35 , 40\u201343] . Transcriptional silencing can be explained by their predominantly heterochromatic structure , with H3K27me3 enrichment on almost the entire chromosome and H3K9me3 covering repetitive sequences [28 , 30] . Centromeres and telomeres are important structural components of chromosomes . In plants , centromeres of B chromosomes , equivalents to fungal accessory chromosomes , differ from those of A chromosomes [44] , but in Z . tritici centromeres , telomere repeats , and subtelomeric regions are so far by all measures near identical on core and accessory chromosomes [31] . Though accessory chromosomes are a frequent phenomenon in fungi , little is known about their origin and maintenance . Studies on chromosome stability revealed that accessory chromosomes are highly unstable , both during mitosis [36 , 45 , 46] and meiosis [47] . Here , we investigated to what extent the particular histone methylation pattern on accessory chromosomes contributes to the structural differences , transcriptional repression and instability . We shed light on the roles of H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 on genome stability in the hemi-biotrophic wheat pathogen Z . tritici that reproduces both asexually and sexually . By combining experimental evolution with genome , transcriptome and ChIP sequencing , we show that both heterochromatin-associated histone methylation marks contribute significantly , but in distinct ways , to chromosome stability and integrity . While the presence of H3K27me3 enhances chromosome loss and instability , loss of H3K9me3 promotes chromosome breakage , segmental duplications as well as the formation of new chromosomes \u2212 possibly resembling the emergence of accessory chromosomes . Taken together , our findings demonstrate the importance of constitutive heterochromatin for maintaining genome stability and gene silencing as well as an unexpected destabilizing influence of facultative heterochromatin on mitotic accessory chromosome transmission . The presence of eight accessory chromosomes in the reference isolate IPO323 makes Z . tritici an excellent model to study accessory chromosome characteristics and dynamics , which relates to general interest in chromosome maintenance in cancer or other aneuploid cell types . \n To investigate the impact of heterochromatin on fitness , transcription and genome stability in Z . tritici , we generated mutants of two histone methyltransferases Kmt1 ( S . pombe Clr4; N . crassa DIM-5 , Fusarium KMT1 , H . sapiens SUV39H1 ) and Kmt6 ( N . crassa SET-7; Fusarium KMT6; H . sapiens EZH2 ) . We identified the Z . tritici genes by BLAST searches with the N . crassa and F . graminearum protein coding sequences as baits . Kmt1 is encoded by kmt1 ( Zt_chr_1_01919 ) , and Kmt6 is encoded by kmt6 ( Zt_chr_4_00551 ) [48] . We used Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation [49] to delete both genes in a derivate of the Z . tritici reference isolate IPO323 that lost chromosome 18 during in vitro growth , here called Zt09 [31 , 40 , 41] . Correct integration of the hph gene , which confers hygromycin resistance [49] , and kmt1 or kmt6 deletion were verified by PCR and Southern analyses ( S1 and S2 Figs ) . We generated a double deletion mutant by deleting the kmt1 gene in a kmt6 deletion mutant background by using resistance to nourseothricin conferred by the nat gene [50] as an additional selection marker . We isolated several independent transformants , including eight \u0394kmt1 , six \u0394kmt6 and ten \u0394kmt1 \u0394kmt6 double mutants ( from here on abbreviated \u0394k1/k6 ) . For further studies we selected two or three mutants of each type ( S1 Table ) . \u0394kmt1 and \u0394kmt6 single mutants were complemented by re-integrating the previously deleted gene and a neo+ resistance marker that can confer G418 resistance at the native gene loci ( S2 Fig ) . We performed ChIP-seq on Zt09 , \u0394kmt1 ( Zt125-#68 , -#80 ) , \u0394kmt6 ( Zt110-#283 , -#285 , -#365 ) and the double deletion mutant \u0394k1/k6 ( Zt219-#23 , -#116 ) , which verified the absence of H3K9me3 in \u0394kmt1 and \u0394k1/k6 , and the absence of H3K27me3 in \u0394kmt6 and \u0394k1/k6 mutants ( S3 Fig ) , confirming that Kmt1 and Kmt6 are the only histone methyltransferases in Z . tritici responsible for H3K9 and H3K27 trimethylation , respectively . An overview of the subsequent experiments and key results are summarized in S1 Fig . To assess if deletion of kmt1 and kmt6 has an impact on in vitro growth or pathogenicity on wheat , we performed comparative growth and virulence assays comparing the mutants to the wild type Zt09 . To compare growth rates , the reference strain Zt09 , deletion and complemented strains were grown in liquid YMS cultures and the OD600 was measured until cells reached stationary phase . Overall , the \u0394kmt1 strains and \u0394k1/k6 double deletion mutants showed significantly reduced growth in vitro ( S4 Fig ) . The \u0394kmt6 mutants and both kmt1+ and kmt6+ complementation strains showed no significant differences in growth compared to Zt09 ( Wilcoxon rank-sum test , p-values: \u0394kmt1 0 . 025; \u0394kmt6 0 . 42; \u0394k1/k6 0 . 005; kmt1+ 0 . 28; kmt6+ 0 . 63 ) . We furthermore assessed the tolerance of the \u0394kmt1 , \u0394kmt6 and \u0394k1/k6 mutants to abiotic stress in vitro by testing temperature , cell wall , oxidative , and genotoxic stressors . As observed in the growth assays , the \u0394kmt1 and \u0394k1/k6 double deletion mutants showed overall reduced growth under all tested conditions ( S5 Fig ) , especially under osmotic stress induced by high sorbitol concentrations . The \u0394kmt6 mutants showed little differences compared to Zt09; however , elevated temperatures often , but not always , led to increased melanization in the \u0394kmt6 mutants suggesting involvement of H3K27me3 in the response to temperature stress . This phenotype was reversed in the complemented kmt6+ strain ( S6 Fig ) . To study the effect of the histone methyltransferase deletions on the ability to infect wheat ( Triticum aestivum ) , we inoculated leaves of the susceptible cultivar Obelisk with single cell cultures of \u0394kmt1 , \u0394kmt6 , the \u0394k1/k6 double deletion mutant and Zt09 . The infection assays demonstrated significant impact of both H3K27me3 and H3K9me3 on virulence . While the number of pycnidia and necrotic leaf areas only decreased in the \u0394kmt6 mutants , wheat infection by \u0394kmt1 and \u0394k1/k6 mutants resulted in almost no symptoms ( S7 Fig ) . If any symptoms developed , these appeared considerably later than symptoms caused by the reference Zt09 and the \u0394kmt6 mutants ( S7 Fig ) . We next addressed how the deletion of kmt1 and kmt6 impacts the distribution of three histone modifications ( H3K4me2 , H3K9me3 , H3K27me3 ) by ChIP-seq ( S2 Table ) . We previously found that H3K4me2 is associated with gene-rich , transcriptionally active regions on core chromosomes , that constitutive heterochromatin , enriched with H3K9me3 , forms almost exclusively on repetitive elements , and that facultative heterochromatin , enriched with H3K27me3 , forms nearly on the entire length of all accessory chromosomes and the subtelomeric regions of core chromosomes [31] ( Fig 1 ) . We computed the sequence coverage of each histone modification per chromosome to estimate the global effects on chromatin structure . The absence of one histone methylation mark had differential effects on the distribution of the other two methylation marks on core and accessory chromosomes ( Fig 1 , Table 1 ) . In the \u0394kmt1 mutants , the amount of sequences enriched with H3K27me3 decreases on the accessory chromosomes when compared to Zt09 , representing the opposite trend to the observations made on the core chromosomes , where we observed an increased amount of sequences enriched in H3K27me3 ( Fig 1 , Table 1 ) . However , this effect varies on different accessory chromosomes ( Table 1 , Fig 2 ) . The difference in H3K27me3 distribution can be explained by relocation of H3K27me3 to former H3K9me3-associated sequences in the \u0394kmt1 mutant ( Fig 1 ) . While fewer genes are associated with H3K27me3 ( Fig 2 ) , more TEs show H3K27me3 enrichment in the \u0394kmt1 mutant ( Fig 2 ) compared to Zt09 . These observations reveal that loss of H3K9me3 promotes H3K27me3 relocation to TEs and confers simultaneous loss of H3K27me3 at positions with this histone mark in the reference strain . The subtelomeric H3K27me3 enrichment , however , is not affected by this relocation , which explains why we observe opposite effects on core and accessory chromosomes , as core chromosomes predominantly show H3K27me3 enrichment in subtelomeric regions while accessory chromosomes show overall enrichment with H3K27me3 . H3K4me2 increases on both core and accessory chromosomes , with accessory chromosomes showing a considerably higher relative increase compared to H3K4me2 in Zt09 ( Table 1 ) . Conversely , H3K9me3 is not affected by loss of H3K27me3 in the \u0394kmt6 mutants , and we did not detect relocation of H3K9me3 as well as only minor differences in coverage . H3K4me2 enrichment does increase on accessory chromosomes , but not to the same extent as observed in the \u0394kmt1 mutants and it slightly decreases on core chromosomes ( Table 1 ) , suggesting minor effects of \u0394kmt6 on transcriptional activation . In the \u0394k1/k6 double deletion mutants , where both H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 are not present , we detected an increase in H3K4me2 , similar to the \u0394kmt1 single mutants on core chromosomes and slightly higher on the accessory chromosomes . In summary , loss of H3K9me3 has a great impact on H3K27me3 distribution , while loss of H3K27me3 has little influence on H3K9me3 . Deletion of kmt1 promotes large scale relocalization of other histone modifications , suggesting more dramatic effects on genome organization and transcriptional activation than deletion of kmt6 . In other species , H3K27me3 plays a crucial role in gene regulation , while H3K9me3 is involved in silencing of TEs [13 , 21 , 28] . Based on our observations from ChIP-seq data , we hypothesized that the two histone methylation marks have similar effects in Z . tritici . To test this hypothesis directly , we sequenced transcriptomes of two biological replicates of Zt09 and two independent transformants of the \u0394kmt1 , \u0394kmt6 , and \u0394k1/k6 deletion mutants after in vitro growth for 2 days representing exponential growth ( S2 Table ) . First , we compared the total number of expressed genes . In total , 11 , 839 genes are annotated in the reference isolate [48] . Out of these , 8 , 906 are expressed ( RPKM >2 ) in Zt09 during in vitro growth . The number of expressed genes is higher in both the \u0394kmt1 ( 9 , 259 ) and the \u0394k1/k6 ( 9 , 459 ) mutants , but to our surprise , lower in the \u0394kmt6 ( 8 , 717 ) mutants ( Fig 3A , S3 Table ) . This is in contrast to previous studies , where deletion of kmt6 resulted in activation of otherwise silenced gene clusters and overall transcriptional activation [21 , 23 , 27 , 28] . We focused on differential gene expression between core and accessory chromosomes because genes on accessory chromosomes are silent under most conditions that have been tested . While 80% of genes on core chromosomes are expressed in Zt09 , only ~25% of genes located on accessory chromosomes display transcriptional activity . Transcription of genes on accessory chromosomes is higher in all mutant strains , ~40\u201350% ( Fig 3A , S3 Table ) , revealing gene activation on accessory chromosomes specifically upon removal of H3K27me3 or H3K9me3 . We further explored patterns of differential gene expression . Genome wide , 1 , 365 predicted genes were associated with H3K27me3 and 258 genes with H3K9me3 in Zt09 and the vast majority of these genes shows little transcriptional activity . Interestingly , only a small fraction of genes associated with these histone marks were activated or differentially expressed in the mutants ( S4 Table ) . This indicates that loss of any of these methylation marks is not sufficient for transcriptional activation suggesting additional mechanisms involved in the transcriptional regulation of these genes . In other fungi , removal of H3K9me3 and especially H3K27me3 was linked to the activation of certain gene classes , in particular secondary metabolite gene clusters [21 , 28 , 29] . To assess if genes with a specific function are enriched amongst the activated genes , we performed Gene Ontology ( GO ) enrichment analysis ( topGO , Fisher\u2019s exact test , p-value < 0 . 01 ) . Consistent with the higher total number of expressed genes , we found the majority of differentially expressed ( DE ) genes ( DESeq2 , Padj < 0 . 001 , \u2502log2 fold-change\u2502 > 2 ) to be significantly upregulated in the \u0394kmt1 mutant ( 365 of 477 ) and in the \u0394k1/k6 mutant ( 368 of 477 ) , whereas a majority of DE genes was downregulated in the \u0394kmt6 mutant ( 188 of 310 ) ( S5 Table ) . We found two GO categories enriched amongst upregulated genes in \u0394kmt1 and \u0394k1/k6 mutants: DNA integration ( GO:0015074 ) and RNA-dependent DNA replication ( GO:0006278 ) . Predicted functions assessed by BLAST analyses of the proteins encoded by the upregulated genes in these categories include reverse transcriptases , integrases , recombinases and genes containing transposon- or virus-related domains ( S6 Table ) . Consistent with these findings , we detected an increased number of transcripts originating from annotated TEs in the \u0394kmt1 and \u0394k1/k6 mutants , but not in \u0394kmt6 mutants ( Fig 3B ) . This is in agreement with the strong association of TEs with H3K9me3 [31] . Transposons in subtelomeric regions and on accessory chromosomes show additional H3K27me3 enrichment . Removal of H3K9me3 , but not of H3K27me3 , appears to be responsible for transposon activation but transcription is further enhanced when both , H3K27me3 and H3K9me3 are removed in the \u0394k1/k6 mutant ( Fig 3B; S7 Table ) . Amongst the genes upregulated in the \u0394kmt6 mutant no GO categories were enriched but based on the previous finding of secondary metabolite activation , we further investigated possible roles of H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 in secondary metabolite gene regulation . Therefore , we identified putative secondary metabolite clusters in the Z . tritici reference genome using antiSMASH ( antibiotics & Secondary Metabolite Analysis SHell ) [51] . We found a total of 27 secondary metabolite clusters , all located on core chromosomes , and merged the identified genes with the existing gene annotation ( S8 Table ) . Except for the activation of one putative cluster on chromosome 7 in the \u0394k1/k6 mutant , we did not identify any differential expression of genes in secondary metabolite clusters . Based on these findings , we conclude that , unlike in other fungi [21 , 29] , H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 are not involved in transcriptional regulation of secondary metabolites in Z . tritici under the tested conditions . Taken together , removal of these histone modifications has little consequences for the expression of the vast majority of associated genes . As expected from its localization , loss of H3K9me3 increases expression of TEs while absence of H3K27me3 by itself has very little impact on transcriptional activation , thus suggesting that in this organism H3K27me3 does not delineate stereotypical \u201cfacultative heterochromatin\u201d as removal of H3K27me3 does not activate gene expression . Chromosome landmarks , namely centromeric and pericentric regions , telomere repeats and subtelomeric regions are similar on core and accessory chromosomes in Z . tritici [31] . Accessory chromosomes are enriched with TEs but share the same TE families as core chromosomes [48] . Nevertheless , accessory chromosomes of Z . tritici are highly unstable , both during meiosis and vegetative growth in vitro and in planta [46 , 47] . The most striking feature that sets these chromosomes apart is almost chromosome-wide enrichment with H3K27me3 and , as a consequence of the higher TE content , increased enrichment with H3K9me3 [31] . To test whether loss of these modifications affects genome and chromosome stability in Z . tritici , we conducted two different long-term growth or \u201clab evolution\u201d experiments to study genome stability and to detect dynamics of accessory chromosome losses in strains deficient for two important chromatin marks ( S8 Fig ) . To assess whether the specific histone methylation pattern on accessory chromosomes contributes to instability of accessory chromosomes , we performed a short-term in vitro growth experiment over four weeks , representing ~80 asexual generations . Zt09 , \u0394kmt6 , \u0394kmt1 and a \u0394k1/k6 double deletion mutant , as well as the complemented strains kmt1+ and kmt6+ were used as progenitors in the experiment . The presence of all accessory chromosomes in the progenitor strains was verified by PCR at the beginning of the experiment . Each strain was grown in three replicate cultures and ~4% of the cell population was transferred to fresh medium every three to four days . After four weeks of growth , we plated dilutions of each culture to obtain single colonies that were subsequently screened by a PCR assay for the presence of accessory chromosomes ( Table 2 ) . Previously , we showed that accessory chromosomes are lost at a rate of ~7% in Zt09 and we documented that accessory chromosomes 14 , 15 and 16 are more frequently lost than others [46] . Here we demonstrate that , in comparison to Zt09 , the \u0394kmt1 mutant showed a significantly increased chromosome loss rate ( one sided Fisher\u2019s exact test for count data , p-value = 2 . 7 x 10\u22126 ) . Interestingly , this was not due to an overall increase of accessory chromosome loss , but rather by the dramatically increased ( Fisher\u2019s exact test , p-value = 3 . 7 x 10\u22129 ) frequency of loss for chromosome 20 ( Table 2 ) . The chromosome loss rate of the other accessory chromosomes was either comparable to Zt09 ( Chr . 14 , 17 , 19 , 21 ) or even significantly lower ( Chr . 15 and 16 , Fisher\u2019s exact test , p-values = 1 . 2 x 10\u22123 and 2 . 5 x 10\u22125 ) . This suggests a special role of H3K9me3 for the maintenance of chromosome 20 . In contrast to the \u0394kmt1 mutants , we detected significantly fewer chromosome losses ( Fisher\u2019s exact test , p-value = 1 . 2 x 10\u22124 ) in the \u0394kmt6 mutants . Out of 576 tested colonies , only ten had lost an accessory chromosome . This represents a four times lower chromosome loss rate compared to wild type . Therefore , absence of H3K27me3 appears to promote stability of accessory chromosomes . Interestingly , chromosome 17 was lost with the highest frequency in this mutant ( 5/10 ) but was not lost in any of the other mutant strains or in the wild type . The double deletion mutant displayed a similar chromosome loss rate as wild type but showed a chromosome loss distribution comparable to the \u0394kmt1 deletion strain with chromosome 20 being lost significantly more often ( Fisher\u2019s exact test , p-value = 1 . 23 10\u22124 ) , and chromosomes 15 and 16 lost less frequently ( Fisher\u2019s exact test , p-values = 1 . 95 x 10\u22123 and 9 x 10\u22123 , respectively ) . This suggests that the increase in chromosome stability in \u0394k1/k6 compared to \u0394kmt1 is due to the removal of the destabilizing H3K27me3 . We considered possible reasons for the high rates of loss of chromosome 20 in \u0394kmt1 and \u0394k1/k6 mutant strains by a detailed analysis of TE content , genes and histone methylation redistribution on this chromosome . The proportion of TEs on chromosome 20 is ~23% and thereby considerably lower than the average across the eight accessory chromosomes ( 33 . 6% TE content ) . Consistent with patterns found on the other accessory chromosomes we find no enrichment of specific TE families [48] . Out of the 91 genes on chromosome 20 , none has known or even predicted functions; it is therefore difficult to correlate potential gene functions of any of these genes to the enhanced loss rate . Chromosome 20 is one of the chromosomes that exhibits the highest extent of H3K27me3 redistribution ( Fig 2 ) and loss of H3K27me3 in the \u0394k1/k6 double mutant decreases the high loss rate . However , chromosome 20 is still lost at a higher rate in \u0394k1/k6 compared to Zt09 , indicating that other , so far unknown , factors are involved in this instability . Moreover , not all accessory chromosomes that exhibit H3K27me3 redistribution ( 19 and 21 ) are lost at higher rates , and not all accessory chromosomes are lost at the same rate in the Zt09 wild type , despite being enriched with H3K27me3 , further suggesting that additional mechanisms are involved in the instability of chromosome 20 . Both complemented strains , kmt1+ and kmt6+ , showed chromosome loss rates similar to the wild type strain Zt09 and the highest loss rates for the largest accessory chromosomes ( Table 2 ) . This strongly suggests that indeed the absence of the two histone methyltransferases and the respective histone marks influence accessory chromosome dynamics . In summary , we found that loss of H3K27me3 increases accessory chromosome stability , suggesting a mechanistic explanation for how the widespread H3K27me3 enrichment on accessory chromosomes in normal cells contributes to the previously observed extraordinary chromosome instability . In a second evolution experiment , we addressed overall genome stability over a longer period of mitotic growth . The single mutants ( \u0394kmt1 and \u0394kmt6 ) and Zt09 were grown in triplicate cultures for ~6 months , representing ~500 asexual generations . We sequenced full genomes of progenitors and the evolved populations after 50 transfers to identify structural variations that arose during the experiment . All strains were sequenced to ~100x coverage by Illumina sequencing , and paired-end reads were mapped to the reference genome of IPO323 and normalized to 1x coverage for visualization [40] . We focused our analysis on large scale chromosomal rearrangements such as duplications , deletions , and translocations . Structural variation was detected computationally from sequence alignments , validated experimentally by PFGE and Southern blotting , and additional rearrangements were identified by manual screening of mapped reads . Analysis of progenitor genomes revealed , except for the already known absence of chromosome 18 [41] and the previously described variations ( point mutations and short indels ) in Zt09 compared to the IPO323 reference genome [46] , lower sequence coverage ( ~0 . 6x ) on chromosome 17 in the \u0394kmt6 progenitor strain ( Fig 4A ) . This difference can only be explained by a lower copy number in the sequenced pool of cells , suggesting loss of chromosome 17 in ~40% of the sequenced \u0394kmt6 cells , a chromosome loss that likely occurred at the very beginning of the experiment . Unexpectedly , the \u0394kmt1 progenitor displayed a long high-coverage ( ~1 . 6x ) region on chromosome 1 ( Fig 4 ) , suggesting that the region had been duplicated in ~60% of the sequenced \u0394kmt1 cells . Furthermore , this genome has a shorter chromosome 6 and does not contain chromosome 20 ( Fig 4A , S9 Table ) . The presence of this kind of structural variation in the progenitor strain is indicative for a high degree of genome instability in absence of Kmt1 . Analysis of discordant reads mapped to both ends of the ~1 Mb high-coverage region on chromosome 1 revealed telomeric repeats ( TTAGGGn ) , suggesting the formation of de novo telomeres . Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis ( PFGE ) and Southern analyses confirmed the formation of two new independent chromosomes both containing the high-coverage region and either the right or left arm of chromosome 1 ( Fig 4C ) . The breakpoint on the left side coincides with a large TE-rich region that is associated with H3K9me3 in the wild type . Both breakpoints coincide with or are in close proximity to regions that show enrichment of relocated H3K27me3 in the \u0394kmt1 mutant ( Fig 4B ) , suggesting a possible link between relocated H3K27me3 and genome instability . After six months of vegetative growth , we sequenced the pooled genomes of all nine \u2018evolved\u2019 populations . We found no evidence for large-scale genomic rearrangements in any of the evolved Zt09 or \u0394kmt6 populations ( Fig 5A ) . Apart from seven small deletions or duplications ( S9 Table ) , the largest structural variation found in one of the evolved \u0394kmt6 populations ( \u0394kmt6 50\u20132 ) , was a partial loss ( ~18 kb ) at the right end of chromosome 15 . However , we found variation in the read coverage of accessory chromosomes in all sequenced genomes indicating whole chromosome losses in individual cells of the sequenced population . The distinct dynamics of individual accessory chromosome losses were described in the previous section as part of the short-term growth results ( Table 2 ) . In contrast to the few variations detected in the Zt09 and \u0394kmt6 populations , we found numerous large-scale high-coverage regions on different core chromosomes , chromosome breakages followed by de novo telomere formation , chromosomal fusions , as well as several smaller deletions and duplications in the evolved \u0394kmt1 populations ( Fig 5A , S9 Table ) . All three evolved \u0394kmt1 populations have large duplicated regions on chromosome 1 ( Fig 6 ) , but their locations as well as the resulting structural variations differ from the one identified in the progenitor strain ( Fig 6A ) . This can be explained by independent events , as not all \u0394kmt1 progenitor cells underwent the rearrangement of chromosome 1 ( Fig 4C ) , or by continuous structural rearrangement events as a consequence of the presence of large duplicated regions in the genome . Analyses of the affected regions and breakpoints indicate a connection between the structural variations of progenitor ( compared to the reference ) and evolved strains . In all evolved \u0394kmt1 populations , duplicated regions fully or partially overlap with the high-coverage region of the progenitor strain ( Fig 6A\u20136D ) . Since populations reflect a mixture of distinct genotypes , we also sequenced three single \u0394kmt1 clones originating from the populations from transfer 50 to characterize the structural variation in more detail ( Fig 5B ) . The single clones were selected based on different PFGE karyotypes ( S9 Fig ) and originated from population \u0394kmt1-50-1 ( \u0394kmt1-50-1-1 ) and \u0394kmt1-50-2 ( \u0394kmt1-50-2-1 and \u0394kmt1-50-2-2 ) . As two of these single clones ( \u0394kmt1-50-1-1 and \u0394kmt1-50-2-2 ) largely resemble the genotypes found in their respective populations , we conclude the presence of a predominant genotype in each evolved replicate population . However , \u0394kmt1-50-2-1 clearly differs from this genotype and therefore reveals the existence of additional , rarer genotypes in the evolved populations . Relatively small deletions and duplications ( up to 30 kb ) as well as chromosome breakage followed by de novo telomere formation were found on almost all chromosomes . These occurred mainly linked to annotated TEs ( S10 Table ) whereby loss of H3K9me3 likely promoted instability . However , major rearrangements , including chromosomal fusions , were always linked to large segmental duplications ( S10 Fig ) . In two strains we detected higher coverage of entire core chromosomes indicating core chromosome duplications ( Fig 5B ) . Results from read coverage ( S10 Table ) and PCR analyses indicate that \u0394kmt1-50-2-2 , as well as the majority of the \u0394kmt1-50-2 population , may have undergone a whole genome duplication . To investigate whether the underlying sequence is involved in the formation of large-scale rearrangements , we analyzed the breakpoints of each duplicated region . The location of breakpoints does not show a clear TE-associated pattern as observed for the smaller deletions or chromosome breakages . Out of 28 analyzed breakpoints , only seven are directly located within annotated TEs , while thirteen fall into genes , seven are intergenic and one is located in the centromere ( S11 Table ) . Considering all structural rearrangements in the three sequenced single clones , we found that out of 62 events , 34 were associated ( direct overlap or <5 kb distance ) to regions that show enrichment for H3K27me3 ( S12 Table ) . Based on these observations , we hypothesize that two non-exclusive pathways , namely TE-associated instability caused by loss of H3K9me3 or invasion of H3K27me3 , may serve as initial events , which are followed by continuous rearrangements possibly caused by increased mitotic recombination activity and deficiency in DNA repair resulting in a spectrum of structural variation ( S11 Fig ) . \n We investigated the effects of loss of two important heterochromatin-associated histone modifications , H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 , on chromatin organization , transcription and genome stability and characterized phenotypes of the deletion mutants . Loss of H3K9me3 allows relocalization of H3K27me3 in kmt1 deletion mutants , which has great impact on genome and chromosome stability , resulting in numerous large-scale rearrangements . In contrast , the genomes of evolved \u0394kmt6 and Zt09 strains revealed only few and relatively minor changes . Unexpectedly , the presence of H3K27me3 impacts chromosome stability by either destabilizing whole chromosomes in normal cells , supported by the high loss-rate in the reference strain compared to the \u0394kmt6 mutants , or by mislocalization as shown by the increased sequence instability in the \u0394kmt1 mutants . Taken together , enrichment with H3K27me3 in wild type cells is a main driver of mitotic chromosome instability . We propose different scenarios for how chromosomes may get lost during mitosis and how H3K27me3 may be linked to these processes . For example , accessory chromosomes may not be accurately replicated whereby only one sister chromatid is transmitted . Alternatively , non-disjunction of sister chromatids during mitosis produces one cell with two copies and one cell lacking the respective chromosome . Previous cytology on Z . tritici strains expressing GFP-tagged CENPA/CenH3 protein suggested that core and accessory chromosomes may be physically separated in the nucleus [31] . Previous studies showed that H3K27me3-enriched chromatin localizes near the nuclear periphery , and loss of H3K27me3 enables movement of this chromatin to the nucleus core in mammals and fungi [52 , 53] . Proximity to the nuclear membrane and heterochromatic structure can furthermore result in differential , and often late , replication timing [54 , 55] . Loss of H3K27me3 and the correlated movement to the inner nuclear matrix may alter replication dynamics of accessory chromosomes resulting in higher rates of faithfully replicated chromosomes and lower rates of mitotic loss ( Fig 7 ) . Heterochromatic regions , especially associated with H3K27me3 , tend to cluster together and form distinct foci in the nucleus of Drosophila melanogaster visualized by cytology [56 , 57] , and loss of H3K27me3 reduces interaction between these regions [58] . We hypothesize that enrichment of H3K27me3 on the entire accessory chromosomes maintains physical interactions that persist throughout mitosis . This may decrease the efficiency of separation of sister chromatids resulting in loss of the chromosome in one cell and a duplication in the other cell . So far , we have focused our screening on chromosome losses but determining the exact rates of accessory chromosome duplications is necessary to test this hypothesis . Genome sequencing of Z . tritici chromosome loss strains revealed that duplications of accessory chromosomes can occur [46] . Similarly , B chromosomes in rye are preferentially inherited during meiosis by non-disjunction of sister chromatids during the first pollen mitosis [59] , indicating that deviation from normal chromosome segregation occurs . Accessory chromosomes are commonly found in natural isolates of Z . tritici , despite the high loss rates we demonstrated during mitotic growth [46] . This observation implies the presence of other mechanisms that counteract the frequent losses of accessory chromosomes . Recent analyses of meiotic transmission showed that unpaired accessory chromosomes are transmitted at higher rates in a uniparental way [60 , 61] . We propose that H3K27me3 is involved in accessory chromosome instability and transmission both during mitosis and meiosis by influencing nuclear localization of chromosomes and thereby altering replication or transmission ( Fig 7 ) . Future analyses with fluorescently tagged core and accessory chromosomes and by chromosome conformation capture ( Hi-C ) will shed light on nuclear interactions and chromosome transmission dynamics . As not all accessory chromosomes , despite being enriched with H3K27me3 , are lost at the same rate , we note that additional mechanisms likely contribute to accessory chromosome dynamics . While loss of H3K27me3 resulted in only minor differences to wild type growth and , unexpectedly , rather promoted than decreased genome stability , we detected a high number of smaller ( up to 30 kb ) deletions and duplications , chromosome breakages and several gross chromosomal rearrangements linked to large duplications in the \u0394kmt1 mutants . Absence of H3K9me2/3 has been associated with chromosome and genome instability in other organisms [13 , 14 , 62 , 63] . Smaller deletions , duplications and chromosome breakages resulting in shortened chromosomes due to loss of chromosome ends that we identified in the \u0394kmt1 mutants , correlate with TEs , enriched with H3K9me3 in wild type . Replication of heterochromatin-associated DNA is challenging for the cell as repetitive sequences may form secondary structures that can stall the replication machinery [64] . Consequently , instability of repeated sequences has been linked to errors during DNA replication [65\u201367] . Furthermore , the structural variation that arises depends on the mode of DNA repair following the DNA damage [68 , 69] . The structural rearrangements detected in the \u0394kmt1 mutants indicate that repair of double-strand breaks involves both non-homologous end joining and de novo telomere formation . We propose that the main factor for genome instability is replication-associated instability of repeated sequences subsequently promoting the formation of large-scale rearrangements ( S11 Fig ) . Not all breakpoints of rearrangements , especially of the large duplicated sequences , were associated with TEs , however . We found that duplicated sequences in the experimentally evolved \u0394kmt1 mutants fully or partially overlap with the duplicated regions of the \u0394kmt1 progenitor strain . This suggests that structural variations are subject to continuous rearrangements , resulting in rearrangements no longer directly linked to the initial event . We note that the rearrangements and genotypes we detected are the result of selection during our long-term growth experiments and thus do not necessarily reflect the full spectrum of rearrangements occurring in \u0394kmt1 mutants; many additional structural variants may have disappeared quickly from the population or included lethal events . Concomitant with loss of H3K9me3 in the \u0394kmt1 strains , we found relocalization of H3K27me3 to former H3K9me3 regions . A similar redistribution of H3K27me3 in absence of heterochromatin factors has been reported in plants and animals [70\u201372] and other fungi [22 , 27 , 73] . In N . crassa , redistribution of H3K27me3 in a \u0394kmt1 ( dim-5 ) mutant background results in severe growth defects and increased sensitivity to genotoxic stress that can be rescued by elimination of H3K27me3 , indicating that aberrant H3K27me3 distribution severely impacts cell viability [27] . Although we did not see rescue of phenotypic defects observed in planta or in in vitro stress assays in the \u0394k1/k6 double mutants , the chromosome-loss rate was reduced compared to \u0394kmt1 mutants , suggesting a stabilizing effect when H3K27me3 is absent . We found that some breakpoints of the rearrangements in the \u0394kmt1 mutants without H3K9me3 also show enrichment with the invading H3K27me3 . This finding also suggests that sequences associated with H3K27me3 are more susceptible to genome instability . Regions enriched with H3K27me3 have been shown to exhibit a high degree of genetic variability in form of mutations , increased recombination , or structural variation compared to the rest of the genome [21 , 23 , 30 , 31 , 74\u201376] . Experimental evolution in Fusarium fujikuroi showed that increased H3K27me3 levels in subtelomeric regions coincided with increased instability [77] and we previously detected a highly increased rate of chromosomal breakage under stress conditions in subtelomeric H3K27me3 regions in Z . tritici [46] . These observations together with our findings strongly indicate that H3K27me3 plays a pivotal role in decreasing genome stability . In summary , the presence of Kmt1 and H3K9me3 respectively , is essential to maintain genome integrity in this fungus . TE-mediated rearrangements may be involved in the genetic variability detected in Z . tritici isolates [78\u201380] and have been suggested as drivers of genome evolution in various species [81\u201383] . Our findings concerning the role of H3K9me3 for genome stability provide a basis for future studies focusing on the influence of heterochromatin on structural genome rearrangements using Z . tritici as a model organism . We found that , unlike for H3K9me3 , presence and not absence of H3K27me3 is linked to genome instability . Surprisingly , loss of H3K27me3 does not result in dramatic changes of overt phenotypes and is also not clearly linked to transcriptional activation in Z . tritici . This allowed us to uncouple the transcriptional and regulatory effects of H3K27me3 from the influence on chromatin stability and will in the future result in further mechanistic insights on the influence of histone modifications on chromosome stability . \n Zymoseptoria tritici strains were cultivated on solid ( 2% [w/v] Bacto agar ) or in liquid YMS medium ( 0 . 4% [w/v] yeast extract , 0 . 4% [w/v] malt extract , 0 . 4% [w/v] sucrose ) . Liquid cultures were inoculated from plate or directly from glycerol stocks and grown for 3\u20134 days at 18\u00b0C in a shaking incubator at 200 rpm . Plates were inoculated from glycerol stocks and grown for 5\u20136 days at 18\u00b0C . Escherichia coli TOP10 cells were grown overnight in dYT ( 1 . 6% [w/v] tryptone , 1% [w/v] yeast extract , 0 . 5% [w/v] NaCl and 2% Bacto agar for solid medium ) supplemented with antibiotics for plasmid selection ( 40 \u03bcg/mL kanamycin ) at 37\u00b0C and at 200 rpm for liquid cultures . Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain AGL1 was grown in dYT containing rifampicin ( 50 \u03bcg/mL ) and carbenicillin ( 100 \u03bcg/mL ) supplemented with antibiotics for plasmid selection ( 40 \u03bcg/mL kanamycin ) at 28\u00b0C at 200 rpm in liquid culture for 18 h and on plate at 28\u00b0C for two days . Z . tritici deletion and complementation strains were engineered using A . tumefaciens-mediated transformations as described before [49 , 84] . Flanking regions of the respective genes were used to facilitate homologous recombination for integration at the correct genomic location . The plasmid pES61 ( a derivate of the binary vector pNOV-ABCD [49] ) was used for targeted gene deletion and complementation . Plasmids were assembled using a restriction enzyme-based approach or Gibson assembly [85] . Plasmids were amplified in E . coli TOP10 cells and transformed in the A . tumefaciens strain AGL1 as described previously [86] . Gene deletions of kmt1 ( Zt09_chr_1_01919 ) and kmt6 ( Zt09_chr_4_00551 ) were facilitated by replacement of the respective ORF with a hygromycin resistance cassette ( hph ) . The kmt1/kmt6 double deletion mutant was constructed by integrating a nourseothricin resistance cassette ( nat ) replacing kmt1 in a kmt6 deletion mutant background . Complementation constructs containing the respective gene and a G418 resistance cassette ( neo ) were integrated at the native loci in the deletion strains . All plasmids and strains constructed in this study are listed in S1 Table . Transformed strains were screened by PCR for correct integrations of the construct followed by Southern blot [87] with probes generated by DIG labeling ( Roche , Mannheim , Germany ) following manufacturer\u2019s instructions . For rapid PCR screening ( candidates for transformation and chromosome loss ) , a single Z . tritici colony was resuspended in 50 \u03bcL of 25 mM NaOH , incubated at 98\u00b0C for 10 min and afterwards 50 \u03bcL of 40 mM Tris-HCl pH 5 . 5 were added . Four \u03bcl of the mix was used as template for PCRs . For DNA extraction for Southern blotting , we used a standard phenol-chloroform extraction protocol [88] for DNA isolation . For the in vitro growth assays , liquid YMS cultures were inoculated with 100 cells/\u03bcL ( OD600 = 0 . 01 ) ; cells were grown in 25 mL YMS at 18\u00b0C and 200 rpm . For each mutant and complementation strain , two transformants ( biological replicates ) , and three replicate cultures per transformant ( technical replicates ) were used . For the reference strain Zt09 , two separate pre-cultures were grown as biological replicates and each pre-culture was used to inoculate three replicate cultures . OD600 was measured at different time points throughout the experiment until the stationary phase was reached . The R package growthcurver [89] was used to fit the growth curve data enabling to compare in vitro growth of the different strains . To test the tolerance of mutant and reference strains towards different stressors , we performed an in vitro stress assay on YMS plates . Each plate contained additives constituting different stress conditions . Cell suspensions containing 107/108 cells/mL and a tenfold dilution series down to 100 cells/mL were prepared; 3 \u03bcL of each dilution were pipetted on solid YMS containing the following additives: 0 . 5 M NaCl , 1 M NaCl , 1 M sorbitol , 1 . 5 M sorbitol , 1 . 5 mM H2O2 , 2 mM H2O2 , 300 \u03bcg/mL Congo red , 0 . 01% MMS ( methyl methane sulfonate ) , 0 . 025% MMS , 1 \u03bcg/mL actinomycin D and 1 . 5 \u03bcg/mL actinomycin D . Furthermore , we included a H2O-agar ( 2% bacto agar ) plate . All plates were incubated at 18\u00b0C for six days , except for one YMS plate that was incubated at 28\u00b0C to test for thermal stress responses . Seedlings of the susceptible wheat cultivar Obelisk ( Wiersum Plantbreeding BV , Winschoten , The Netherlands ) were potted ( three plants per pot ) after four days of pre-germination and grown for seven more days . Single cell suspensions of mutant and reference strain were prepared ( 108 cells / mL in H2O with 0 . 1% Tween 20 ) and brush inoculated on a marked area of the second leaf . Following inoculation , the plants were incubated in sealed plastic bags containing ~ 1 L of H2O for 48 h providing high humidity to promote infections . Growth conditions for the plants throughout the complete growth phase and infection were 16 h light ( 200 \u03bcmol/m-2s-1 ) and 8 h dark at 20\u00b0C and 90% humidity . First appearances of symptoms , necrosis or pycnidia , were assessed by manual inspection of every treated leaf . 21 or 28 days post infection , inoculated leaves were finally screened for infection symptoms . Visual inspection of each leaf was performed to evaluate the percentage of leaf area covered by necrosis and pycnidia . Six different categories were differentiated based on the observed coverage ( 0: 0% , 1: 1\u201320% , 2: 21\u201340% , 3: 41\u201360% , 4: 61\u201380% , 5: 81\u2013100% ) . Furthermore , automated symptom evaluation was performed by analysis of scanned images of infected leaf areas as described previously [90] . For the long-term evolution experiment ( ~6 months ) , cells were inoculated directly from the glycerol stocks into 20 mL liquid YMS cultures . We used Zt09 , \u0394kmt6 ( #285 ) and \u0394kmt1 ( #68 ) , each strain grown in triplicates . Every three to four days , cells were transferred to new YMS medium . Cells were grown at 18\u00b0C and 200 rpm . For every transfer , cell density of the cultures was measured by OD600 and the new cultures were inoculated with a cell density of ~ 100 cells / \u03bcL ( correlating to a transfer of 0 . 1% of the population ) . After 50 transfers , the genomes of the evolved populations and each progenitor strain were sequenced . Additionally , three genomes of single clones derived from the \u0394kmt1 populations after 50 transfers were sequenced to characterize genome rearrangements in more detail . For the short-term evolution experiment over a time period of four weeks , cultures were inoculated from single colonies grown on solid YMS . Zt09 , \u0394kmt6 ( #285 ) , \u0394kmt1 ( #80 ) , \u0394k1/\u0394k6 ( #23 ) double mutant , kmt1+ ( #42 ) and kmt6+ ( #11 ) were grown in triplicate YMS cultures . For this experiment we used a different independent \u0394kmt1 mutant clone ( #80 ) , as we discovered that the strain used in the previous long-term evolution experiment ( #68 ) was missing chromosome 20 . Every three to four days , 900 \u03bcL culture were transferred to 25 mL fresh YMS ( correlating to a transfer of ~ 4% of the population ) . After four weeks of growth ( including eight transfers to new medium ) at 18\u00b0C and 200 rpm , cultures were diluted and plated on YMS agar to obtain single colonies . These single colonies were PCR screened for presence of accessory chromosomes as described in [46] . Cells were grown in YMS medium for five days and harvested by centrifugation for 10 min at 3 , 500 rpm . We used 5 x 108 cells for plug preparation that were washed twice with Tris-HCl , pH 7 . 5 , resuspended in 1 mL TE buffer ( pH 8 ) and mixed with 1 mL of 2 . 2% low range ultra agarose ( Bio-Rad , Munich , Germany ) . The mixture was pipetted into plug casting molds and cooled for 1 h at 4\u00b0C .

Unfortunately , life-saving rabies vaccines and biologicals are often neither accessible nor affordable , particularly to the poorest sectors of society who are most at risk and upon whom the largest burden of rabies falls . Increasing accessibility , reducing costs and preventing delays in delivery of PEP should therefore be prioritized . We analyzed different PEP vaccination regimens and evaluated their relative costs and benefits to bite victims and healthcare providers . We found PEP vaccination to be an extremely cost-effective intervention ( from $200 to less than $60/death averted ) . Switching from intramuscular ( IM ) administration of PEP to equally efficacious intradermal ( ID ) regimens was shown to result in significant savings in the volume of vaccine required to treat the same number of patients , which could mitigate vaccine shortages , and would dramatically reduce the costs of implementing PEP . We present financing mechanisms that would make PEP more affordable and accessible , could help subsidize the cost for those most in need , and could even support new and existing rabies control and prevention programs . We conclude that a universal switch to ID delivery would improve the affordability and accessibility of PEP for bite victims , leading to a likely reduction in human rabies deaths , as well as being economical for healthcare providers . \n Rabies is invariably fatal once clinical signs appear but can be readily prevented after exposure with prompt and appropriate post-exposure prophylaxis ( PEP ) [1] . PEP is therefore the most critical life-saving intervention essential for the prevention of rabies in humans after exposure [2] . In reality , most of the estimated 7 million people exposed to rabies each year live in resource poor countries where life-saving rabies vaccines are not always available or easily affordable [3] , [4] , [5] , [6] . This stark situation contributes to the fact that almost all of the estimated 55 , 000 annual human rabies deaths occur in Africa and Asia where the virus circulates endemically in domestic dog populations [7] . The WHO-recommended PEP protocol includes immediate wound washing , expeditious administration of rabies vaccine , and for severe categories of exposure , infiltration of purified rabies immunoglobulin ( RIG ) in and around the wound [8] . RIG is rarely administered in low-income countries because it is expensive ( from USD$25 to over USD$200 depending on whether it is of equine or human origin ) [7] , [9] and in short supply ( see the following examples: [3] , [4] , [5] , [10] ) . Therefore , it is usually only post-exposure vaccination ( without RIG ) that is administered to protect a bite victim from succumbing to rabies [3] . Several factors affect the likelihood of promptly obtaining and completing PEP vaccination . Vaccine vials cost from USD$7\u201320 in most low-income countries and multiple vials are required per patient contingent upon the PEP regimen used . In some countries , governments provide vaccine free-of-charge or subsidize its cost , but budgets allocated for this are often insufficient , resulting in shortages or leaving only a few centres with a reliable supply . Alternatively , victims pay for vaccine , but charges are often prohibitive [3] . Costs of travel and or accommodation accumulate according to the number of clinic visits that a patient and , in many cases , an accompanying family member , makes to complete PEP . These considerable indirect costs [7] are affected by vaccine availability , and rise during shortages when patients and families are forced to travel further ( often to multiple clinics ) , wasting time and money [3] . Delays caused by shortages also reduce compliance . All too often victims fail to promptly obtain or complete PEP , which in the worst cases results in rabies deaths [3] , [4] , [5] . Following WHO approval of intradermal ( ID ) administration of PEP vaccines [11] , there has been significant discussion of the value of ID versus intramuscular ( IM ) delivery [2] , [12] , [13] , [14] , [15] , [16] , [17] . The main argument is that ID vaccination is more economical because smaller volumes of vaccine can be used to elicit an equivalent immune response ( 0 . 1 mL for each ID injection versus one 0 . 5 or 1 mL vial for each IM injection ) . The caveat of ID regimens is that vaccine remaining in partially used vials must be discarded within 6 to 8 hours to minimize risks of bacterial contamination ( current vaccines do not contain preservatives ) [2] , [18] , which may be perceived as waste . Moreover , vial sharing amongst patients may lead to practical difficulties in health provider budgeting . All WHO-recommended PEP regimens for WHO pre-qualified vaccines are safe , immunogenic , and efficacious . Thus policy should aim to prevent failures in PEP delivery by preventing vaccine shortages , reducing costs for victims and healthcare providers and promoting patient compliance to ensure PEP efficacy . The variety of WHO-recommended PEP regimens allows flexibility , but can lead to confusion regarding which regimen best meets the needs for a specific setting . Additionally , new regimens are continually being developed that require evaluation prior to implementation . Here , we provide a framework for comparing cost-effectiveness of different PEP regimens ( including existing approved regimens and new candidates subject to approval ) from the perspective of both healthcare providers and bite victims under a range of scenarios ( from low to high throughput clinics ) and under realistic constraints ( poor patient compliance and some vaccine wastage ) . We discuss the implications for PEP affordability , availability and accessibility and offer recommendations for policy formulation and vaccine research . \n We used cost data associated with rabies reported from previous studies ( Table 2 ) . These include direct ( medical ) costs corresponding to rabies vaccines and their administration and indirect ( non-medical ) costs including transport to and from clinics and loss of income while receiving PEP . We assume that the time taken to vaccinate a patient is equivalent for both ID and IM administration and we did not include costs of RIG because most bite victims in Africa and Asia do not receive RIG [3] , [4] , [5] . We explored vaccine use according to different model inputs that are detailed in Table 3 and defined as follows: We analyzed outcomes in terms of savings in vaccine use , human rabies cases averted and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios . We evaluated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios ( ICER ) in terms of dollars per rabies death averted: costsPEP/ ( EffectivenessPEP-EffectivenessNo PEP ) , where subscripts refer to whether or not PEP vaccination was administered . We calculated cost-effectiveness from the perspective of the health provider and included only direct medical costs . We also modify this calculation of cost-effectiveness under poor compliance and according to hypothesized protective efficacy of incomplete vaccination ( Table 3 ) . We compiled data on clinic throughputs in different settings and calculated the annual costs of PEP vaccination using different regimens for these settings . In practice , many clinics operate on a cost-recovery basis and charge for PEP . However , the number of new and returning animal-bite patients expected at a clinic on a daily basis cannot be precisely predicted , making it difficult to determine appropriate charges for ID administration . We compared four pricing strategies: 1 ) charging patients per injection according to the amount of vaccine used; 2 ) charging patients per injection at rates that are marginally higher than the price of the amount of vaccine used ( illustrated with patients paying per injection at a rate that is 25% or 30% of vial costs ) ; 3 ) charging patients a set price on their first visit ( illustrated with a fee equivalent to 1 . 5 vials ) , but providing all subsequent doses without payment; 4 ) charging patients the price of one vial for each of their first and second hospital visits , but providing vaccine for free on subsequent visits . For all the strategies we assume that patients pay the costs of materials for vaccination and a consultation fee , which is equivalent to the price of overhead for a clinic visit in addition to the vaccination costs described above . We explored implications for cost recuperation ( based on costs of PEP delivery shown in Table 2 ) by estimating annual savings of the different pricing strategies dependent upon throughput and the regimen in use . We present the net gains under these pricing strategies for the updated TRC regimen ( the only currently WHO approved ID regimen ) for clinics for which throughput data was compiled . We compare the costs of PEP for bite-victims , depending upon the pricing strategies described above and including the provision of PEP free-of-charge and under different assumptions about indirect costs ( based on the range of indirect costs in Table 2 ) . Specifically we assume that bite victims travel further to reach a clinic in rural rather than urban settings and incur correspondingly higher costs . We also calculate the likely risks for patients of poor PEP compliance according to assumptions about vaccine efficacy ( Table 2 ) and explore how costs may affect compliance with PEP regimens and implications for the risk of developing rabies . All analyses were performed using the statistical programming language R . Scripts implementing our simulations are available upon request . \n For IM vaccination , both the reduced 4-dose Essen and the Zagreb regimens are more economical than the 5-dose Essen because they use only 4 vaccine vials in comparison to 5 vials for the 5-dose schedule , i . e . 80% of the total volume of vaccine ( Table 1 ) . All ID regimens use less vaccine than IM regimens and are cost less per rabies death averted ( Figure 2 ) . Clinic throughput generally increases the cost-effectiveness of ID vaccination , with high throughput clinics most cost-effective and low throughput clinics least cost-effective . The only exception to this is the situation where some wastage is assumed and 0 . 5 mL vials are used , in which case the 1-week ID regimen does not increase in cost-effectiveness with throughput ( Figure S1 ) , but is still considerably more cost-effective than IM regimens . The updated TRC and the 4-site ID regimens were the most cost-effective in high throughput settings ( between $100 and $55 per life saved depending on throughput and vial size ) . While in very low throughput clinics , the 1-week ID regimen was the most cost-effective ( $160\u2013150 per life saved , Figure 1 ) . In high throughput clinics the updated TRC and 4-site ID regimens use just 40% of the volume of vaccine in comparison to preferred IM regimens ( Essen 4-dose and Zagreb ) when 0 . 5 mL vials are used and 20% of the volume when 1 mL vials are used ( Table 1 , Figure 1 ) . The cost-effectiveness of all ID regimens increases considerably when 1 mL vials are used instead of 0 . 5 mL vials ( Figure 1 ) . The estimated costs of PEP vaccination to health providers are shown for different regimens in Table 4 for a variety of throughput settings and illustrate how provision of PEP using ID regimens is considerably more economic than provision of PEP using IM regimens . When health providers charge for PEP vaccination according to the strategies described , substantial costs are recovered when using ID regimens and in most cases savings are made . The extent of savings and how these vary with clinic throughput for different ID regimens are shown in Figure 3 . Using 1 mL vials rather than 0 . 5 mL vials increases savings for all pricing strategies . Charging patients for exactly the amount of vaccine administered using the ID route results in a net loss for healthcare providers except in high throughput clinics . Charging patients per ID injection at rates slightly greater than the price of the vaccine used results in net savings in most locations ( Figure 3 shows savings for charging $2 . 5 or $3/injection assuming vials cost $10 ) . Other strategies such as charging higher rates but for the primary presentation only , or for primary and secondary presentations only , also result in significant savings for high throughput clinics and losses occur only in very low throughput clinics when 1 mL vials are used . For example , when using 1 mL vials , charging the price of a vial for each of the first 2 presentations , results in savings in clinics that receive over 15 new patients per month with all the ID regimens , whereas losses are always incurred when using 0 . 5 mL vials in lower throughput clinics ( Figure 3 ) . Similar savings are made in high throughput clinics charging a fixed price for a full PEP course when 1 mL vials are used ( illustrated by a $15 set rate , assuming a vial costs $10 , in Figure 3 ) , however , charging $15 for a full ID course ( all regimens ) is not sufficient to recuperate costs when using 0 . 5 mL vials . Extrapolations assuming use of the $15 full course of the updated TRC regimen with 1 mL vials ( the only ID regimen currently recommended by WHO ) suggest that even in countries with mainly low throughput clinics ( e . g . Tanzania ) , savings recuperated from urban centres would ensure sustainability , and in the highest throughput settings annual savings could exceed $100 , 000 in a single clinic ( Table 4 ) . Where PEP vaccination is provided free-of-charge , the Zagreb IM and the recently proposed 1-week ID regimens are most preferable for patients , who incur only indirect costs ( Table 5 ) . This is because only 3 hospital visits are required as compared to the Essen IM and the updated TRC and 4-site ID regimens , which all require 4 visits ( Table 1 ) . When patients are required to pay for PEP vaccination , the most preferable regimen for bite victims varies depending on pricing strategies and relative travel costs ( Table 5 ) . However , in terms of price , ID regimens are always preferable over IM regimens . When travel costs are low and PEP is charged per injection , the updated TRC and the 4-site ID regimens are preferable . The 1-week ID regimen is preferable when travel costs are high , and particularly when flat rates are charged for the full PEP course , rather than per injection ( Table 5 ) . We assume that high costs reduce patient compliance , which in turn reduces the effectiveness of PEP in preventing rabies and thus the cost-effectiveness of PEP . Specifically , we assume 100% compliance when patients pay $10 or less for PEP , and that for every dollar increase there is a 0 . 05% reduction in compliance ( Table 3 ) , thus the most expensive regimen ( $98 . 4 per course for the Essen 4-dose IM for patients with high travel costs , Table 5 ) , has only 42 . 8% compliance . The cost per rabies death averted decreases as the efficacy of the regimen increases , and therefore cost-effectiveness increases and a greater proportion of preventable deaths are averted ( Figure 4A & B ) . Cost-effectiveness is lowest at low levels of compliance . The proportion of deaths prevented also increases with vaccine efficacy ( Figure 4B ) . At low levels of vaccine efficacy , regimens that require 3 clinic visits ( Zagreb , 4-site ID , 1 week ID ) prevent a greater percentage of deaths than regimens that require 4 clinic visits ( Essen 4-dose , updated TRC ) . Overall , the risk of death increases with the costs of PEP as patients become less likely to comply with regimens ( Figure 4C ) . For all pricing strategies that we present , patients who live further from clinics have reduced compliance and heightened risks . When PEP vaccination is free of charge , risks are minimized , and risks are maximized when charging for IM regimens ( Figure 4C ) . \n Rabies post-exposure vaccination is essential for preventing this fatal disease but can be out of the financial reach of many bite victims . Vaccine shortages are common in developing countries and due to limited availability bite victims often need to travel long distances to obtain vaccine . Thus , patients often incur substantial costs and face dangerous delays in securing PEP and avoidable human rabies deaths occur as a direct result of poor access to affordable PEP [3] , [4] , [5] . We examined the costs of IM versus ID administration of PEP vaccine in different settings and under realistic constraints such as poor compliance . We demonstrate that ID delivery of PEP is considerably more cost-effective than IM delivery in terms of averting rabies cases and saving lives . Clinic throughput affects the capacity for vial sharing , and therefore the cost-effectiveness of ID administration relative to IM . As throughput increases , ID regimens become increasingly cost-effective , using up to 80% less vaccine ( Figure 1 ) . Yet , even clinics with relatively low throughput ( \u223c10 new patients/month ) would reduce vial use by 25% by switching from IM to ID administration of PEP . Increased use of ID regimens could therefore prevent vaccine shortages and enable wider vaccine distribution , both increasing the number of patients that can be treated and the overall accessibility of PEP . Concurrent changes in PEP costs to patients could also improve affordability , while providing incentives for compliance without compromising existing health budgets . These issues should be considered in the design of PEP policy because they could reduce the burden of rabies by increasing the availability of vaccines for the rural poor who bear the brunt of rabies in most developing countries . Our principal finding that ID administration of PEP is more cost-effective than IM administration and reduces the amount of vaccine used is important given the frequency with which PEP vaccine shortages occur at clinics in many developing countries . Savings in vaccine use are substantially larger when using equivalently priced 1 mL rather than 0 . 5 mL vials , especially in high throughput clinics because of greater vial sharing . In this situation there is no advantage to stocking a mixture of vials ( 100% of 1 mL vials is always most cost-effective ) , but should pricing change ( so that 1 mL and 0 . 5 mL vials differ in price ) , optimal stocking strategies should be evaluated as a priority . For safety reasons ( potential for contamination ) vial sharing is only possible on the day of vaccine reconstitution , even though potency remains high when properly stored [23] . Research into methods of preserving rabies vaccines and preventing contamination could therefore enable more economical use of vaccines , including production in larger volume vials . Despite policies to provide PEP free-of-charge , many bite victims need to pay to promptly obtain PEP . In the light of this , a switch to ID administration could reduce costs to bite victims . But , there are many ways to charge for PEP . Only in high throughput locations , where vials can be shared completely , could patients be charged exactly for vaccine used without clinics operating at a loss . Rates could be set proportional to clinic throughput to prevent losses and ensure cost-recovery , but this would result in inequities ( with higher throughput clinics providing cheaper PEP ) that would disadvantage patients attending lower throughput clinics , i . e . the rural poor . More equitably , patients could be charged set rates that are much lower than for IM PEP ( Table 5 ) , whilst ensuring cost recovery ( Figure 3 ) . Savings ( see Table 4 ) from higher throughput clinics could subsidize either lower throughput clinics that might operate at a loss , or the poorest patients who are unable to afford PEP ( e . g . as part of a rolling fund or an insurance system ) or even other rabies control and prevention activities . Innovative financing mechanisms could provide more affordable PEP and generate potentially high returns from high throughput clinics , but effective monitoring would be critical . Health policy aims to reduce the burden of disease , but conflicts inevitably arise between the individual interests of patients and the population-level interests of healthcare providers . Choices about which regimens are preferable depend upon whether indirect or direct costs are a greater obstacle to bite victims . When PEP is provided free-of-charge , the recently developed 1-week ID regimen and the Zagreb IM are most advantageous for patients , because they entail fewer clinic visits . But both have drawbacks as the 1-week ID regimen is not yet approved by WHO and the Zagreb regimen , which is approved by WHO , uses more vaccine . If budgets and therefore vaccine supply are limited , the 4-site , if eventually approved by WHO , and updated TRC ID regimens are most preferable . Policies need to balance these issues to reduce costs for bite victims and prevent shortages . A further consideration in PEP delivery is how to promote compliance and therefore improve the effectiveness of PEP . We assume that affordability of PEP will improve compliance and provision of PEP free-of-charge is therefore the ideal solution ( Figure 4 ) . However , when charging for PEP , flat rates that are more affordable than IM regimes ( e . g . $15 for a full course or $20 for the first two visits , see Table 2 ) might incentivise compliance , but would recuperate costs only when 1 mL vials are used . Alternatively wider distribution of vaccine ( even when charging for PEP ) could reduce indirect costs for bite-victims and improve compliance . Staying in the vicinity of a clinic rather than travelling back and forth for each scheduled vaccination might also be cheaper for bite-victims , which would apply particularly for the 1-week ID regimen ( we do not currently explore such complexities but data could inform model inputs for future analyses ) . Although the 1-week ID uses more vaccine than other ID regimens , reduced indirect costs could make it more affordable for bite-victims . This may facilitate compliance and has the added benefit of earlier complete protection reducing anxiety for bite-victims . In contrast , for the 4-dose ID regimen , the last dose of vaccine is not administered until day 90 , which could reduce compliance in comparison to other ID regimens . Further study is therefore warranted to better quantify indirect costs of obtaining PEP and to understand the major constraints to PEP access and compliance for those most in need . Incomplete and late PEP is less effective in preventing the onset of disease , but there are no data available to quantitatively compare risks to full compliance ( we were only able to explore hypothetical changes in PEP effectiveness with poor compliance ) . Contact tracing could potentially reveal more about these issues , and longitudinal serology studies could provide a useful proxy measure for immunogenicity that could be used to inform PEP policy . Despite being more economical , misperceptions about ID , the lack of strong recommendations and a profusion of complex schedules have deterred their widespread adoption . Yet our analyses show that switching from IM to ID administered PEP has benefits to patients and healthcare providers . The updated TRC is the only currently WHO approved ID regimen , but the 4-site ID regimen is also highly cost-effective and the 1-week ID has other benefits for bite-victims . Their further evaluation by WHO is clearly warranted . More generally , since ID procedures involve delivery of only small amounts of vaccine , in order to apply our findings to settings where non pre-qualified vaccines are used , rigorous evaluation of the product including manufacturing standards , safety , immunogenicity and efficacy must be prioritized . The absolute cost-effectiveness of PEP depends upon the regimen , clinic throughput , clinic overhead and costs of materials for vaccine delivery and vaccine vials . Nonetheless , our estimates suggest that PEP is more cost-effective in averting deaths than childhood immunization through the Expanded Program on Immunization ( USD$205/death averted in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia [24] ) , which is considered one of the most cost-effective health interventions available [25] . Even considering vaccine waste , the worst-case scenario for PEP cost-effectiveness is around $200/death averted ( for IM regimens ) and in high throughput clinics use of ID regimens can reduce costs to just $60/death averted . Cost-effectiveness will decline if PEP is administered to patients who are bitten by non-rabid animals . We do not currently factor this into our calculations , but positive predictive values obtained from field data in Cambodia and in Tanzania [4] , [26] suggest that PEP is largely administered to genuine rabid bite victims and that cost-effectiveness will remain high even with liberal provision of PEP [19] . Thus effective PEP delivery should be considered an extremely cost-effective investment for public health , given the current poor availability of this life saving intervention . However , rabies can only be eliminated through intervention in the animal reservoir [27] , and this is likely to be the most cost-effective way of averting human rabies deaths in the long-term [28] . Our model has several simplifications , which could be elaborated on in future . We assume that the day of the week does not affect the likelihood of presenting for PEP vaccination . But patients may be less likely to present on Sundays ( in many countries clinics providing PEP are not open on Sundays ) and/or more likely to present on Mondays or other days of the week ( e . g . after pay day ) , which may affect vial sharing . We also do not include pre-exposure vaccination . Livestock officers and extension workers involved in animal vaccinations and more at risk of animal bites should be pre-vaccinated . Pre-exposure vaccinations would likely make PEP more cost-effective ( as less vaccine is required in the event of an exposure ) and preliminary vaccinations could be coordinated to ensure effective vial sharing ( e . g . prior to dog vaccination campaigns ) . But , in general in low-income countries , such pre-vaccinated persons are rare relative to non-vaccinated bite victims . In some high-risk settings pre-vaccination of children is under consideration [29] , and our simulation framework could be useful for their further evaluation . The availability and affordability of PEP is critical in determining the burden of rabies . Incidence in resource poor countries is directly affected by the inability of bite victims to obtain PEP and obtain it promptly . Reducing the cost of PEP and preventing administration delays is therefore particularly important in resource-limited settings . The variety of PEP regimens , vial sizes , and routes of administration has also made the delivery of these life-saving vaccines unnecessarily complicated . Our results provide evidence to show that a simplification to universal ID delivery of PEP could have massive advantages in low-income countries: streamlining guidelines , reducing the volume of vaccine use , mitigating vaccine shortages and making PEP more affordable to the most vulnerable . Health workers routinely deliver childhood immunizations intradermally , so there should be no technical difficulty in switching to ID administration . ID vaccination is as safe and efficacious as IM vaccination and is well-tolerated [30] . The immense advantages of ID PEP delivery should be specifically highlighted in outbreak situations , such as those recently reported from Bali [31] and in areas where vaccine supply is limited , as considerably more bite victims can be protected using the same volume of vaccine .", "headings": ["Abstract", "Introduction", "Methods", "Results", "Discussion"], "keywords": ["public health and epidemiology/health policy", "virology/vaccines", "evidence-based healthcare/health services research and economics", "evidence-based healthcare", "infectious diseases/viral infections", "public health and epidemiology/health services research and economics", "public health and epidemiology/immunization"], "id": "journal.pntd.0000982"}

One mechanism developed by the parasite for nutrient acquisition is the attraction of host organelles to the PV . Here , we examined the exploitation of host lipid droplets ( LD ) , ubiquitous fat storage organelles , by Toxoplasma . We show that Toxoplasma replication is reduced in host cells that are depleted of LD , or impaired in TAG lipolysis or fatty acid catabolism . In infected cells , the number of host LD and the expression of host LD-associated genes ( ADRP , DGAT2 ) , progressively increase until the onset of parasite replication . Throughout infection , the PV are surrounded by host LD . Toxoplasma is capable of accessing lipids stored in host LD and incorporates these lipids into its own membranes and LD . Exogenous addition of oleic acid stimulates LD biogenesis in the host cell and results in the overaccumulation of neutral lipids in very large LD inside the parasite . To access LD-derived lipids , Toxoplasma intercepts and internalizes within the PV host LD , some of which remaining associated with Rab7 , which become wrapped by an intravacuolar network of membranes ( IVN ) . Mutant parasites impaired in IVN formation display diminished capacity of lipid uptake from host LD . Moreover , parasites lacking an IVN-localized phospholipase A2 are less proficient in salvaging lipids from host LD in the PV , suggesting a major contribution of the IVN for host LD processing in the PV and , thus lipid content release . Interestingly , gavage of parasites with lipids unveils , for the first time , the presence in Toxoplasma of endocytic-like structures containing lipidic material originating from the PV lumen . This study highlights the reliance of Toxoplasma on host LD for its intracellular development and the parasite\u2019s capability in scavenging neutral lipids from host LD . \n In mammalian cells , lipid droplets ( LD ) are cytoplasmic structures containing a diverse array of lipids and proteins . LD consist of an organic core , comprising neutral lipids ( mostly triacylglycerols ( TAG ) and cholesteryl esters ( CE ) with mixed fatty acid composition ) bounded by a monolayer of phospholipids [1] . Inserted onto the outer phospholipid monolayer are structural proteins ( e . g . , proteins of the perilipin family , such as Adipose differentiation-related protein ( ADRP ) or adipophilin ) , lipid biosynthetic enzymes ( e . g . , acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 ( DGAT2 ) , and acyl-CoA synthetase ) , lipolytic enzymes ( e . g . , adipose tissue triacylglycerol lipase ( ATGL ) and membrane-trafficking proteins ( e . g . , Rab7 , Rab18 and ARF1 ) [2\u20134] . LD display canonical lipid-related functions ranging from energy storage to lipid homeostasis . In addition , these structures are engaged in various cellular processes , depending on cell type and activation conditions , such as cell signaling during inflammation , innate immunity , RNA metabolism , cytoskeletal organization , nuclear transcription and histone modulation [5\u20137] . Pertinent to the role of LD in immune responses , LD produce inflammation mediators ( e . g . , prostaglandins and leukotrienes ) , regulate the MHC-I antigen presentation pathway , and are assembling platforms for effectors involved in interferon response [8] . Unsurprisingly , several pathogens have evolved to take advantage of host LD to favor their own survival: they target host LD for progeny assembly , or as part of an anti-immunity strategy [8\u201312] . Prominent pathogen-mediated changes to host LD include inducing LD formation , altering LD ultrastructure , modifying LD lipid and protein composition , relocating LD to the site of pathogen replication , and transferring LD content to the pathogen\u2019s intracellular compartment . Some intracellular pathogens activate host intracellular signaling pathways , leading to enhanced LD formation . For instance , Trypanosoma cruzi and Mycobacterium tuberculosis trigger LD biogenesis in macrophages through a Toll-like receptor-2-dependent mechanism [13 , 14] . Additionally , Chlamydia trachomatis and M . tuberculosis sequester host LD in their phagosome-like compartment [15\u201317] . Thus , it has been proposed that host LD-stored lipids could serve as nutrients , though the transfer of lipids derived from LD to the phagosome or bacterial cell has never been experimentally demonstrated . The protozoan parasite , Toxoplasma gondii causes life-threatening diseases , such as toxoplasmic encephalitis , in immunocompromised individuals [18] . T . gondii infects a large variety of mammalian cells wherein it resides in a self-made parasitophorous vacuole ( PV ) . The production of infectious progeny and persistence of the parasite in its host importantly rely on lipid metabolic activities . Toxoplasma acquires the necessary lipids through intricate and complex networks of synthetic and salvage pathways [19 , 20] . For instance , we previously showed that T . gondii is auxotrophic for low-density lipoprotein-derived cholesterol and retrieves this lipid from mammalian endocytic organelles [21] . Once internalized by the parasite , cholesterol can be esterified for storage in cytosolic LD by two acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferases ( ACAT ) enzymes [22 , 23] . The parasite also intercepts host cell Golgi-derived Rab14 , Rab30 and Rab43 vesicles to scavenge their sphingolipid content [24] . Thus , T . gondii largely exploits the host lipidome . Recent studies on Toxoplasma infecting macrophages and skeletal muscle cells showed an increased number of LD in the host cytoplasm up to 48 h post-infection [25 , 26] . This enhanced LD formation in Toxoplasma-infected cells correlates with reduced host microbicidal properties , such as an increased synthesis of PGE2 , a potent inhibitor of Th1 type response , and a decreased production of nitric oxide . Aside from the augmented production of eicosanoids , the propagation of lipid-rich reservoirs may be beneficial for a parasite that forages for lipids from many sources in the host cell . In this study , we explored the ability of T . gondii to exploit host LD for nutritional purposes . Our data reveal that host LD lipid content and lipolytic activities are important for the parasite\u2019s development in mammalian cells . Toxoplasma infection has a pronounced impact on host cell neutral lipid homeostasis , through changes in host LD abundance , LD intracellular distribution and host neutral lipid syntheses . We also provide morphological evidence that Toxoplasma internalizes host LD into the PV and salvages their lipid content for incorporation into membranes or , in case of excess , storage in its own LD . \n It has been shown that host LD biogenesis is stimulated in Toxoplasma-infected mouse macrophages and skeletal muscle cells 24 h and 48 h post-infection ( p . i . ) [25 , 26] . To determine if a similar effect occurs in other cell types , human fibroblasts ( HFF ) and epithelial cells ( HeLa ) were infected in vitro with Toxoplasma , and LD biogenesis was monitored throughout infection . Infected HFF at various time points were stained with BODIPY 493/503 , a lipophilic dye that specifically accumulates and fluoresces in LD , and the host LD number was assessed by fluorescence microscopy ( Fig 1A , panel I ) . The number of mammalian LD steadily increased early in infection from a median of 23 LD in uninfected cells to 34 ( 1/PV ) , 51 ( 2/PV ) and 50 ( 4/PV ) in infected cells . However , once the PV contains 8 parasites , which corresponds to ~24 h p . i . , the host LD number abruptly declined to approximately 26 per cell . The mean surface area and volume of mammalian LD per cell did not significantly differ between uninfected and infected HFF ( Fig 1A , panels II and III ) . To validate the variation in host LD numbers during a Toxoplasma infection , we measured the transcriptional levels of the gene coding for ADRP , a protein associated with the LD surface [27] ( Fig 1B ) . The expression of hsADRP transcripts increased by 1 . 5-fold at 5 h p . i . , as compared to uninfected cells , and continued increasing up to 9 h p . i . , then declined to levels similar to uninfected cells at 24 h p . i . The peak of hsADRP expression ( ~2-fold increase ) at 9 h p . i . ( Fig 1B ) , a time period when the majority of the PV contains two parasites , coincides then with the maximal number of host LD in infected cells ( Fig 1A , panel I ) . This reflects a highly dynamic status of host LD upon Toxoplasma infection , with an increased number of LD , then a decline from 24 h p . i . until parasite egress . LD formation is closely linked to the biosynthesis of neutral lipids , e . g . , cholesteryl esters ( CE ) and triacyglycerols ( TAG ) that are packaged in the LD core [28 , 29] . In mammalian cells , CE and TAG are formed via distinct biosynthetic pathways located to the ER . The final step of CE biosynthesis is catalyzed by two ACAT enzymes that esterifies cholesterol: ACAT1 synthesizes CE destined for storage in cytoplasmic LD while ACAT2 forms CE for packaging into plasma lipoproteins , respectively [30 , 31] . TAG formation is catalyzed by two DGAT enzymes that convert diacylglycerol ( DAG ) and acyl-CoA-activated fatty acid into TAG [32] . DGAT1 has a dual activity: it esterifies exogenous fatty acids taken up by cells and it acts in a recycling pathway involving the re-esterification of hydrolyzed TAG . DGAT2 is responsible for incorporating endogenously synthesized monounsaturated fatty acid into TAG , and is linked with fatty acid biosynthetic pathways , e . g . , the stearoyl-CoA desaturase ( SCD ) pathway . Upon reaching a threshold in CE and TAG concentrations within the ER bilayer , the nascent LD detaches itself from the ER [7] . Located in the cytoplasmic leaflet of the ER , DGAT2 readily diffuses onto the nascent LD and eventually resides on mature LD where it continuously produces TAG [33] . As Toxoplasma infection results in changes in host LD number , we examined whether the production of CE or TAG is modified in infected cells by monitoring the transcriptional activities of host ACAT1 , DGAT1 and DGAT2 at 5 h , 9 h and 24 h p . i . ( Fig 1C ) . A significant down-regulation of hsACAT1 expression throughout infection was observed with ~2 . 8-times fewer transcripts by 24 h p . i . , suggesting a decrease in CE synthesis in host cells . Expression levels of hsDGAT1 were also reduced in infected cells , reflecting a decrease in DAG esterification with exogenous fatty acids and/or decrease in TAG re-esterification via the recycling pathway . While hsDGAT2 expression decreased slightly 5 h p . i . , it increased significantly by 1 . 6-times 9 h p . i . , as compared to uninfected cells . This increase in hsDGAT2 expression correlates with the observed increase in host LD number ( Fig 1A , panel I ) . As DGAT2 is in part located on host LD , this suggests a local increase in TAG production in these structures . A hallmark of a Toxoplasma infection is the attraction of many host organelles to the PV [24 , 34\u201337] . As several pathogens are able to recruit LD around their vacuoles [11] , we inspected the spatial distribution of host LD in Toxoplasma-infected HFF or HeLa cells . Infected HFF were stained with BODIPY 493/503 to visualize host lipid droplets ( Fig 2A , panel I ) . In uninfected cells , LD were dispersed throughout the cytosol , or in some instances were perinuclear . In contrast in infected cells , the vast majority of LD gathered around individual PV of Toxoplasma beginning early in infection , and this perivacuolar distribution of host LD was maintained throughout infection until parasite egress . We next examined the host LD-PV interaction under conditions of enhanced LD formation . LD biogenesis can be induced in mammalian cells by adding oleic acid ( OA ) to culture medium ( Fig 2A , panel II ) or by overexpressing ADRP in cells [38] ( Fig 2B ) . Upon exogenous addition of 0 . 2 mM OA ( corresponding to ~20-fold excess OA ) , we observed a pronounced increase in host LD association with the PV in HFF , as compared to control conditions . In primary mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages ( BMDM ) or mouse embryonic fibroblasts ( MEF ) infected with Toxoplasma , host LD were also observed surrounding the PV ( S1 Fig ) . In HeLa cells overexpressing GFP-ADRP , PV were extensively enveloped with host LD harboring GFP-ADRP at their surface , as compared to uninfected cells in which GFP-ARDP-containing LD were randomly distributed in the cytosol ( Fig 2B , panel I ) . Under conditions of simultaneous OA addition and ADRP overexpression , LD became enlarged , which was more dramatic in infected cells with most of these oversized LD surrounding the PV ( Fig 2B , panel II ) . These data suggest that the attraction of host LD to the PV is a general phenotype of Toxoplasma infection in vitro . To scrutinize the host LD-PV interaction in finer detail , we conducted ultrastructural analyses of infected cells incubated with 0 . 2 mM OA ( Fig 2C ) . By EM , LD are recognizable as relatively homogenous electron-dense structures , without a membranous bilayer . We observed a substantial clustering of host LD at the PV , with LD often organized in multiple layers around the vacuole . The amassing of host LD around the PV and their closeness to the PV membrane did not encumber the physical association of host ER and mitochondria with the PV membrane [39 , 40] . The size of host LD in OA-loaded cells was measured , revealing a mean diameter of 0 . 66 \u00b1 0 . 15 \u03bcm and 1 . 04 \u00b1 0 . 56 \u03bcm of LD in uninfected and infected cells , respectively ( n = 250 LD from 15 cells per condition; p < 0 . 005 ) . Thus , these data indicate an increase in size of the mammalian LD population upon Toxoplasma infection , albeit with a greater variation . We next examined the dynamics of host LD relocation at the PV over time ( from 2 h to 32 h p . i . ) in ADRP-overexpressing HeLa cells . We considered a PV as positive for host LD association if it had greater than 70% of its perimeter ringed by host LD ( Fig 2D ) . Throughout infection , an accumulation of host LD around the PV was observed . Early in infection ( 2 h ) , only ~2% of PV were positive , however , by 8 h p . i . , thethe PV percent reached approximately 20 . Between 8 h and 24 h , the percent of positive PV increased by 10% yet the PV quadrupled in size , suggesting that the observed increase in the perivacuolar distribution of LD is likely not due to an increase in PV size . The addition of 0 . 2 mM OA amplified this phenomenon as by 24 h p . i . , ~50% of PV were positive . Jointly , these observations highlight the progressive displacement of host LD from a seemingly random location in the cytosol , to the vacuole periphery . The redistribution of host LD to the PV and the increased expression of HsDGAT2 at the onset of parasite replication suggest that host LD may play a role in supporting the intracellular development of Toxoplasma . To examine the impact of host LD on Toxoplasma infectivity in vitro , we infected mutant MEF lacking both DGAT1 and DGAT2 [41] , which were obtained from a DGAT1 and DGAT2 KO mouse [42 , 43] . These mutant cells contain few , tiny LD , as shown by BODIPY 493/503 staining , compared to parental ( WT ) MEF ( Fig 3A ) . Toxoplasma replication rates were quantified by parasite enumeration at 24 h p . i . in DGAT-deficient MEF , and a significant growth delay was observed ( Fig 3B , panel I ) . The slower replication rate of parasites in DGAT-deficient MEF ( D1D2KO ) was further confirmed by tritiated uracil incorporation into the parasites , showing a growth reduction of ~ 40% , as compared to parasites replicating in WT MEF ( Fig 3B , panel II ) . However , no gross alteration in the morphology of parasites grown in the mutant cells was apparent ( Fig 3B , panel III ) . We next wanted to assess growth defects of T . gondii across multiple lytic cycles by plaque assays comparing the parasite\u2019s development in D1D2KO MEF and WT MEF . However , this assay was technically impossible due the rapid growth of WT MEF , which filled in the lysis area created by the parasites , resulting in no detectable holes in the cell monolayer . Nevertheless , we were able to observe tiny , circular plaques at day 7 in the monolayer of D1D2KO MEF as these cells grow much slower than WT MEF , suggesting that Toxoplasma were able to some extent to complete several lytic cycles in the mutant MEF . To provide quantification of this process , we then explored the impact on Toxoplasma replication of repeated cultivation of the parasites , by serial passage , in D1D2KO MEF . We transferred parasites cultivated in D1D2KO MEF for 2 to 3 weeks to either WT or mutant MEF , and measured parasite replication after 24 h by uracil incorporation assays . Controls include parasites cultivated in HFF prior to transfer to either WT or D1D2KO MEF . Confirming our previous findings ( Fig 3B , panel II ) , we observed a ~40\u201345% growth reduction of parasites in D1D2KO MEF following cultivation in HFF ( Fig 3C , conditions I and III ) . Parasites that have been cultivated for 8 to12 passages in DGAT-deficient MEF then transferred to WT MEF were able to partially recover as their replication rate corresponded to ~75% of that of parasites cultivated in HFF prior to infection in WT MEF ( Fig 3C , condition II ) . By contrast , parasites maintained solely in DGAT-deficient MEF exhibited a growth reduction of ~60% ( Fig 3C , condition IV ) , and this replication defect was more pronounced than that of parasites cultivated only 24 h in DGAT-deficient MEF . This suggests that the presence of host LD influences parasite development as Toxoplasma maintained in DGAT-deficient MEF over several lytic cycles displays slower replication rate . In addition to their lipid cargo , T . gondii may take advantage of host LD for their lipid-metabolizing enzymes and energy substrates . Lipolysis is the biochemical pathway responsible for the catabolism of TAG , stored in LD , into glycerol and non-esterified fatty acids by lipases . The free fatty acids can subsequently be used as precursors for major lipid synthesis and membrane biogenesis . In LD , ATGL catalyzes the initial step in TAG hydrolysis , generating DAG and a fatty acid . No ATGL homolog is present in the Toxoplasma genome . To examine whether Toxoplasma exploits some lipolytic activities associated with host LD , we incubated infected cells with Atglistatin , a specific inhibitor of ATGL [44] . In cultured mammalian cells , up to 100 \u03bcM of Atglistatin inhibits lipolysis by reducing fatty acid mobilization . Incubation of infected cells with Atglistatin at different concentrations for 24 h resulted in a significant decrease in parasite replication , proportional to the drug concentration , as assessed by radioactive uracil incorporation ( Fig 3D , panel I ) . As Toxoplasma attracts both host LD and mitochondria to its PV , we next investigated if the parasite takes advantage of the liberation of fatty acids from the host LD and subsequent oxidation of these fatty acids in the host mitochondria , resulting in the generation of energy substrates and ATP . A central step in the fatty acid \u03b2-oxidation cycle is mediated by carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 ( CPT-1 ) , an integral transmembrane protein of the mitochondrial outer membrane that catalyzes the transfer of acyl moieties from CoA to carnitine prior to fatty acyl carnitine internalization into mitochondria [45] . Within the mitochondrial matrix , 3-ketoacyl coenzyme A thiolase ( 3-KAT ) is a key enzyme in the final step of fatty acid \u00df-oxidation generating acetyl-CoA [46] . T . gondii lacks both CPT-1 and 3-KAT genes . Etomoxir is an irreversible inhibitor of CPT-1 [47] while Trimetazidine is a competitive inhibitor of 3-KAT [48] . Incubation of Toxoplasma-infected cells with Etomoxir or Trimetazidine at various concentrations results in decreased parasite replication , proportional to drug concentrations ( Fig 3D , panel I ) . Microscopy observations of infected cells exposed for 24 h to 50 \u03bcM Atglistatin ( ~20% growth reduction of Toxoplasma ) , 100 \u03bcM Etomoxir or 100 \u03bcM Trimetazidine ( both causing ~40% decreased growth ) , reveal disorganized parasites within the PV , as compared to untreated conditions ( Fig 3D , panel II ) . BODIPY 493/503 staining illustrates the presence of large lipidic material in the PV lumen , accumulated between the parasites , suggesting lipid metabolic disorders . The sensitivity of Toxoplasma towards the inhibition of host ATGL , CPT-1 and 3-KAT activity suggests that the parasite may take advantage of the lipolytic activity of the host LD and products generated in the fatty acid \u03b2-oxidation cascade in host mitochondria . The redistribution and closeness of host LD to the PV membrane suggests that Toxoplasma may take advantage of mammalian LD for their lipid stores and/or metabolic properties . We performed assays to examine whether Toxoplasma is able to take up neutral lipids from host LD . In lipid trafficking studies , BODIPY-fatty acids are routinely used and have been shown to incorporate into LD and be readily metabolized by living cells to phospholipids , DAG , TAG and CE [49\u201352] . We incubated infected cells with C4-BODIPY-C9 , which has the fluorophore BODIPY 500/510 linked within the fatty acid chain , to track the internalization of this fatty acid analog into the parasite . A previous study on Toxoplasma-infected cells incubated with C4-BODIPY-C9 showed fluorescence staining associated with the parasite [53] . In our experimental system in which infected cells were incubated with C4-BODIPY-C9 premixed with 0 . 4 mM OA , a condition leading to the overaccumulation of fluorescent LD , we also detected fluorescent staining inside the parasite ( Fig 4A ) . To specifically assess whether the parasite retrieves fluorescent lipids from host LD , we pre-incubated HFF with the C4-BODIPY-C9/0 . 4 mM OA mixture for 18 h , washed away C4-BODIPY-C9 and infected with Toxoplasma for 2 h or 24 h . After 2 h of infection , no fluorescent signal was apparent within the PV or in the parasite , based on live cell microscopy ( Fig 4B ) . However , after 24 h of infection , we observed a fluorescent staining within the parasite , illustrating that Toxoplasma accumulated C4-BODIPY-C9 or lipids derived from it ( Fig 4C , panel I ) . Some fluorescent foci appeared reminiscent of parasite LD [22 , 23] , further evidenced on successive fluorescent z-slice images of an egressing parasite ( Fig 4C , panel II ) . The fluorescence staining was also observed on intracellular membranes , suggesting that the parasite can readily incorporate LD-derived lipids as building blocks into organellar membranes ( Fig 4C , panel III ) . Together , these results suggests the trafficking of C4-BODIPY-C9 from host LD to the parasite interior by 24 h p . i . Nevertheless , the possibility that the parasite internalizes C4-BODIPY-C9-derived lipids from other sources in the host cell besides LD , cannot be excluded . Therefore , to ensure that the parasite accessed and incorporated , into its PV and cytoplasm , neutral lipids originating from host LD , we devised an experimental protocol in which the non-metabolizable lipid dye BODIPY 493/503 was stored in host LD prior to and during infection . Host LD formation in HFF was stimulated by adding 0 . 4 mM OA mixed with BODIPY 493/503 for 18 h , which resulted in a plethora of fluorescent host LD ( Fig 5 ) . After washing , HFF pre-loaded with BODIPY-stained LD were infected with RFP-expressing Toxoplasma for 24 h in the presence of 0 . 2 mM OA , to pressure the host cell to maintain LD , and viewed by live or fixed microscopy . Remarkably , BODIPY 493/503 staining was observed within the parasite , mostly accumulated within their LD , and the fluorescent signal was more prominent in fixed parasites . As this staining could only have occurred if the parasite internalized fluorescent lipids derived directly from host LD prior to storage in their own LD , this data establishes that Toxoplasma is able to access lipids confined to host LD . Next , we focused on the cellular mechanism involved in the delivery of neutral lipids stored in host LD to the PV and the parasite . We previously demonstrated that T . gondii diverts and sequesters into the PV host mammalian Rab14 , Rab30 and Rab43 vesicles containing lipids [24] . In mammalian cells , several Rab GTPase proteins are detected on the LD surface , such as Rab7 involved in lipophagy [54] and Rab18 [55] . We investigated whether Rab7- or Rab18-associated LD were selectively re-routed to the PV allowing Toxoplasma access to their cargo of neutral lipids . We first confirmed that Rab7 localizes , at least in part , to LD by transfecting HFF with a plasmid containing mCherry-Rab7 and staining with BODIPY 493/503 . Partial colocalization ( PCC: 0 . 129 ) of mCherry-Rab7 and BODIPY 493/503 was observed , primarily on the surface of the LD ( yellow , positive difference from the mean ( PDM ) image ) ( Fig 6A ) . We also detected mCherry-Rab7 and BODIPY 493/503 signals partially co-localized in Toxoplasma-infected HFF ( S3 Fig ) . Upon the addition of OA , the number of foci containing the two fluorescent signals significantly increased; measurement of the fluorescence overlap was performed by counting the number of BODIPY 493/503 foci with or without mCherry-Rab7 in the presence or the absence of 0 . 2 mM OA , and a ~3-fold increase in yellow foci was calculated ( p < 0 . 005 in uninfected vs . infected cells ) . We next devised assays to search for the presence of Rab7 foci within the PV of Toxoplasma . GFP-Rab7-expressing HFF were infected with Toxoplasma for 24 h with or without addition of OA and immunostained for GRA7 , to delineate the PV membrane ( Fig 6B ) . In all conditions , several GFP-Rab7 foci were observed inside the PV , as visualized in the orthogonal view of the z-stack . The percent of PV with intravacuolar GFP-Rab7 foci significantly increased in the presence of 0 . 2 or 0 . 4 mM OA added to the medium ( Fig 6C ) . However , to rule out the possibility that these foci are Rab7-associated endocytic vesicles rather than LD , we repeated the assay on infected mCherry-Rab7-expressing HFF , stained with BODIPY 493/503 ( Fig 6D ) . Intravacuolar foci stained for both mCherry-Rab7 and BODIPY 493/503 were observed in 3D reconstructed images , shown both as an orthogonal view of a z-stack and as individual z-slice images . This indicates that these yellow foci , which correspond to bona fide host LD , were sequestered into the PV . In infected GFP-Rab18-expressing HFF , we also observed intravacuolar GFP-Rab18-positive structures ( S4A Fig ) inside ~40% of Toxoplasma PV ( S4B Fig ) . In contrast to GFP-Rab7 , there was no significant increase in the percent of PV containing Rab18 in the presence of excess OA . The observations suggest that Toxoplasma may take up LD via the recognition of Rab7 , and potentially Rab18 , which may be a mechanism by which the parasite accesses neutral lipids stored in host LD . The above observations prompted us to conduct ultrastructural studies to ascertain the presence host LD inside the PV of Toxoplasma , and to provide detailed information on their ultrastructure and specific location inside the vacuole . HFF were infected with Toxoplasma for 24 h and then fixed in the presence of malachite green , an organic compound which retains lipid elements [56] , resulting in the preservation and enhanced staining of lipid-rich structures such as LD ( Fig 7A , panel I ) . In many instances , we observed several host LD not only in close proximity to the PV membrane , but also protruding into the PV . In HFF infected with Toxoplasma for 24 h incubated with 0 . 2 mM OA , even more host LD were observed bulging against the vacuolar membrane ( Fig 7A , panel II ) . Examination of the PV content reveals the presence of LD inside the vacuole ( Fig 7B ) , some of them surrounded by the PV membrane ( Fig 7B , panel I ) . These LD displayed all the features of LD found in the host cytoplasm , including a thin phospholipid monolayer , and a similar size , electron-density and shape ( S5 Fig ) , confirming that host LD were translocated from the host cytosol to the intravacuolar space . The PV lumen contains thin tubules organized in a dense network named the intravacuolar network ( IVN ) . The IVN is initially secreted by the parasite [57] and then expanded through the salvage of host lipids by the parasite via an unknown mechanism [58] . It has been proposed that this network may be involved in nutrient uptake [59] , or parasite protein targeting to the PV membrane [60] . Interestingly , host LD internalized into the PV were wrapped by tubules of the IVN , as illustrated for 3 LD ( Fig 7B , panels II and III ) . The wrapping of host LD within the membranous structures of the IVN urged us to investigate whether this network is important for lipid availability to the parasite through the sequestration of host LD in the PV . To test this hypothesis , we exploited a mutant parasite lacking two main structural proteins located to the IVN , GRA2 and GRA6 , which are both essential for the formation and stabilization of the IVN [61] . We first examined the intracellular distribution of host LD in fibroblasts infected with the double knockout \u0394gra2\u0394gra6 in the presence of 0 . 2 mM OA . Host LD recruitment around the PV of the mutant was observed ( Fig 8A , panel I ) , similarly as for WT parasites ( Fig 2A , panel II ) . Next , we looked at the capability of the parasite mutant to store lipids and form LD by staining infected cells with BODIPY 493/503 . Quantification of the volume of the green fluorescent signal within individual parasites reveal significantly less staining ( ~50% reduction ) in the \u0394gra2\u0394gra6 mutant , as compared to WT parasites ( Fig 8A , panel II ) . The ability of the \u0394gra2\u0394gra6 strain to retrieve lipids directly from host LD was then probed using the protocol as described in Fig 5 . Mutant parasites were capable of scavenging host LD-derived neutral lipids , albeit to a much lower extent than WT parasites , as evidenced by microscopic observations illustrating very spare and small LD ( Fig 8B , panel I ) . Quantification of the fluorescent signal within the mutant reveals BODIPY 493/503 intensity ~ 4-times lower than calculated for WT parasites ( Fig 8B , panel II ) . We previously characterized the properties of a phospholipase A2 enzyme ( TgLCAT ) , a dense granule protein that is secreted by Toxoplasma into the PV and is associated with the IVN post-secretion [59] . One attractive hypothesis is that the IVN may serve as a platform for degradative or lipolytic activities mediated by TgLCAT , thus for the processing of host nutrient-enriched structures sequestered into the PV , to cover the parasite\u2019s nutritional needs ( manuscript in preparation , JDR , SJN , KE , CP , EH , RH and IC ) . We previously generated a parasite mutant lacking TgLCAT ( \u0394lcat ) , which exhibited growth defects both in vitro and in mice , and a parasite complemented strain overexpressing TgLCAT ( \u0394lcat::LCAT ) , which was more virulent in mice than WT parasites [59] . In fibroblasts infected with either \u0394lcat parasites or TgLCAT-overexpressing parasites , host LD also clustered around the PV ( Fig 8A , panel I ) . Additionally , BODIPY 493/503 staining of infected HFF show that these two parasites strains possessed LD ( Fig 8A , panel II ) . However , by tracking the incorporation of BODIPY 493/503 preloaded in host LD into these parasite strains , a weak BODIPY fluorescent staining was observed in the \u0394lcat mutant ( Fig 8B , panel I ) , concomitant with a significant ~4- and 5-fold reduction in intraparasitic BODIPY volume as compared to WT and TgLCAT overexpressor parasites , respectively ( Fig 8B , panel II ) . TgLCAT-overexpressing parasites exhibited large LD which stained with BODIPY 493/503 ( Fig 8B , panel I ) , however , BODIPY volume quantification revealed no significant difference with WT parasites ( Fig 8B , panel II ) . All together , these results suggest that the IVN and , at least , one lipase associated to this network are implicated in the processing of host LD trapped into the PV , which would result in lipid availability for the parasites . Exogenously added OA at physiological concentrations up to 0 . 5 mM leads to a net synthesis of TAG and activation of the TAG/free fatty acid cycling , which protect mammalian cells against lipotoxicity [62] . In our system using fibroblasts , addition of 0 . 2 mM OA to the medium of a confluent layer of cells for 24 h resulted in an increase in transcription of hsADRP by 3 . 9-fold , hsDGAT1 by 1 . 7-fold , and hsDGAT2 by 1 . 9-fold , as compared to untreated cells ( S6 Fig ) . No statistically significant increase in either hsACAT1 or hsATGL gene expression was observed . Next , we examined the response of Toxoplasma to excess OA added to the medium and/or to excess TAG in host LD . Intracellular Toxoplasma is able to divert various fatty acids present in its environment [53 , 63 , 64] . Upon the exogenous addition of excess OA during infection , the parasite may salvage OA as free fatty acid and/or as OA-containing lipids from many host cell compartments including LD . First , we investigated the extent to which Toxoplasma was able to take up OA packed in host LD . LD formation was triggered by incubating HFF in either 0 . 1 mM or 0 . 4 mM OA , both mixed with traces of [3H]OA , for 24 h . Cells were washed and infected with Toxoplasma , and 24 h or 36 h p . i , parasite egress was induced using the calcium ionophore A23817 [65] . Parasites were then collected and purified from cellular debris before assessing their radioactivity by scintillation counting ( Fig 9A ) . Tritiated material was incorporated into Toxoplasma proportionally to the OA concentrations and the infection times , revealing the avidity of the parasite to divert large amounts of lipids accumulated in its environment . Like many organisms , T . gondii encodes enzymes to form TAG and CE for storage in its own LD [22 , 23 , 63] . In contrast to mammalian cells , Toxoplasma possesses two ACAT enzymes ( TgACAT1 and TgACAT2 ) that are both involved in producing CE for storage in LD . While TgACAT1 preferentially utilizes palmitoyl-CoA , TgACAT2 has broader fatty acid specificity and produces more CE . The parasite expresses only one DGAT , TgDGAT responsible for all its TAG synthesis . Second , we examined whether T . gondii activates its enzymatic machinery for TAG and CE synthesis in order to counter the uptake of excess OA by measuring the expression levels of TgACAT1 , TgACAT2 and TgDGAT in intracellular parasites exposed to excess OA for 12 h or 24 h . Minor , statistically insignificant variations were observed in all three transcripts at 12 h p . i . as compared to control conditions without OA addition ( Fig 9B , panel I ) . However , at 24 h p . i . , a significantly increase in TgACAT2 ( 1 . 7-fold ) and TgDGAT ( 1 . 8-fold ) expression was observed . As T . gondii salvages exogenous OA proportionally to its extracellular concentration , we extended our transcriptional analysis to intracellular parasites exposed to 0 . 4 mM OA for 24 h , and unsurprisingly , we detected higher levels of TgACAT2 and TgDGAT transcripts under this condition ( Fig 9B , panel II ) . Unsaturated fatty acids , such as OA , are synthesized from saturated fatty acids by the enzymatic activity of desaturases [66]; for example , the SCD enzyme ( \u0394-9 fatty acid desaturase ) catalyzes the synthesis of monounsaturated fatty acids including OA , via the introduction of a single double bond [67\u201369] . In mammalian cells , intracellular levels of fatty acids are controlled , in part , by SCD . The addition of 0 . 1 mM OA in the medium down-regulates SCD mRNA expression in many cells types , excluding adipocytes in which SCD expression is associated with lipogenesis induction and TAG storage [70\u201373] . This leads to the question of whether Toxoplasma encodes a SCD orthologue and , if so , how its expression is controlled in the presence of excess OA . Genome searches in T . gondii reveal the presence of a gene coding for a single SCD ( \u0394-9 fatty acid desaturase; TGME49_238950 in www . toxodb . org ) , potentially involved in the synthesis of stearate to oleate . To examine whether TgSCD is regulated in the presence of excess OA , we measured the transcription of TgSCD in intracellular parasites incubated with excess OA . TgSCD transcription was upregulated by 1 . 65- and 2 . 7-fold in the presence of 0 . 2 and 0 . 4 mM OA respectively , which is analogous to the response of adipocytes exposed to excess OA . To verify whether the upregulated transcriptional activities of TgACAT2 and TgDGAT in parasites exposed to excess OA correlate with increased activities of ACAT and DGAT enzymes , we measured the amounts of neutral lipids produced by intracellular parasites following exposure to 0 . 2 and 0 . 4 mM OA for 24 h . In an initial thin layer chromatography ( TLC ) analysis of parasite lipid extracts separating the least polar lipids , higher amounts of TAG were detected for T . gondii incubated with excess OA , with an ~3- and ~4 . 5-fold increase for 0 . 2 and 0 . 4 mM OA , respectively , as compared to control condition ( Fig 9C , panel I ) ; no quantitative changes were observed for cholesterol among experimental conditions . In a second TLC migration where a lower-polarity solvent was used to separate apolar components , higher quantities of CE were detected for T . gondii incubated with excess OA , with an ~1 . 5- and ~2 . 5-fold increase with 0 . 2 and 0 . 4 mM OA , respectively; slightly higher amounts of monoacylglycerols ( MAG ) and DAG were also observed with 0 . 2 or 0 . 4 mM ( Fig 9C , panel II ) . In conclusion , OA salvaged by T . gondii is mainly converted to TAG and CE , which is consistent with the upregulation of TgACAT2 and TgDGAT in the presence of excess OA . It remains possible , however , that the large amounts of TAG detected in the parasites may also be salvaged as TAG molecular species from host LD , instead of OA salvaged and converted to TAG within the parasite . As our TLC analyses indicate an accumulation of various neutral lipids into Toxoplasma following excess OA incubation and that the majority of neutral lipids in many organisms are predisposed to be stored in LD , we stained infected cells with BODIPY 493/503 to inspect the parasite\u2019s lipid stores . Under normal culture conditions , each parasite contains an average of 2 LD with a mean diameter of ~0 . 2 \u03bcm [22] . However , after incubation with 0 . 2 and 0 . 4 mM OA for 24 h , we detected up to 8 fluorescent puncta within the parasite ( Fig 10A ) . At 0 . 4 mM OA , the fluorescent signals were more intense and the puncta were larger , occupying a large volume of the parasite\u2019s cytosol ( Fig 10A ) ; some of these fluorescent puncta were as large as host LD , with a diameter up to ~0 . 6 \u03bcm . These large fluorescent structures may correspond to either several immense LD or a cluster of many smaller LD . To resolve this issue , we conducted EM studies on infected cells incubated with 0 . 4 mM OA . We observed a gathering of many small LD ( up to 20 per parasite ) in the cytosol more frequently than isolated gigantic LD ( Fig 10B , panels I and II ) . Thus , in response to excess OA , the parasite is able to stimulate LD biogenesis for the storage of large quantities of neutral lipids . The PV lumen contains an IVN of tubules that are secreted en bloc by the parasite into the PV [57] . A previous study suggests that host lipids are also major contributors to the IVN [58] . To determine whether excess OA affects the IVN , we analyzed by EM the PV content of parasites infecting cells incubated with 0 . 2 mM OA . In the absence of added OA , the IVN remains confined to the middle of the PV , and sometimes between a few parasites but it does not fill the entire available space within the PV [57] . By contrast , in the presence of 0 . 2 mM OA , the IVN dramatically expands and occupies the entire vacuolar space available between parasites ( Fig 10C , panel I ) . Higher magnification images of PV in the presence of excess OA illustrate the extremely compacted structure of the IVN that is composed of remarkably long , intertwined tubules ( Fig 10C , panel II ) . These findings suggest that part of the OA salvaged by Toxoplasma is incorporated into the IVN , contributing to the dramatic expansion of this network . Regarding endocytic mechanisms for macromolecule acquisition , Toxoplasma is an intriguing organism since no internalization gates have been identified so far for this organism . Thus , the question remains as to whether T . gondii is able to incorporate large extracellular material from the PV lumen into an internal membrane system . Surprisingly , in our in-depth scrutiny of the membranous structures of Toxoplasma following exposure to excess OA ( 0 . 2 mM ) , we noticed one very large invagination of the parasite\u2019s plasma membrane . This invaginated structure had a narrow neck and a diameter of , on average , 250 nm and was observed on many parasites ( Fig 11A , panels I to III , corresponding to 3 different parasites; S7 Fig ) . This open structure was usually located at the anterior pole of the parasite , close to the apex , and was never present on dividing parasites . This invagination was clearly distinct from the micropore , a small static cup-shaped 20-nm pit of the plasma membrane [74] , by its larger size and more post-nuclear localization . In addition , the structure and dimensions of the micropore remained unchanged upon OA addition , ruling out the possibility of micropore enlargement and transformation into this invagination ( S8 Fig ) . The content of the invaginations was identical to the PV milieu , indicating a connection between these pits and the PV lumen . The cytoplasmic surface of these invaginations was also coated with a radiating , bristle-like structure ( Fig 11A , arrow in panel I ) , reminiscent of the coat of specialized invaginations involved in endocytosis , ( e . g . , clathrin-coated pits or caveolae ) , indicating that these invaginations are not exocytic cups . We also identified several cytoplasmic organelles containing material ( e . g . , membrane whorls ) morphologically similar to the material present in the PV ( Fig 11B , green arrowheads in panels I-III ) , which would be suggestive of endocytic vesicles ( Fig 11B , red arrowheads in panels I-III ) . To provide further evidence towards the potential presence of an endocytic network within Toxoplasma , we performed an immunogold staining on intracellular Toxoplasma using antibodies against SAG1 , a plasma membrane marker ( Fig 11C , panel I ) . This would allow us to determine whether the cytoplasmic vesicles containing PV material detected in the parasite are derived from the plasma membrane . Several intracellular vesicles containing SAG1 on their limiting membrane were observed in parasites incubated with OA ( Fig 11C , panels II and III ) . These SAG1-positive vesicles cannot correspond to exocytic vesicles due to their excessive size and their absence within parasites grown under normal ( feeding ) conditions . Quantitative analysis of cytoplasmic vesicles either containing PV material or SAG1 on their membrane reveal a dramatic increase in the number of these vesicles in OA-loaded vs . control parasites ( Fig 11D ) . In fact , more than 96% of control parasites did not show any intracytoplasmic SAG1-positive structures . These observations may represent the first evidence of an endocytic event associated with an intravesicular system within Toxoplasma . Despite these cytoplasmic vesicles being predominantly detected under conditions of lipid gavage , they may be physiologically relevant and potentially involved in nutrient uptake and delivery to the parasite\u2019s cytoplasm . \n Toxoplasma gondii needs to salvage many essential metabolites , including lipids , from host cells to replicate and produce infectious progeny [75] . This parasite has evolved unique strategies to access the content of host organelles , which represent potential reservoirs of nutrients . For example , Toxoplasma intercepts host vesicular transport pathways , e . g . , endo-lysosomes filled with LDL-cholesterol and Golgi Rab vesicles loaded with sphingolipids , and retrieves their lipid cargo [21 , 24 , 76] . Among lipid-enriched structures present in mammalian cells , lipid droplets ( LD ) represent an opportune source of various neutral lipids for any lipid scavengers . In this study , we demonstrated that Toxoplasma exploits host LD by relocating them to the PV and salvaging neutral lipids stored in these structures . Along with the exploitation of cytokines and lipoxins present in host LD as previously shown [9 , 25 , 26 , 77] , Toxoplasma also targets host LD for their neutral lipid stores . Additionally , we provide evidence that host LD are important for parasite infectivity: first , Toxoplasma growth is reduced in mutant MEF largely depleted of LD via the genetic ablation of DGAT1 and DGAT2 ( D1D2KO ) ; and second , parasites repetitively cultivated in D1D2KO cells , partially regain their growth capability when transferred to WT MEF . During a Toxoplasma infection , the number of LD in the host cell fluctuates . Initially , the host LD population progressively increases , with a peak coincident with the first round of parasite replication ( ~8 h post-invasion ) . At this time , the global distribution of host LD is also prominently modified as many host LD cluster around the PV , and the transcription of host DGAT2 is concomitantly upregulated , suggesting a stimulation of TAG synthesis in LD . After that period of time , the host LD number declines and hsDGAT2 expression decreases but the vast majority of host LD remain accumulated around the PV . These changes in the cycle of host LD ( biogenesis vs . breakdown for lipolysis ) , the distribution of host LD and the expression levels of DGAT2 on LD reflect a highly dynamic status of host neutral lipid metabolism during infection . These significant changes may be driven by Toxoplasma ensuring the parasite\u2019s survival and replication ( e . g . , modulation of immune processes and nutrient acquisition ) , but they could also be part of a host cell defense mechanism in response to parasite-mediated lipid imbalances as LD are uniquely responsive to changes in lipid homeostasis . How these processes are accomplished awaits further investigation . Host LD overwhelmingly concentrate around the PV of Toxoplasma , a phenomenon that is amplified upon excess OA . The location of host LD near the PV membrane may benefit the parasite for the specific lipid content of these structures . For example , host LD that contain large amounts of esterified cholesterol , may act as an alternative source of cholesterol for T . gondii to endocytic organelles [21] . In fact , the parasite genome contains a potential lipid esterase ( www . toxodb . org; TGME49_249350 ) , that may de-esterify CE obtained from host LD to liberate cholesterol . In a similar manner , mammalian LD interact with many organelles for the exchange of materials [78] . LD-ER contact sites serve as conduits for the transport of phospholipids and proteins/enzymes with metabolic or signaling functions on LD . Trafficking of fatty acids also occurs from LD to mitochondria and peroxisomes , for catabolism through \u03b2-oxidation , and bidirectional phospholipid transport exists between LD and mitochondria . During lipophagy , physical contacts between LD and lysosomes occur , exemplified by the transfer of Rab7 to LD; by analogy , in the presence of excess OA , we observed an increase in the percent of PV containing Rab7 foci , with some foci corresponding to LD harboring Rab7 at their surface . Toxoplasma may attract and retain host LD to its PV not just for their lipid content but also to take advantage of the enzymatic activities associated with LD . To this point , the parasite is sensitive to the inhibition of host ATGL activity via Atglistatin treatment [44] in a dose-dependent manner . This implies that the parasite may be affected by disruptions in the release of fatty acids and/or DAG from host LD . The parasite lacks an ATGL homolog , making host ATGL the sole target of Atglistatin , however , unintended effects of Atglistatin on off-target molecules in the parasite cannot be excluded . Further investigations would be required to ascertain whether Toxoplasma benefits from the local ATGL-mediated lipolysis of TAG occurring at the LD surface and salvages free fatty acids liberated from the host LD . Free fatty acids liberated from LD can be transported to the mitochondria for complete oxidation , resulting in ATP production . As Toxoplasma attracts both host LD and mitochondria to its PV , it is plausible that the parasite may then take advantage of products generated in the fatty acid \u03b2-oxidation cascade occurring in the host mitochondria . In support to this hypothesis is the parasite growth reduction in cells impaired in fatty acyl-CoA transfer to carnitine after exposure to Etomoxir [47] and in cells defective in acetyl-CoA generation from fatty acid oxidation after treatment with Trimetazidine [48] . A key aspect in the process of \u03b2-oxidation , which feeds the TCA cycle , is the transport of free fatty acids into the mitochondrion . However , the genome of Toxoplasma lacks homologs of carnitine palmitoyltransferases . In addition , no genes involved in the \u03b2-oxidation process could be identified in the Toxoplasma genome ( e . g . , acyl-CoA synthetases , mitochondrial fatty acid binding proteins , FAD-dependent acyl-CoA dehydrogenases , 3-ketoacyl coenzyme A thiolase ) , thus making the parasite unable to produce ATP via this pathway . These genomic analyses are further supported by metabolic studies showing that glucose and glutamine , and not fatty acids , are the only sources of precursors for the TCA cycle in Toxoplasma , and branched-chain ketoacid dehydrogenase , an enzyme localized to the mitochondrion , is likely the source of acetyl-CoA [79] . Further investigations using Type II strains of Toxoplasma that do not recruit host mitochondria to the PV , may provide insight into a potential functional coupling of host LD and mitochondria . Finally , LD within activated macrophages , e . g . , in the context of metabolic diseases or bacterial and parasitic infections , associate with phagosomes and discharge their content , e . g . , arachidonate , into the phagosomal lumen [80 , 81] . Many intracellular pathogens ( e . g . , Trypanosoma cruzi , Leishmania amazonensis , Mycobacteria , Chlamydia trachomatis ) attract host LD to their phagosomal compartment and engulf them intact , by unknown mechanisms . For C . trachomatis , at least one molecular player involved in host LD recognition has been identified: the inclusion membrane protein IncA that binds to host ADRP at the LD surface [15] . Although the PV of Toxoplasma does not share any characteristics with a phagosome , Toxoplasma also internalizes host LD into the PV lumen , suggesting a common tactic shared by several intravacuolar pathogens to exploit LD cargoes . The detection of Rab7-associated LD around and within the PV of T . gondii complements our previous study that has highlighted that the parasite is able to divert host Rab-labeled vesicles from the Golgi apparatus and sequester them into the PV lumen to retrieve their sphingolipid content [24] . This suggests that the parasite expresses proteins at the PV membrane that interact with host Rab proteins or their effectors . The re-routing and trapping of host LD inside the PV may in part explain the decline in the host LD number from 24 h p . i . as these structures may be consumed by the parasite . In fact , this hypothesis is supported by morphological evidence illustrating host LD often wrapped by the tubules of the IVN , a vacuolar network proposed to be involved in nutrient uptake . The IVN is initially generated from proteins and lipids secreted by the parasite and is subsequently modified by lipids scavenged from the host cell [57 , 58] . The functionality of the IVN in nutrient accessibility for the parasites was demonstrated by the decreased ability of \u0394gra2\u0394gra6 parasites to salvage lipids from host LD . The PV lumen of these mutant parasites is indeed largely devoid of vesicles derived from the host cell ( manuscript in preparation , JDR , SJN , KE , CP , EH , RH and IC ) . Of importance , the \u0394gra2 mutant is less virulent in animals , ascertaining an important role for the IVN in Toxoplasma infectivity [82] . We previously characterized a lipase , TgLCAT , which exhibits strong phospholipase A2 activity leading to the production of lysophospholipids that disrupt membranes , and localizes to the tubules of the IVN [59] . This enzyme may help in degrading the lipid monolayer of the host LD trapped inside the PV , resulting in the release of neutral lipids available for the parasite . This assumption is strongly supported by a reduced association lipids originating from host LD with \u0394lcat mutant parasites . Under conditions that stimulate host LD biogenesis , such as the exogenous addition of excess OA , Toxoplasma continuously salvages OA and/or lipids derived from the host cell\u2019s metabolism of OA , resulting in an overaccumulation of various neutral lipid species . Similarly to mammalian cells , the parasite diverts excess lipids to neutral lipids in LD as an initial protective response against lipotoxic stress [83] . In response to excess OA , Toxoplasma upregulates a gene encoding DGAT , but unlike mammalian cells , it also increases transcriptional activities of cholesterol esterifying genes ( TgACAT2 ) ; previously , Toxoplasma was shown to activate its ACAT genes also upon excess cholesterol in the medium [22] . Thus , efficient storage capacities for the prevention of lipotoxicity are essential for Toxoplasma survival . To this point , we previously demonstrated that a T . gondii strain lacking the DGAT gene was not viable , and parasites lacking either ACAT gene had severe growth defects whereas a double ACAT deletion was lethal [22 , 23 , 63] . Moreover , under conditions of lipid depletion ( e . g . , in cholesterol-free medium ) , the parasite relies on its cholesteryl ester store to survive [21] , further underscoring the essentiality of neutral lipid stores for parasite development and infectivity . As Toxoplasma infects many cell types in the mammalian host , all of which vary in their lipid stores ( e . g . , abundant in intestinal and skeletal muscle; scarce in neurons [7] ) , it must adapt to these heterogeneous environments by modulating genes involved in lipid uptake and storage . Concomitant with increased TgDGAT expression , the parasite upregulates an SCD gene orthologue coding for a lipogenic enzyme in part of a de novo fatty acid biosynthetic pathway , further increasing TAG production . The massive accumulation of LD , mainly filled with TAG and CE , in Toxoplasma in the presence of excess OA is suggestive of both an uncontrolled uptake of exogenous lipids by the parasite and its unrestricted capacity in storing surplus lipids in LD which occupy a large volume in the parasite\u2019s cytosol . Similarly , adipocytes , which have evolved to stockpile lipids and energy in times of nutrient abundance , also upregulate SCD in the presence of excess lipids and form large size LD [69] . Lipotoxicity occurs , in pathologic states such as obesity , when the storage capacity for lipids is exceeded , leading to the hydrolysis of TAG pools and the increase of cellular concentrations of free fatty acids and other toxic lipids . In various animal models of obesity , SCD activity is abnormally elevated in the adipose tissue [69] . Most of non-adipocyte cells exposed to OA concentrations up to 0 . 5 mM are able to control the influx of fatty acids by storing TAG in LD and regulating TAG lipolysis and free fatty acid re-esterification . The parasite\u2019s apparent gluttony for host OA and OA-derived lipids may place it at risk for lipotoxicity if its lipid storage threshold is reached at OA concentrations lower than 0 . 5 mM . During our investigations into the morphology and membrane structure of Toxoplasma upon exposure to excess OA , we observed a large , well-structured invagination at the parasite\u2019s plasma membrane , always located at the anterior pole of the parasite . One possible role for this structure would be its involvement in endocytosis . T . gondii has a dynamic acidified organelle , named VAC that contains cathepsin proteases implicated in protein degradation [84] . Strangely , no endocytic pit has been morphologically identified in T . gondii . The genome of Toxoplasma contains few homologues coding for proteins involved in an endocytic machinery , including AP2 complex , and the light and heavy chains of clathrin , but the parasite neither expresses these proteins at the plasma membrane nor forms clathrin-coated pits [85] . No caveolin homologues are present in the parasite genome , precluding also the existence of caveolae pits at the plasma membrane . However , the invagination detected upon excess OA incubation , which was distinct from the static micropore [74] , is decorated with a regular cytoplasmic coat , morphologically reminiscent of mammalian clathrin-coated pits involved in receptor-mediated endocytosis . In addition , our EM images illustrate the presence of several cytoplasmic vesicles filled with heterogeneous material morphologically similar to that visible in the PV lumen . Moreover , the intracytoplasmic vesicles contain SAG1 on their limiting membrane , suggesting that the parasite is endowed with endocytic capability to internalize material from the PV lumen into a membranous network derived from its plasma membrane . These vesicles are unlikely not involved in exocytosis due to their excessive size and their occurrence in parasites only upon excess lipid availability . Additionally , the sole detection of these structures upon addition of 0 . 2 mM OA suggests that endocytic processes may be particularly fast in this parasite , thus impeding the trackability of these endocytic structures under normal ( feeding ) conditions . Further investigation on these novel structures , including the identification of the molecular components may provide additional information on their function . If these structures are indeed involved in endocytosis , it would divulge how the parasite internalizes and digests material , including host lipids , from the cellular environment . \n No animals have been used in this study .

The \u0394lcat and \u0394lcat::LCAT overexpressor parasites were generated previously in our laboratory [59] . The parasites were propagated in vitro by serial passage in monolayers of HFF [88] . Under specific treatments , T . gondii growth was assayed either by parasite enumeration per PV or [3H]uracil incorporation assays . In the latter , MEF or HFF were grown until confluency in 24-well plates prior to infection with 1x105 parasites for 20 h at 37\u00b0C in D-MEM ( for MEF ) or \u03b1-MEM ( for HFF ) . Cells were then incubated with 1 \u03bcCi of [3H]uracil for 4 h at 37\u00b0C and the samples were processed as described [88] . In one set of replication assays , parasites were passaged in D1D2KO MEF for up to 12 serial passages . Confluent HFF were infected with Toxoplasma for 30 minutes , followed by PBS washes to remove extracellular parasites , then incubated with 0 . 2 mM OA for various times . RNA was extracted using RNeasy Minikit ( Qiagen , Valencia , CA ) , according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol . The concentration was determined on a NanoDrop 1000 Spectrophotometer ( Thermo Scientific , Waltham , MA ) .

Enumeration of total host LD identified by staining with BODIPY 493/503 in cells infected at various time points was performed using the \u201cFind Object\u201d tool in Volocity software , and host LD average surface area and volume were calculated . If \u226570% of total host LD in the host cell were clustered around the PV , the PV was marked as positive , and plotted as such in a histogram . Infected HFF , pretreated with 0 . 4 mM OA or not , were incubated with either 40 \u03bcM of C4-BODIPY-C9 or BODIPY 493/503 for 24 h , thoroughly washed with PBS , then chased for 2 h in \u03b1-MEM medium . Cells with pre-loaded BODIPY-stained host LD or C4-BODIPY-C9-stained host LD were infected with Toxoplasma ( WT , RFP-RH or mutant parasites ) at the indicated times prior to fixation for immunostaining or live cell imaging . In some assays , 0 . 2 mM of OA was added to the medium during Toxoplasma infections to ensure host LD maintenance in cells . For the quantification of basal LD stores in the parasite , and the neutral lipid uptake from host cell LD by various Toxoplasma strains , Volocity software was used to measure the sum intensity of the BODIPY 493/503 signal in PV ( n > 30 PV per biological replicate ) . The sum intensity was then divided by the number of parasites within the PV to attain an averaged LD volume per parasite , measured in \u03bcm3 . All quantifications were done in biological triplicates , and the means of means were plotted . [3H]oleic acid was mixed with 100 mM of OA in ethanol , evaporated by N2 , resuspended in 100 \u03bcl DMSO , and mixed with 900 \u03bcl of 7% fatty acid free BSA to reach a final concentration of 10 mM [3H]OA . HFF were seeded in 24-well plates and incubated with 0 . 1 or 0 . 4 mM [3H]OA to induce the formation of host LD containing radioactive OA . Excess [3H]OA was thoroughly washed from the medium and the cells were infected with Toxoplasma for 24 h or 36 h . The calcium ionophore A23187 ( 20 \u03bcM ) was added to the cells to chemically induce Toxoplasma egress . The parasites were purified from the host cell debris using size exclusion columns ( PD-10 desalting columns , GE Healthcare ) , followed by 3 rounds of washes . The radioactivity specifically associated with the parasite fraction was determined by scintillation counting ( Multipurpose Scintillation Counter , Beckman , Brea , CA ) and cpm values were normalized to the protein concentration of the sample using a Biorad Protein Assay ( Biorad , Hercules , CA ) . These assays were graphed according to the means of means of radioactivity in cpm per mg in Excel ( Microsoft ) . The GFP-Rab7 was kindly provided by Craig Roy ( Yale University , School of Medicine , New Haven , CT ) and the mCherry Rab7 was a gift Anne Hamacher-Brady ( Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health , Baltimore , MD ) . The EGFP-Rab18 construct was acquired from the Plasmid Repository Addgene ( plasmid #49550 ) . HFF were used for transfections using the Amaxa nucleofector kit V according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol ( Lonza , Basel , Switzerland ) . Cells were transfected with 2 . 5 \u03bcg of plasmid DNA and left to recover overnight prior to infection with Toxoplasma for 30 minutes at 37\u00b0C , cascade-washed with PBS to remove extracellular parasites , and incubated for 24 h at 37\u00b0C . Egressed parasites ( < 40\u201372 h infection times ) from cells incubated with 0 , 0 . 2 or 0 . 4 mM OA were spun down at 280 x g then resuspended in 3 ml of PBS , followed by sequential passaging through 20- , 22- and 27-gauge syringe needles at room temperature . The parasites were purified from the host cell debris using PD-10 desalting columns and protein concentration was determined using the bicinchoninic acid assay [89] . Total lipids from the same amount of purified parasites between the 3 experimental conditions ( 5x107 parasites ) were extracted with chlorofom:methanol:water ( 10:10:3 , v/v/v ) , dried under liquid N2 , and resuspended in chloroform . Lipids were fractionated by thin layer chromatography in petroleum ether:diethyl ether:acetic acid ( 80:20:1 , v/v/v ) or hexane:diethyl ether:acetic acid ( 90:10:1 , v/v/v ) on TLC Silica Gel 60 plates ( Merck , Gibbsburg , NJ ) run with lipid standards , visualized with iodine vapor , and band intensity of TAG and CE were measured by densitometry . Immunofluorescence assays ( IFA ) on cells fix with 4% formaldehyde ( Polysciences , Warrington , PA ) plus 0 . 02% glutaraldehyde in PBS and permeabilize with 0 . 3% TritonX-100 was performed as described previously [24] . Coverslips were mounted using ProLong Diamond Antifade Mountant ( Life Technologies ) to minimize bleaching during microscopy observations . Cells were viewed with a Nikon Eclipse 90i equipped with an oil-immersion plan Apo 100x NA 1 . 4 objective and a Hamamatsu GRCA-ER camera ( Hamamatsu Photonics , Hamamatsu , Japan ) . Optical z-sections with 0 . 2-\u03bcm spacing were acquired using Volocity software ( PerkinElmer , Waltham , MA ) . The images were deconvolved using an iterative restoration algorithm and the registry was corrected using Volocity software . The positive product of the differences of the mean ( PDM ) images were calculated using Volocity software , which was also used to adjust brightness levels , cropping and resizing of the images obtained . Images of PV shown are representative of at least 20 PV . For transmission EM , HFF cells infected with Toxoplasma RH strain for 24 h ( with or without OA ) were fixed in 2 . 5% glutaraldehyde ( EM grade; Electron Microscopy Sciences , Hatfield , PA ) in 0 . 1 M sodium cacodylate buffer ( pH 7 . 4 ) for 1 h at room temperature , and processed as described [90] before examination with a Philips CM120 Electron Microscope ( Eindhoven , the Netherlands ) under 80 kV . In one set of Toxoplasma-infected cells , malachite green was added during the aldehyde fixation and the osmium post-fixation to stain lipid bodies [56] . For immunoelectron microscopy ( immunoEM ) , Toxoplasma-infected cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde ( Electron Microscopy Sciences ) in 0 . 25 M HEPES ( pH 7 . 4 ) for 1 h at room temperature , then in 8% paraformaldehyde in the same buffer overnight at 4\u00b0C . They were infiltrated , frozen and sectioned as previously described [21] . The sections were immunolabeled with anti-SAG1 antibodies ( 1:50 ) in PBS/1% fish skin gelatin , then with anti-IgG antibodies , followed directly by 10 nm protein A-gold particles to detect SAG1 . Data were displayed in box plots using Kaleidagraph software ( Synergy Software ) or graphed in Excel ( Microsoft ) with standard deviations displayed . Whiskers of the box plots represent the upper and lower values excluding outliers , outliers are marked as open circles , and the line inside the box is the median value . Means and standard deviations were calculated from three independent experiments using Excel ( Microsoft ) . p values were calculated using either student t-test or a Chi-squared test in Excel ( Microsoft ) .", "headings": ["Abstract", "Introduction", "Results", "Discussion", "Materials and methods"], "keywords": ["biochemistry", "lipids", "medicine and health sciences", "protozoans", "pathology and laboratory medicine", "toxoplasma", "host-pathogen interactions", "parasite replication", "toxoplasma gondii", "parasitology", "biology and life sciences", "fatty acids", "neutral lipids", "pathogenesis", "parasitic diseases", "parasitic protozoans", "organisms"], "id": "journal.ppat.1006362"}
{"lay_summary": "Despite the widespread prevalence of liver fluke infections and many efforts aimed at developing a preventive vaccine just one drug , triclabendazole , is effective in killing all parasite stages . This is aggravated by the increasing number of countries reporting parasite isolates resistant to triclabendazole treatment , highlighting the urgent need to develop new agents to control fluke infections . Here , we report the discovery of chalcones that effectively inhibits key cysteine proteases essential for parasite development and survival within the host . We further characterized the mode of inhibition of the most active compound against cathepsins secreted by both adult and larval stages of the parasite . This class of compounds is generally considered safe for clinical use and we showed that the most effective derivative is not cytotoxic to bovine sperm cells . Importantly , in vitro approaches showed that it reduces host penetration and larvae viability , finally leading to parasite death . These findings point at this derivative as a good starting point for the development of novel agents to control fluke infection and possibly other helminthic diseases .", "article": "Increased reports of human infections have led fasciolosis , a widespread disease of cattle and sheep caused by the liver flukes Fasciola hepatica and Fasciola gigantica , to be considered an emerging zoonotic disease . Chemotherapy is the main control measure available , and triclabendazole is the preferred drug since is effective against both juvenile and mature parasites . However , resistance to triclabendazole has been reported in several countries urging the search of new chemical entities and target molecules to control fluke infections . We searched a library of forty flavonoid derivatives for inhibitors of key stage specific Fasciola hepatica cysteine proteases ( FhCL3 and FhCL1 ) . Chalcones substituted with phenyl and naphtyl groups emerged as good cathepsin L inhibitors , interacting more frequently with two putative binding sites within the active site cleft of the enzymes . One of the compounds , C34 , tightly bounds to juvenile specific FhCL3 with an IC50 of 5 . 6 \u03bcM . We demonstrated that C34 is a slow-reversible inhibitor that interacts with the Cys-His catalytic dyad and key S2 and S3 pocket residues , determinants of the substrate specificity of this family of cysteine proteases . Interestingly , C34 induces a reduction in NEJ ability to migrate through the gut wall and a loss of motility phenotype that leads to NEJ death within a week in vitro , while it is not cytotoxic to bovine cells . Up to date there are no reports of in vitro screening for non-peptidic inhibitors of Fasciola hepatica cathepsins , while in general these are considered as the best strategy for in vivo inhibition . We have identified chalcones as novel inhibitors of the two main Cathepsins secreted by juvenile and adult liver flukes . Interestingly , one compound ( C34 ) is highly active towards the juvenile enzyme reducing larval ability to penetrate the gut wall and decreasing NEJ\u00b4s viability in vitro . These findings open new avenues for the development of novel agents to control fluke infection and possibly other helminthic diseases . \n Parasitic flatworms are the causative agents of serious human and livestock infections many of which have been considered neglected tropical diseases in urgent need for research efforts . Liver flukes ( Fasciola spp . ) cause fasciolosis , traditionally a relevant disease of cattle , sheep and goats [1] , currently considered an emerging zoonotic disease by the World Health Organization due to an increased incidence of human infections [2] . Despite many efforts to develop a vaccine to prevent mammalian infection [3] , chemotherapy is the only Fasciola control mechanism currently available . Triclabendazole is the first choice drug since it is effective in killing juvenile and mature parasites , but resistance is emerging in several countries [4 , 5] . This highlights the urgency of finding novel strategies and target molecules for developing innovative drugs to treat fluke infections . Many virulence factors have been identified as primary targets for parasite control , since they can be used for developing therapies based on drugs or immunogens . Cysteine proteases play essential roles in numerous protozoan ( like Trypanosoma cruzi and Plasmodium falciparum ) and other helminth parasites [6] , were they have been explored as appropriate targets for antiparasitic chemotherapy [7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11] . Liver flukes secrete high amounts of cysteine proteases being key players in host-parasite interaction at all stages of their life cycle [12 , 13 , 14 , 15] . Cathepsin L3 is expressed by the newly excysted juveniles ( NEJ ) and consequently take part in the first steps of mammalian host infection [12 , 13 , 15 , 16] . A different set of cathepsins L are produced by adult flukes residing in the bile ducts [15 , 16] and are involved mainly in digesting nutrients and developing immune responses mechanisms [17 , 18] . Therefore , F . hepatica cathepsins are interesting targets for drug development in an effort to avoid parasite infection or reduce parasite burden and the pathogenic effects of the infection . Due to their role in human disease and tumour progression , inhibitors targeting cysteine proteases have been extensively studied . Most efforts were focused on peptidic inhibitors with different substituents such as aminoacetonitriles , heterocyclic ketones , nitriles , epoxides and vinyl sulfones [19 , 20 , 21] . Many of these small molecules contain electrophilic groups that bind in the active-site through covalent interactions with the catalytic cysteine either in a reversible or irreversible way . Non-peptidic compounds have also been reported as cathepsin inhibitors , which are considered a better strategy for in vivo inhibition in order to avoid degradation by proteases . Among these , chalcones and other flavonoids can be found [22 , 23 , 24] . Flavonoids are biologically active compounds that possess remarkable properties , being presented as antioxidant , anticancer , antidiabetes , anti-inflammatory , antiprotozoal , antiHIV , antituberculosis , among many other interesting activities [25 , 26 , 27] . What is more , several flavonoids , particularly chalcones , have shown good pharmacological potential and have been approved for clinical use or tested in humans [27] . There have also been described flavonoid derivatives with cathepsin L-like cysteine protease inhibitory activity [23 , 28 , 29 , 30 , 31] as well as some natural flavonoids with fasciolicide activity [32 , 33] . However , up to date there are no reports of in vitro screening for non-peptidic inhibitors of Fasciola cathepsins ( FhCLs ) or in vitro screening of synthetic chalcones with fasciolicide activity . Taking this into account , we performed a search for small molecular weight compounds from our own library of synthetic flavonoids that may inhibit key Fasciola cysteine proteases as FhCL3 and FhCL1 . FhCL3 is the only cathepsin L found in the early NEJ excretion/secretion products [12 , 13 , 14 , 16] , and FhCL1 is the main cathepsin expressed by adult flukes [14 , 15] . This kind of compounds was also previously assayed as anti-tumoral and cancer chemopreventive agents showing non-mutagenic effects and being well tolerated in vivo [34 , 35 , 36] . Here , we identified novel inhibitors of F . hepatica cathepsins with in vitro fasciolicide activity which shall contribute in the design of novel drugs to control fluke infection . \n Since flavonoids have been reported as able to inhibit cysteine protease family enzymes , we evaluated 39 synthetic flavonoids ( S1\u2013S3 Tables ) from our chemical library . In order to test a variety of chemical entities , we included chalcones without ( C1-C8 , C20 and C21 ) or with ( C9-C19 and C22-C26 ) a 2'-substituent in the A ring , chalcones with extended aromaticity ( C27-C35 ) and flavones ( C36-C39 ) along with the natural flavonol quercetin ( C40 ) . FhCL1 and FhCL3 recombinant enzymes were expressed in the yeast Hansenula polymorpha as previously described [17 , 39] . Briefly , yeast transformants were cultured in 500 mL YEPD broth ( 1% glucose , 1% tryptone , 1% yeast extract ) at 37\u00b0C to an OD600 of 2\u20136 , harvested by centrifugation at 3000xg for 10 min and induced by resuspending in 50 mL of buffered minimal media ( 0 . 67% yeast nitrogen base; 0 . 1M phosphate buffer pH 6 . 0; 1% methanol ) for 36 h at 30\u00b0C . Recombinant propeptidases were secreted to the culture media , and recovered by 20\u201330 fold concentration of culture supernatants by ultrafiltration with a 10 kDa cut-off membrane . The proenzymes were autocatalytically activated to the mature form by incubation for 2 h at 37\u00b0C in 0 . 1 M sodium citrate buffer ( pH 5 . 0 ) with 2 mM DTT and 2 . 5 mM EDTA , dialyzed against PBS pH 7 . 3 and stored in aliquots at -20\u00b0C until used . Functionally active recombinant enzyme was determined by titration against the cysteine protease inhibitor E-64c . A 10 mM stock of each evaluated compound was prepared in dimethylsulfoxide ( DMSO ) . Enzyme activity assays were conducted to evaluate the inhibitory capacity of the different compounds . FhCL1 and FhCL3 were used at nanomolar concentrations to measure initial rates during the first 10 min of the assay and compounds were tested at a moderate fixed dose of 10 \u03bcM . Briefly , each enzyme and compound were preincubated 5 minutes in a 96-well plate in 0 . 1M sodium phosphate buffer pH 6 , 1 mM DTT and 1 mM EDTA at room temperature . The reaction was initiated by the addition of 20 \u03bcM of substrate , a synthetic peptide conjugated to the fluorophore 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin ( AMC ) . Enzyme activity was measured by the increase in AMC fluorescence as peptide substrates were hydrolyzed ( Z-VLK-AMC for FhCL1 and Tos-GPR-AMC for FhCL3 ) at an excitation wavelength of 340 nm and emission wavelength of 440 nm using a spectrofluorometer ( Varioskan Thermo ) . Enzyme activity was expressed as RFU/s ( relative fluorescence units of AMC released per unit of time ) . Each compound was tested in duplicate . A progress curve without enzyme was performed to control for non-catalyzed reactions between substrates and inhibitors and a spectrum from 300 to 450 nm wavelength was done for each inhibitor to verify that none of the compounds has optical activity in the measurement range . The percentage of enzyme inhibition was calculated as: 100 - ( vi/vo ) x 100 , where vi and vo correspond to the initial rate of AMC fluorescence increase ( RFU/s ) with and without inhibitor , respectively . IC50 was calculated at 12 different concentrations of the inhibitor compound , 0 , 0 . 625 , 0 . 937 , 1 . 25 , 1 . 875 , 2 . 5 , 3 . 75 , 5 , 7 . 5 , 10 , 15 and 20 \u03bcM . The measurement of enzyme activity was performed in triplicate in a 96-well plate as previously described . We plotted initial rates ( RFU/s ) versus log10 of inhibitor concentration and obtained the IC50 value from a linear regression of the data . We also carried out slow-binding assays to evaluate if inhibition was time-dependent . C34 at 10 \u03bcM was incubated with each enzyme for increasing lengths of time from 3 to 120 min and the percentage of inhibition was determined as described for the screening assay . To test for reversibility of the enzyme-compound interaction , we performed rapid dilution assays [37] . Briefly , samples containing each enzyme at a 100-fold concentration ( compared with standard assays ) were preincubated with 10-fold the IC50-equivalent concentration of the inhibitor for 20 min at room temperature . Control reactions for each enzyme without inhibitor were carried out in parallel . Samples were then diluted 100-fold with assay buffer containing the appropriate substrate to initiate reactions , and the time course of AMC release was measured as previously describe . FhCL1 and FhCL3 structures previously obtained by homology modelling were used [38 , 39] ( Robinson 2011 , Corvo 2013 ) . In order to improve structures accuracy for molecular docking , MD simulations were performed using the pmemd module implemented in the AMBER12 package [40] , with the ff03 . r1 force field [41] . Hydrogen atoms and sodium ions ( to neutralize charge ) were added to each protein with the leap utility . Each system was placed in a truncated octahedral box of TIP3P explicit water [42] , extended 10 \u00c5 outside the protein on all sides . The structures of FhCL1 and FhCL3 were treated as follows: a ) water and counterions were relaxed to minimize energy during 2 , 500 steps ( 500 steepest descent steps , SD , and 2 , 000 conjugate-gradient steps , CG ) with the protein restrained with a force constant of 500 kcal/mol\u00c52; b ) the system was minimized without restraints during 20 , 000 steps ( 5 , 000 SD and 15 , 000 CG ) . Long range electrostatic interactions were considered using the particle-mesh Ewald ( PME ) method [43] and a non-bonded interactions cutoff of 10 \u00c5 was used . After minimization , each system was gradually heated in a NVT ensemble from 0 to 300 K over 100 ps using the Berendsen coupling algorithm [44] . This procedure was followed by 20 ns of NPT simulations at 300 K and 1 atm pressure using the Langevin dynamics algorithm [45] . All bonds involving hydrogen atoms were constrained using the SHAKE algorithm [46] . The equations of motion were integrated with a time step of 2 . 0 fs and coordinates of the systems were saved every 2 ps . Representative structures of FhCL1 and FhCL3 from the last 30 ns of the trajectories were obtained through cluster analysis using the average-linkage algorithm [47] and used for subsequent docking calculations . Clustering , RMSD , RMSF and hydrogen bond analysis were performed using the cpptraj module in AmberTools14 . For trajectories visualization the VMD program was used [48] . Compounds 1\u201339 ( S1\u2013S3 Tables ) were fully optimized at the \u03c9B97XD/6-31+G ( d , p ) level [49 , 50] in water using the IEF-PCM continuum model [51] with Bondi atomic radii . The nature of the optimized structures as stable species was inspected checking the eigenvalues of the analytic Hessian matrix , calculated at the same level of theory , to be positive in all the cases . All these calculations were performed using the Gaussian09 software [52] . To predict the binding site of flavonoids C1-C39 into FhCL1 and FhCL3 flexible-ligand docking was performed using a grid box of 126\u00d794\u00d7116 points with a grid spacing of 0 . 60 \u00c5 in order to cover the entire protein surface ( blind docking ) . The grid box was centered on the macromolecule . Results differing by less than 2 . 0 \u00c5 in root-square deviation were grouped in the same cluster . The conformation with the lowest binding energy was chosen from the most populated cluster and the corresponding ligand-protein complex was used for further MD studies . All docking calculations were done with the AutoDock 4 . 2 [53] software package using the Lamarckian genetic algorithm . A population size of 150 individuals and 2 . 5\u00d7106 energy evaluations were used for 50 search runs . MD simulations of C34 with FhCL1 and FhCL3 were performed as described above using the GAFF [54] force field for the ligand . RESP partial charges [55] for C34 were derived using Gaussian09 at the HF/6-31G* level and the antechamber module in AMBER12 was employed to obtain the force field parameters . 40 ns of productive MD were simulated and coordinates of the systems were saved every 10 ps . F . hepatica metacercariae were acquired from Baldwin Aquatics Inc . ( Monmouth , Oregon ) for in vitro NEJ treatment and from Instituto Miguel C . Rubino ( DILAVE , MGAP , Uruguay ) for the gut invasion assay . NEJ were obtained by in vitro excystement as previously described with minor modifications [56] , with no differences observed between metacercariae from different origin . Briefly , 100 metacercariae were incubated with 1% sodium hypochlorite for 5 min at room temperature to remove the outer cyst wall and then washed exhaustively with PBS . Metacercarie were activated by incubation at 39\u00b0C in a medium prepared by mixing equal volumes of solution A ( 0 . 4% sodium taurocholate , 120 mM NaHCO3 , 140 mM NaCl pH 8 . 0 ) and solution B ( 50 mM HCl and 33 mM L-cysteine ) . A 100 \u03bcm filters were used to retain the cyst wall as NEJ began to emerge . The excystment process was monitored for m90-180 min under the microscope . Collected NEJ were washed three times with RPMI-1640 supplemented with 200 U/mL Penicillin G sulfate , 200 mg/mL streptomycin sulfate , 500 ng/mL amphotericin B , 10 mM HEPES , counted and divided in groups of around 20 parasites that were transferred to 12 wells tissue culture plates . Parasites were maintained at 37\u00b0C , 5% CO2 in modified Basch\u2019s medium [57] . At day 1 , C34 ( 50 \u03bcM ) was added to treated groups and 0 . 5% DMSO to control groups , each condition tested by duplicate . Medium was changed twice a week and fresh compound was added , control NEJ were cultured for 20 days . NEJ behavior was monitored under a light microscope ( Olympus BX41 ) , every day each well was recorded for a minute in order to assess parasite motility and registered using the following score: 3-normally active; 2- reduced activity ( sporadic movement ) ; 1- immotile ( adapted from [58] ) . For the gut invasion assay we performed an in vitro excystement of metacercarie as previously described and incubated the NEJ for 4 h either in the presence of 50 \u03bcM C34 or 0 . 5% DMSO ( control group ) and immediately transferred them to gut sacs . For gut preparation we used the protocol previously described by Burden et al . with some modifications [59] . Brifely , 6 weeks old male Wistar rats were euthanized by cervical dislocation and approximately 25 cm of small intestine was excised using the caecum as a reference . The intestine was washed several times with RPMI-1640 media warmed at 37\u00b0C and cut in 5 cm sacs . One end of each sac was ligated , 20\u201330 NEJ from treated or control groups were pipetted inside the sac and then the other end was ligated . Gut sacs were maintained in RPMI-1640 media at 37\u00b0C , 5% CO2 in 12 wells plates and parasites that migrated through the mucosal wall within 3 h were recovered at the plate bottom and counted . Each condition was assayed in triplicate . Semen samples were obtained from a healthy fertile Hereford bull and kept frozen in 0 . 5 mL straws ( extended in Andromed , Minitube , Germany ) under liquid nitrogen until use . The semen used belonged to a single freezing batch that was obtained during a regular collection schedule with an artificial vagina . Samples from three straws were thawed and a sperm pool was prepared in PBS at a concentration of 40 million spermatozoa per mL , then 50 \u03bcL of this sperm suspension was carefully mixed with 50 \u03bcL of C34 diluted to 100 , 50 , 25 , 12 . 5 and 6 . 25 \u03bcM or with 1% DMSO in control experiments . Each condition was assayed by duplicate in 96-well plates and controls were assayed by triplicate . Plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 h with moderate shaking . The motility analysis was carried out using a CASA ( Computer Assisted Semen Analyzer ) system Androvision ( Minitube , Tiefenbach , Germany ) with an Olympus BX 41 microscope ( Olympus , Japan ) equipped with a warm-stage at 37\u00b0C . Each sample ( 10 \u03bcL ) was placed onto a Makler Counting Chamber ( deph 10 \u03bcm , Sefi-Medical Instruments , Israel ) and the following parameters were evaluated: percentage of total motile spermatozoa ( motility >5 \u03bcm/s ) and velocity curved line ( VCL , >24 \u03bcm/s ) . At least 400 spermatozoa were analysed from each sample from at least four microscope fields . \n We evaluated forty flavonoids from three structural clusters of our own chemistry library as inhibitors of FhCL1 and FhCL3 . Cluster I contained twenty-six chalcones modified in ring B ( C1-C26 , Fig 1A ) , cluster II contained naphtolchalcone derivatives ( C27-C35 , Fig 1B ) and cluster III was composed of flavones modified in ring B ( C36-C40 , Fig 1B ) . Initially , we screened the compounds at a low concentration of 10 \u03bcM measuring initial rates during the first 10 min , finding activities ranging from 0% to 75% enzyme inhibition ( Fig 1 ) . Roughly , a larger amount of compounds decreased FhCL1 activity considerably , while FhCL3 proved more difficult to inhibit . Thus , eleven compounds showed more than 50% inhibition of FhCL1 ( C3 , C10 , C22-C24 , C27 , C30 , C31 , C33 , C34 and C35 ) ( Fig 1 ) , while two of them , belonging to cluster II , were above this cut-off for FhCL3 , C34 and C35 ( Fig 1B ) , being C34 the best global inhibitor . None of the assayed flavones ( cluster III ) displayed relevant activities against both FhCL1 and FhCL3 ( % inhibition at 10 \u03bcM lower than 20% , Fig 1B ) for this reason the studied population of flavones was lower than the chalcones one . In general , chalcones containing heterocycles as B-ring in cluster I ( C22-C26 ) and those with extended aromaticity belonging to cluster II showed the highest inhibition percentages . Clearly , this kind of compounds inhibited more readily FhCL1 than FhCL3 ( fourteen showing at least 50% inhibition of FhCL1 vs two with FhCL3 at 10 \u03bcM ) . These might be explained considering the active site pocket structure and substrate preferences of the enzymes . While FhCL1 has a wide S2 pocket which easily accommodates bulky and aromatic residues , FhCL3 has a narrow and restricted site that preferentially interacts with small moieties like proline and glycine [39] . Strikingly , C34 substituted by a hydroxyl at position 2 of the A-ring and with a naphthyl on both rings , was the best inhibitor of FhCL3 , showing 75% inhibition for FhCL1 and 65% for FhCL3 in the screening . Likewise , the highest percentages of FhCL3 inhibition correspond to the same type of compounds ( C28 , C30 , C31 , C35 ) ( Fig 1B ) . We hypothesized that the narrower conformation of FhCL3 active site compared to FhCL1 diminishes the number of compounds that manage to accommodate in such a position as to allow enzyme inhibition . There are some interesting compounds showing selectivity towards FhCL1 , for example derivatives C4 , C13 and C22-C25 exhibiting around 50% inhibition of the former enzyme and poor or no inhibition of FhCL3 . These compounds belong to the group containing heterocycles as B-ring ( C22-C25 ) or 4-methoxy moiety on the B-phenyl ring ( C4 , C13 ) , that might establish hydrogen bonds with specific residues of this enzyme ( S4 Table ) . Particularly , C20 , the non-hydroxylated analogue of C22 , does not inhibit FhCL1 , suggesting the 2\u00b4-OH might also be playing an important role in this inhibition . A chalcone with extended aromaticity ( C27 ) also exhibits 65% inhibition of FhCL1 and only 13% of FhCL3 , being the only one with a phenyl substituent as B-ring . Notably , among these bulky compounds , the less active towards FhCL1 was C29 , which lacks Michael-acceptor motive susceptible of nucleophilic attack by enzyme residues ( Fig 1B , S2 Table ) . The p-Cl substituted chalcone C10 also showed good inhibition for FhCL1 ( 63% ) ( Fig 1A , S1 Table ) . Likewise , this compound offers some interesting structure-activity relationships . Here , a positive influence of the 2\u00b4-OH in the inhibition might be addressed again when comparing C10 with its de-2\u00b4OH analogue C2 that exhibits only 25% of inhibition . Besides , its bioisostere p-Br substituted on the B-ring ( C11 ) depicts poor inhibition of FhCL1 ( 19% ) , suggesting that it is the combination of both 2\u00b4-OH and p-Cl substituents that exerts optimum inhibition of this enzyme ( Fig 1A , S1 Table ) . We selected C34 to perform additional characterization as it was the best inhibitor of both target enzymes . Consequently , a dose-response study was performed . The IC50 was similar with both enzymes , being 7 . 7 \u03bcM and 5 . 6 \u03bcM for FhCL1 and FhCL3 respectively ( Table 1 ) . Interestingly , the interaction mode with each enzyme seems to differ . Longer incubation times at 10 \u03bcM resulted in higher inhibition of FhCL3 but not FhCL1 , thus C34 interacts in a slow-binding time-dependent fashion only with the former enzyme . Furthermore , when increasing the preincubation time with the enzyme , FhCL3 is almost completely inhibited ( 96% ) ( Table 1 ) . We then evaluated the reversibility of the inhibition by measuring the recovery of enzymatic activity after a rapid and large dilution of the enzyme\u2013inhibitor complex . When the initial rate of the reaction is similar in the presence and absence of the inhibitor , it indicates a rapid recovery of activity after compound dilution meaning the reaction is reversible . This was the case for the interaction of C34 with FhCL1 ( Fig 2 , left panel ) , where the progress curve after inhibitor dilution has a slope similar to that of the control sample ( enzyme incubated and diluted in the absence of inhibitor ) ; however , we found a different behavior with FhCL3 . Here , the progress curves have a lag phase followed by a linear phase ( Fig 2 , right panel ) , reflecting the slow recovery of activity as inhibitor dissociates from the enzyme and suggesting that the interaction of C34 with FhCL3 is slowly reversible being the compound tightly bound to the enzyme . According to docking results the studied compounds most frequently interact with a putative binding site , represented in cyan for FhCL1 and orange for FhCL3 , and found at a similar position within the active site cleft of each enzyme ( Fig 3 ) . A second putative binding site ( represented in blue ) was observed for FhCL3 , which has a different orientation and is not as deep located inside the binding site ( Fig 3 ) . To obtain a deeper knowledge of C34 interaction with target enzymes , 40 ns molecular dynamics simulations were performed allowing us to confirm the binding sites predicted by docking , as we obtained stable complexes in the last 35 ns of the simulation ( S1 Fig ) . Thus , the high percentage of inhibition experimentally observed can be attributed to the compound locating next to residues directly implicated in substrate positioning and catalysis ( Figs 4 and 5 ) . From a population cluster analysis , we determined the most representative structure for the enzyme-inhibitor complex for FhCL1 , with an occurrence of 51% ( Fig 4 upper panel ) . We found two more clusters with occurrences of 24% and 22% that , while changing the relative position and interaction with certain residues , still occupy the active site ( Fig 4 middle and lower panels , respectively ) , and two last clusters with lower occurrences of 2 and 1% ( not shown ) . For FhCL3 , C34 occupies the orange site ( Fig 3 ) along the entire simulation time . A major cluster with an occurrence of 59% is observed ( Fig 5 upper panel ) , followed by another two clusters with lower occurrences of 23% and 11% ( Fig 5 middle and lower panels , respectively ) , and two with less occurrences of 6 and 1% ( not shown ) , similar in location and relative position to the major cluster . The experimentally observed variation in inhibition percentages might be explained by the high number of interactions established by the ligand with each target . It is worth noticing that the experimental results were in good correlation with computational observations . C34 is positioned along the active site cleft in both enzymes and interacts with Cys-His catalytic dyad and residues from the S2 and S3 pockets ( Figs 4 and 5 ) , determinants of the substrate specificity of this family of cysteine proteases [39 , 61] . FhCL1 establishes several hydrophobic interactions with the inhibitor , particularly through residues Gly66 , Gly67 , Val160 and Asn161 from S2 and S3 subsites , and Cys25 from the catalytic dyad ( Fig 4 ) . Likewise , we observed many hydrophobic interactions of C34 with FhCL3 , with a larger number of residues belonging to the enzyme sub-sites: Trp69 , Met70 , Ala135 , Val160 , Thr161 , Val163 and Ala209 , which form the entire S2 subsite , plus Gly68 belonging to S3 subsite , both decisive in FhCL3 substrate positioning for catalysis ( Fig 5 ) . In this sense , the high inhibition experimentally observed for C34 with both enzymes is confirmed . Interestingly , Trp69 can contribute to inhibitor binding by establishing Pi-Pi stacking interactions . This residue is specific of FhCL3 and when mutated for Leu as in FhCL1 it renders the enzyme almost inactive highlighting its importance for substrate positioning for catalysis [39] . A recent in silico search for FhCL3 inhibitors provides additional evidence that the non-polar side chain of Trp69 establishes critical interaction with ligands and adopts variable conformations to accommodate different groups in the enzyme binding site [62] . Furthermore , it showed that aromatic moieties with high hydrophobicity can establish favorable interactions with non-polar residues from FhCL3 binding cleft [62] . The greater number of interactions between inhibitor and residues from FhCL3 sub-sites compared with FhCL1 , might explain its lower IC50 ( Table 1 ) , its behavior as a slowly reversible inhibitor ( Fig 2 ) , and its highest percentage of inhibition reached after 120 min ( Table 1 ) . No hydrogen bonds with a significant occupancy ( greater than 50 ) along the simulation time were found in any of the enzyme-inhibitor complexes , except for the bond between carbonyl oxygen in C34 and Gly68 with an occupancy of 22 in FhCL1 ( Fig 4 ) , analogous to the interaction with Glu72 in FhCL3 , with only 11 of occupancy ( Fig 5 ) . However , there are significant differences in the hydrogen bonds at the protein structural level , where some intra-molecular protein hydrogen bonds have an occupancy greater than 90 in the absence of inhibitor but disappear in its presence , mainly in the FhCL3-inhibitor complex ( Fig 6 ) . If we analyze the hydrogen bonds involving residues from sub-sites S2 and S3 in FhCL1 ( Fig 6 and S5 Table , residues in bold ) , we see a tendency to diminish its occupancy in the presence of C34 , supporting its interaction along the active site alters local protein conformation . A similar behavior is observed in FhCL3 , with a more remarkable loss in occupancy seen for hydrogen bonds involving Val136-Thr161 , Asp137- Thr161 and His63-Arg58 ( Fig 6 and S6 Table , residues in bold ) . Moreover , upon ligand binding new hydrogen bonds are established between backbone and side chains of sub-site residues ( with occupancy greater than 50 ) in the proximity of C34 binding site ( Fig 6 , HB with \u0394Occ . \u02c20 ) , named His63-Gly66 , Trp69-Asn62 and Ala135-Ala163 ( S6 Table , residues in bold ) , again suggesting the interaction with C34 dramatically alters protein conformation and thus its ability for catalysis . We evaluated the effect of C34 on NEJ parasites cultured in vitro . NEJ were incubated in the presence of 50 \u03bcM C34 and the assessment of parasite movement is shown in Fig 7 . The addition of C34 resulted in a decrease in parasite motility leading to parasite death . At day 4 the percentage of immobile flukes was considerably higher in treated vs control groups , 67% vs 0% respectively . The percentage of sporadic movement and immobile parasites increased in treated parasites and evident signs of internal and tegument damage appeared . Culture media was dirty as compared to control flukes due to the release of body components and some NEJ died protruding their anterior region ( Fig 7 , S1 and S2 Videos ) . After day 10 no movement was detected in treated NEJ while control parasites continue moving until the experiment was finished on day 20 , thus , motility seems to adequately estimate worm viability . There have been controversial findings regarding the effect of cathepsin L knock down by RNAi . While a recent work described no phenotypic changes in NEJ even after 21 days of exposure to long dsRNA or siRNA [63] , an earlier report had documented immobile NEJ after a 4h interference with Cat-L and B siRNA [64] . Here , we observed a reduction in fluke motility consistent with this first report . Additional evidence supporting this result comes from an in vitro treatment of NEJ with the cathepsin L and B inhibitors E64-d and CA-074Me , which resulted in the loss of worm motility accompanied by structural damage of parasites [65] . In a similar fashion , they observed a progressive loss of motility starting 5 to 12 days after treatment initiation . As a consequence of decreased motility , a diminished ability of parasites to traverse the duodenum wall was reported [64] . In order to check if C34 treatment can also impair invasion , we performed a gut penetration assay . NEJ incubated 4h with C34 showed the expected phenotype of reduced migration through the gut wall , suggesting the impairment of cathepsin L function ( Fig 8 ) . While the in vitro treatment effect of movement reduction is seen after longer incubation times with C34 , a reduced gut penetration is readily detected in the invasion assay . This is indicative that the main role of juvenile cathepsin L3 in parasite host invasion is promptly affected , and a secondary effect on parasite movement might emerge later . In the host environment , this might translate into a considerable reduction in the number of NEJ able to reach the bile ducts and establish a successful infection . Citotoxicity assays using spermatozoa are considered a suitable approach for preclinical toxicology screening during drug development processes [66] . The cytotoxicity assay on bovine spermatozoa showed C34 is not toxic to reproductive cells even at the highest tested dose of 100 \u03bcM . We observed no significant differences on percentage of motile spermatozoa and velocity curved line between treated and control samples ( S7 Table ) . Also , our previous studies showed C34 is not mutagenic in Ames test using Salmonella typhimurium TA98 strain with and without metabolic activation and no genotoxic effect was observed measuring DNA damage in the alkaline comet assay [36] , supporting the fact that this class of compounds exhibits low toxicity and are promising agents for clinical usage . In this work we have identified novel chalcones that inhibit Fasciola hepatica major cathepsins L from both adult and juvenile parasites . Chalcones with heterocycles as B-ring ( C22-C26 ) and chalcones containing phenyl and naphtyl moieties ( C27-C35 ) showed the highest inhibition percentages . Among these , C34 resulted a slow-reversible tight binding inhibitor of FhCL3 , exerting an almost complete inactivation of the enzyme . In addition , we performed an extensively computational analysis characterizing C34 interaction with cathepsins providing evidence of the different inhibition seen with each target enzyme . We demonstrated C34 is not toxic to bovine sperm , exhibits in vitro fasciolicide activity over cultured NEJ and reduces larval penetration of the gut wall , suggesting is a suitable candidate for further drug development against worm infection .", "headings": ["Abstract", "Introduction", "Methods", "Results and Discussion"], "keywords": ["invertebrates", "chemical bonding", "medicine and health sciences", "enzymes", "enzymology", "parasitic diseases", "animals", "germ cells", "trematodes", "cysteine proteases", "enzyme inhibitors", "hydrogen bonding", "sperm", "physical chemistry", "animal cells", "proteins", "flatworms", "fasciola", "chemistry", "biochemistry", "enzyme structure", "cell biology", "biology and life sciences", "cellular types", "physical sciences", "proteases", "organisms"], "id": "journal.pntd.0004834"}
{"lay_summary": "The process of neurotransmission involves the conversion of electrical signals into the release of a chemical neurotransmitter from the neurons synaptic terminal , and the key trigger for this release is a rise in calcium concentration . Accordingly , the amplitude and speed of this calcium signal controls the amplitude and time-course of synaptic communication . Working on the synaptic terminals of fish retinal bipolar cells , we show that the presynaptic calcium signal and the subsequent neurotransmitter release are shaped by the basic property of synapse volume . Using a combination of experimental approaches and computational models , we found that large synapses are slow and adapt little during ongoing stimulation , while small synapses are fast and show more profound adaptation . This observation leads to a second key concept: since neurons usually have several presynaptic terminals that may vary in volume , a single neuron can , in principle , forward different synaptic signals to different postsynaptic partners . We provide direct evidence that this is the case for bipolar cells of the fish retina .", "article": "The visual system transmits information about fast and slow changes in light intensity through separate neural pathways . We used in vivo imaging to investigate how bipolar cells transmit these signals to the inner retina . We found that the volume of the synaptic terminal is an intrinsic property that contributes to different temporal filters . Individual cells transmit through multiple terminals varying in size , but smaller terminals generate faster and larger calcium transients to trigger vesicle release with higher initial gain , followed by more profound adaptation . Smaller terminals transmitted higher stimulus frequencies more effectively . Modeling global calcium dynamics triggering vesicle release indicated that variations in the volume of presynaptic compartments contribute directly to all these differences in response dynamics . These results indicate how one neuron can transmit different temporal components in the visual signal through synaptic terminals of varying geometries with different adaptational properties . \n The retina analyzes the visual world through a series of spatio-temporal filters that establish parallel representations for transmission to the brain [1]\u2013[4] . The anatomical organization of these channels is established in the inner plexiform layer ( IPL ) , which is organized into five to six distinct strata containing the dendrites of as many as 20 different types of retinal ganglion cell ( RGC ) [2] . In each stratum , bipolar cells ( BCs ) with distinct filtering properties make excitatory synaptic connections with defined subsets of RGCs [5] . For instance , \u201ctransient\u201d RGCs are thought to receive excitatory inputs from BCs with bandpass characteristics , while \u201csustained\u201d RGCs receive inputs from BCs acting as low-pass filters [6] . A long-standing question is how multiple spatio-temporal filters are built using the limited numbers of neurons responding to a particular region of the visual field [7]\u2013[9] . An answer might lie in reconsidering the fundamental neural element through which the visual signal is transmitted to the inner retina: although individual BCs have diverse properties , their output is transmitted through a much more numerous and heterogeneous component of neural circuits\u2013synapses [10] . Indeed , recent evidence indicates that different synapses of the same BC transmit the visual signal with varying kinetics because of local interactions with different types of inhibitory amacrine cells [11] . Here we ask whether heterogeneous transmission of the visual signal might also reflect intrinsic variations between the various synaptic compartments of a BC . The property we concentrate on is the volume of the terminal , which is expected to influence the amplitude and kinetics of the presynaptic calcium signal controlling neurotransmission [12] . To observe the activity of multiple BC synapses we used zebrafish expressing fluorescent proteins reporting the fusion of synaptic vesicles or the presynaptic calcium signal driving fusion [13] , [14] . Here we demonstrate that BC terminals of different sizes tend to transform the visual signal in different ways . On average , smaller terminals generate calcium transients that are larger and faster , resulting in a higher initial gain of responses to an increase in temporal contrast followed by more profound adaptation . Small terminals also transmit high frequencies more effectively . Such differences in the outputs of small and large terminals are also observed in individual cells , which therefore have an intrinsic ability to filter visual information through channels with different gains , temporal filters and adaptive properties . \n In the vertebrate retina , signals from rod and cone photoreceptors travel through BCs to be transmitted through synaptic terminals of various sizes ( Figure 1A ) . To survey the activity of many BC synapses in a live animal , we imaged eight to ten days post fertilisation ( dpf ) zebrafish larvae expressing sypHy , a reporter of vesicle fusion ( Figure 1B ) [14] , [15] , or SyGCaMP2 , which signals the presynaptic calcium transient [13] , [16] . Regions of interest defining individual terminals in images of the IPL were generated using an algorithm based on a Laplace operator ( Figure 1B ) [17] , from which we estimated the \u201ceffective terminal radius\u201d ( Materials and Methods ) . A survey of 5 , 061 terminals revealed a wide variation in radius with a mean of 1 . 13\u00b10 . 40 \u00b5m ( Figure 1C , black bars ) . Terminals of different sizes were not distributed randomly through the IPL ( Figures 1D and S1I ) : terminals in layers 2 and 6 were significantly larger than the average across the whole population of BCs , while terminals in layers 1 , 3 , 4 , and 5 were significantly smaller . How do these variations in the volume of the presynaptic compartment affect the calcium signal that is generated when a stimulus alters the membrane potential and the rate of calcium influx ? To investigate this question we imaged SyGCaMP2 and measured the average response over the whole region of interest ( ROI ) defining each terminal . Although this procedure will neglect calcium gradients within the terminal , these gradients will not be maintained when calcium influx is modulated at frequencies relevant to vision ( see below ) . In a sample of 932 ON terminals , the initial rate of rise of the calcium signal elicited by a full field step of light was approximately twice as fast in the smallest terminals compared to the largest , and the calcium concentration reached a higher steady-state level ( Figure 1E1 , 2 ) . Variations in terminal size were also correlated with differences in the kinetics of exocytosis , as measured in fish expressing sypHy . In a sample of 438 ON terminals , the relative rate of vesicle release in response to the same stimulus ( quantified as a percentage of vesicles released per second ) varied by a factor of at least two between the smallest and largest terminals ( Figure 1F1 , 2 ) [14] , [18] . A similar relationship between release amplitude and terminal size was observed in the OFF channel ( Figure S1G ) . A correlation between the size of a terminal and the amplitude of its response was also observed when the temporal contrast of the stimulus was increased while keeping the mean luminance constant . Figure 1G1 shows averaged SyGCaMP2 responses to modulation of light intensity at 1 Hz ( 100% contrast ) . The power of the calcium signal at the fundamental frequency was greater in small terminals ( r\u200a=\u200a0 . 6\u20131 . 3 \u00b5m ) than in large ( r\u200a=\u200a2 . 1\u20134 . 1 \u00b5m ) , varying by a factor of at least three across the population ( Figure 1G2 ) . Does the correlation between the size of the terminal compartment and the release rate reflect the network in which the terminal is embedded ? For instance , one scenario might be that large terminals respond with lower gain because they receive stronger inhibitory feedback from amacrine cells . To test this possibility , we blocked GABAergic inhibition through ionotropic receptors by injecting 100 \u00b5M picrotoxin into the eye ( Figure 2 ) . This manipulation increased the amplitude of the exocytic response across terminals of all sizes , as would be expected when feedback inhibition is reduced [18] , [19] , but larger terminals continued to respond with lower gain . This observation suggests that the correlation between terminal size and release rate reflects intrinsic properties of the terminal rather than the influence of the network it is embedded in . Might the correlation between stimulus-dependent changes in the brightness of terminals and estimates of their size be caused by a bias in the detection algorithm , perhaps causing smaller terminals to be detected only when their fluorescence signal was strong enough ? Two lines of evidence indicated that this was not the case . First , the distribution of terminal sizes was very similar when measured in transgenic fish expressing synaptophysin-enhanced green fluorescent protein ( EGFP ) , a fluorescent marker of synapses that is not affected by neural activity ( Figure 1C , red bars ) . Second , estimates of terminal size did not differ significantly when measurements were compared under conditions of high and low activity , as described in Figure S1 ( See Methods ) . The results in Figure 1 therefore indicate that the volume of the presynaptic compartment is closely linked to the gain with which BCs transmit the visual signal to the inner retina . Are differences in gain maintained in small and large terminals of the same cell ? We investigated this question both in vivo and in vitro . In vivo experiments used zebrafish transiently expressing Ribeye::GCaMP5 in sparse populations of BCs . Square-wave stimuli ( 100% contrast ) were presented at various frequencies , and Figure 3A\u20133C shows results from one BC responding to a 1 Hz stimulus . The calcium signal in the smaller of the two terminals clearly exhibited the larger degree of modulation ( Figure 3B; cf . Figure 1G1 ) , and the power of the response peaked at a higher frequency ( Figure 3C ) . Qualitatively similar results were obtained from four BCs . We next used slices of goldfish retina to make whole-cell recordings directly from the large terminal of \u201cmixed\u201d BCs , which is connected to smaller presynaptic compartments by narrow processes . Introduction of the Ca2+ indicator Oregon green BAPTA ( OGB-5N ) allowed us to compare presynaptic calcium signals in the large and small compartments while achieving direct electrical control of the terminal system ( Figure 3D; cf . Figure 1A ) [20] . A BC generating a graded voltage response is shown in Figure 3E . The OGB-5N signal in the smaller terminal ( red ) rose faster than that in the large ( black ) , reached more than double the concentration , and then decayed more rapidly . Similar results were observed in eight cells generating purely graded responses . Many BCs in the retina of fish generate voltage spikes as well as graded responses [16] , [21] , [22] , and terminal volume also affected the presynaptic calcium transient generated by these electrical responses [16] , [21]\u2013[23] . In the example in Figure 3F , the small terminal ( red ) responded to each spike with a clear Ca2+ transient , but the signal in the large terminal ( black ) was smaller and slower , and the response to a train of spikes was dominated by the gradual accumulation of Ca2+ . Figures 3G\u20133I summarize these properties in 16 pairs of terminals ( eight graded and eight spiking ) , each pair from a different BC . In all cases , global Ca2+ signals were faster and larger in the smaller of two connected terminals . The same observation was made when the patch-pipette was placed on the soma ( Figure S3 ) . The results in Figure 3 demonstrate that variations in terminal volume profoundly affected the activity of different synapses providing the output from a single BC . The time-constant of decay of a calcium transient ( \u03c4decay ) was directly proportional to the radius of the terminal ( r ) , as shown Figure 3J . This observation was made both when r was estimated from images of terminals filled with dye , and when r was calculated from the capacitance of terminals detached from the cell body . This simple linear relation is notable because it is predicted by single compartment models of calcium dynamics in which there are no significant calcium gradients [24] , [25] . The appropriateness of a single compartment model for BC terminals can be understood in terms of the characteristic time , teq , with which a calcium gradient collapses in a volume of radius r after calcium influx ceases:where DCa is the diffusion coefficient of calcium [26] . Assuming DCa\u200a=\u200a220 \u00b5m2/s [27] , teq , is only \u223c0 . 75 ms in a terminal of r\u200a=\u200a1 \u00b5m , indicating that a calcium gradient will collapse on a much shorter time-scale than stimuli relevant to vision . Even in the largest terminals with r\u200a=\u200a5 \u00b5m , teq is \u223c19 ms , which is less than half the period of a stimulus fluctuating at 20 Hz . The lack of any appreciable calcium gradients on these time-scales was confirmed in a 3-D model in which calcium influx occurred through clusters of calcium channels ( Figure S3 ) . Calcium signals on these spatial scales have been demonstrated to trigger neurotransmitter release from ribbon synapses of fish bipolar cells , although calcium nanodomains very close to calcium channels also play a role in ribbon-type synapses in other neurons and other species [28] . These considerations indicate that there is a direct and causal link between the volume of the presynaptic compartment and the amplitude and kinetics of the calcium transient caused by a stimulus . But why is the volume of the presynaptic compartment also correlated with its output measured as vesicle release ( Figure 1F ) ? Such a link is expected , because it is the calcium signal in the terminal that drives the output . To explore how variations in the size of BC terminals might impact on transmission of visual signals we modeled this process in two stages , described in detail in Text S1 . The output from the first stage was the dynamics of calcium in the terminal , and is shown schematically in Figure 4A . The second stage used these calcium dynamics to predict the kinetics of vesicle release , as described in Figure 5B and below . To model the presynaptic calcium signal , the light stimulus was convolved with the impulse response of a BC to predict the voltage trajectory in the soma ( Figure 4A , top ) . BCs in goldfish have bandpass characteristics with peak transmission varying between about 1\u201314 Hz [22] , and we chose a value of 9 . 5 Hz [29] . The voltage response in the soma was then instantaneously mapped to the presynaptic calcium current using the I\u2013V relation and density of L-type calcium channels measured in the terminal of BCs isolated from goldfish [30] . This I\u2013V relation is an exponential function , changing e-fold in \u223c6 . 6 mV over the physiological range of membrane potentials [30] . These first two steps in the model are analogous to the linear-nonlinear ( LN ) model that has been used to provide a description of responses in RGCs [7] . This model therefore identifies the rectifying I\u2013V relation of the calcium current in BCs as the first major non-linearity in retinal processing . The time-course of the presynaptic calcium signal in response to a visual stimulus was calculated by convolving the time-course of calcium influx with the \u201cpresynaptic calcium filter\u201d predicted by the one-compartment model , which has an impulse response decaying with time-constant \u03c4decay ( Figure 3E and 3F ) . The value of \u03c4decay depended on the radius of the terminal , according to the linear relation measured experimentally in Figure 3J . To test this model of calcium dynamics we compared its predictions with experimental measurements made with OGB-5N in BCs from slices of goldfish retina . The calcium concentration in the smaller of two connected synaptic compartments rose higher and faster , and then decayed almost to baseline after each cycle of a 1 Hz stimulus , while in the larger terminals there was an accumulation of calcium and much smaller modulations in concentration ( Figure 4B ) . The model could account for these differences by using the appropriate value of r while keeping all other variables constant ( Figure 4C ) . We considered two extensions of this model . The first is the use of three dimensions to estimate changes in calcium concentration at the active zone: this provided a very similar prediction to the one-compartment model ( Figure S3 ) . The second extension was to add active conductances in the terminal leading to calcium spikes , but again this did not alter the main conclusions that we could draw about the impact of terminal volume on gain and kinetics ( see below and Figure S6 ) . Having established that the model accounted adequately for variations in the presynaptic calcium signal , we extended it to explore the impact of terminal size on the kinetics of vesicle release . The following properties of exocytosis at the ribbon synapse of BCs were taken into account , all of which have been measured experimentally . The gain of signal transmission through the retina is not constant , but varies continuously according to the recent history of the stimulus [8] . Such plasticity has been studied particularly intensively in the context of adaptation after an increase in temporal contrast , which involves depression of excitatory synaptic transmission from BCs to RGCs [18] , [43] , [44] , likely reflecting depletion of rapidly releasable vesicles within the terminal [45]\u2013[47] . Might the size of BC terminals also impact on the process of contrast adaptation ? Larger BC terminals can contain hundreds of thousands of vesicles , and these are more mobile than in conventional synapses , acting to support the continuous mode of transmission [31] , [34] . It might therefore be expected that larger terminals containing more vesicles are more resistant to depression . To quantify time-dependent changes in synaptic gain we used an \u201cAdaptation Index\u201d ( AI ) , calculated as the ratio between the peak initial response to an increase in contrast and the later steady-state response . Using a stimulus of 100% contrast modulated at 5 Hz , and assuming a constant density of vesicles in terminals of different volume , the model predicted that the rate of vesicle release would depress more profoundly in smaller terminals ( Figure 6A and 6B ) . This can be understood in terms the RRP and IP depleting faster and to a lower steady-state in small terminals compared to large ( Figure 6A ) . Assaying vesicle release in vivo using sypHy confirmed that smaller terminals displayed greater depression ( Figure 6C ) , and AI decreased linearly with r ( Figure 6D ) . The absolute values of AI measured using sypHy were , however , lower than those predicted by the model: in the smallest terminals , an AI of \u223c2 . 5 was measured using sypHy , while the model predicted values of \u223c6 . This difference is likely to reflect the relatively low time-resolution of sypHy measurements , causing us to underestimate the initial peak release rate ( cf . Figure 6A ) . Nonetheless , the model and experimental measurements together demonstrate that the geometry of the presynaptic compartment is one of the factors determining the kinetics of vesicle depletion and , therefore , adaptation . It has recently been demonstrated that there are two opposing forms of plasticity when the retina responds to an increase in temporal contrast: while some BCs and ganglion cells adapt , others become sensitized [18] , [48] . The balance between adaptation and sensitization was also found to vary as a function of terminal size [14] , [18]; on average , larger terminals tended to show less adaptation ( Figure 6C ) with the largest terminals exhibiting sensitization ( Figure 6D ) . Sensitization of the BC output has been shown to result from reduced inhibition from amacrine cells [18] , [19] , [49] , and so is not predicted by the simple one compartment model . An empirical description of the relation between variations in the intensity of light falling on the retina and the spike-rate of ganglion cells can often be obtained using a model comprised of two stages: a linear transformation of the input feeding into a rectifying non-linearity [7] , [50] , [51] . How does this linear-nonlinear ( LN ) model map onto the retinal circuit [5] ? Transformations of the visual input are roughly linear through the processes of phototransduction and transmission by the synapses of photoreceptors , as far down the visual pathway as the cell body of BCs [22] , [43] , [52] , [53] . But what of the next neural compartment in the visual pathway\u2014the synaptic terminal of BCs ? Measurements of vesicle release with sypHy demonstrated strong rectification in the synaptic output because an increase in stimulus variance caused an increase in the mean rate of vesicle release even when the mean luminance was held constant , as shown in Figure 6C . This behavior is predicted by the model ( Figure 6A ) , where it reflects the rectifying relation between membrane potential and the amplitude of the calcium current ( Figure 4 ) . To test this explanation by experiment , we imaged the presynaptic calcium signal using SyGCaMP2 , while applying a square wave stimulus modulated at 3 Hz . Figure 7A compares the SyGCaMP2 signal averaged over two populations of terminals that generated a significant response to this stimulus: 66 with r<1 . 5 \u00b5m and 119 with r>2 . 5 \u00b5m . In both populations the presynaptic calcium signal was a strongly rectifying function of light intensity , causing a steady increase in calcium that was graded with contrast ( Figure 7B ) . These measurements identify voltage-dependent calcium channels in the synaptic terminal of BCs as being responsible for the first major non-linear transformation of the visual signal as it is transmitted through the retina . Although the most obvious aspect of the SyGCaMP2 signal elicited by an increase in the variance of the stimulus was a maintained increase in presynaptic calcium , smaller fluctuations could also be detected ( Figure 1G ) . The power of the fluctuations following a periodic stimulus was used to quantify the linear component of the synaptic calcium response [22] , and the power of this linear component was \u223c3-fold larger in the smaller population of terminals ( Figures 1G , 7C , and 7D ) . Further , when the contrast of the stimulus was varied between 10% and 100% , the power of the linear component was directly proportional to the power of the DC component ( Figure 7E ) , as predicted by the model ( Figure 7G ) . The proportionality constant for the small population of terminals was 2 . 4 times that of the large population ( Figure 7E ) , which was also predicted by the model . The relatively slow response time of SyGCaMP2 ( \u03c4decay\u223c200 ms [13] ) prevented the imaging of synaptic responses following stimuli at frequencies greater than 3 Hz , but the results in Figure 7 demonstrate that smaller terminals generate relatively stronger linear responses than large terminals , and therefore encode fluctuating stimuli more effectively . How do variations in filtering of the presynaptic calcium signal impact on the output from the synapse ? Assaying vesicle release with SypHy demonstrated that smaller terminals respond to a step of light with higher relative release rates ( Figure 1F ) , but the resolution of this reporter was too low to detect modulations at stimulus frequencies >1 Hz ( i . e . , the linear component of the output ) . Nonetheless , the model predicted that the modulation in release rate would be directly proportional to the steady rate once the terminal had adapted ( Figure 7F ) , and sypHy can be used to assess variations in the steady-rate of release [14] . We therefore used steady-state measurements to compare temporal filtering in the output of small and large terminals . Figure 8A shows averaged sypHy signals to stimuli of varying frequency , for two populations of terminals: small ( r<1 \u00b5m ) and large ( r>1 . 5 \u00b5m ) The amplitude of the response , reflecting the steady rate of vesicle release , is plotted as a function of frequency in Figure 8B . Small terminals transmitted frequencies between 5 and 10 Hz significantly better than large terminals . For instance , at a frequency of 8 Hz , the relative response of small terminals was \u223c2 . 4-fold that of large . If the power of the modulated response is proportional to the mean release rate , as suggested by the results in Figure 7E , these measurements can be considered an approximation of the \u201ctransfer function\u201d of the visual system up to the point that BCs transmit the visual signal . We therefore described the measurements using an expression commonly used to describe the output of electrical circuits with some element of resonance [54]:where A is a scaling factor , fo is the center frequency , and Q is a quality factor describing how much the response is damped . In small terminals , Q was estimated as 1 . 57\u00b10 . 37 , while in large terminals it was 0 . 78\u00b10 . 17 . Thus small terminals more obviously maintained the bandpass characteristics of the voltage signal measured in the cell body of BCs [22] , while large terminals damped out the resonant frequencies This behavior can now be understood in terms of the impact of terminal volume on the dynamics of the calcium signal controlling neurotransmitter release . \n The different temporal channels in the visual system were first distinguished by recording responses of \u201ctransient\u201d and \u201csustained\u201d ganglion cells in the retina [4] . These temporal channels partly reflect processing in the inner retina , where feedback inhibition and lateral inhibition from amacrine cells act directly on BC terminals to alter the gain and timing of the synaptic output [11] , [19] , [58] . Here we have described a fundamental and intrinsic property that will contribute further to the diversity of signals that BCs transmit\u2014the geometry of the synaptic compartment [11] , [55] , [56] . In the future , it will be important to assess the extent to which RGCs tuned to different frequencies receive inputs from BC terminals of different sizes . Such a study will be technically demanding , requiring a detailed anatomical reconstruction of IPL circuitry . Nonetheless , Figure 1D provides the first evidence that RGCs with dendrites in different layers of the IPL will , on average , receive excitatory input from BC terminals of different sizes . For instance , layer 6 of the IPL contains the highest density of large terminals , which leads to the testable prediction that RGCs extending dendrites in this layer will be more likely to exhibit low-pass characteristics . In contrast , layer 5 has smaller terminals than the average , suggesting that RGCs collecting inputs from this layer will be tuned to higher frequencies . The purpose of the model we have presented is to provide a basic mechanistic understanding for the impact of terminal volume on calcium dynamics and vesicle release from BCs . A more comprehensive model of signal transmission from BCs would not treat the neuron in isolation but would also consider the local circuits into which the terminals are connected . In particular we have neglected the effects of direct inhibitory feedback from amacrine cells [11] , [19] , [58] . It is , however , notable that when the GABAergic component of this feedback was blocked , the size-dependence of release rate was maintained ( Figure 2 ) , indicating that negative feedback was not the cause of this correlation . The temporal tuning of BCs also reflects processes in the outer retina , especially cone [59] inputs with different contact morphologies acting on dendritic glutamate receptors with different kinetics of recovery from desensitization [3] , [60] , [61] . The general picture that emerges is one in which amacrine cells modulate transmission of different frequency components in the visual input by acting on the background of at least two intrinsic properties varying between BCs: tuning of dendritic inputs summed at the cell body and the filter determining calcium dynamics in the synaptic terminal providing the output ( Figure 3G ) [62] . The key new idea that we propose here is that this synaptic filter varies between different outputs because of variations in an intrinsic property of the synaptic compartment\u2014its volume . It has long been recognized that the visual system separates signals encoding different aspects of a stimulus for transmission through different pathways or \u201cchannels . \u201d The most fundamental of these parallel representations is the separation of ON and OFF signals , which begins in distinct types of BC [63] . The separation of signals with different speeds into transient and sustained pathways also begins in BCs [6] . More than ten types of morphologically distinct BCs can be recognized in the vertebrate retina , and probably more than 20 in zebrafish [64] , [65] , but we still do not fully understand how these differ in their response properties . The general thinking has been that one type of BC transmits one type of signal , but more recent work indicates that it might be more fruitful to focus on the synaptic terminal as the fundamental unit of signal transmission , which would allow for divergence of different signals from the one neuron [11] . Implicit in this idea is the notion that the different synaptic outputs of a neuron are functionally isolated from each other , at least to some extent . Does the geometry of the terminal arborization allow this ? Simultaneous measurements of calcium signals in connected terminals demonstrate that the answer is yes: connecting processes provide a sufficient diffusional barrier to allow calcium signals with different amplitudes and kinetics to remain local to individual terminals ( Figure 3 ) . Such isolation of presynaptic calcium signals would also allow for independent modulation of different synaptic compartments by amacrine cells . The potential number and diversity of these synaptic transformations becomes even greater if one considers that individual amacrine cells provide negative feedback though many neurites with distinct biophysical and synaptic properties [66] . Such presynaptic heterogeneity has previously been observed in sensory pathways of insects , including cricket auditory afferents [67] and Drosophila olfactory receptor neurons [68] . \n All procedures were carried out according to the UK Animals ( Scientific Procedures ) Act 1986 and approved by the UK Home Office . Transgenic zebrafish expressing SyGCaMP2 . 0 and sypHy were maintained on a 14/10 h light/dark cycle at 28\u00b0C . From 24 hpf the larvae were maintained in fish medium ( E2 ) containing 1-phenyl-2-thiourea at a final concentration of 200 \u00b5M ( Sigma ) to prevent pigment formation . Fish were imaged as described previously [13] . Briefly , before experiments 8\u201310 dpf larvae were anesthetized in 0 . 016% Tricaine ( Sigma ) and immobilized in low melting point agarose . To prevent eye movement \u03b1-bungarotoxin ( 2 mg/ml ) was injected into the extraocular space . Imaging was performed using a custom-built multiphoton microscope , equipped with a mode-locked Chameleon titanium-sapphire laser ( Coherent ) tuned to 920 nm and controlled using ScanImage v . 3 . 6 software [69] . The retina was imaged through an Olympus LUMPlanFI 40\u00d7 water immersion ( 0 . 8 NA ) objective . Green emission from sypHy and SyGCaMP2 was collected both through the objective and through an oil condenser ( ND 1 . 4 , Olympus ) , filtered through GFP filters ( 530/50 nm , Chroma Technology ) , and detected with GaAsP photomultipliers ( Hamamatsu ) . Images ( 128\u00d7128 pixels ) were acquired every 0 . 128 seconds , resulting in a sampling frequency of 7 . 8 Hz . Full-field light stimuli were delivered using an amber LED ( 590 nm ) filtered through a 600/10 BP filter and projected through a light guide onto the surface of the bath , close to the eye of the fish . The mean intensity of light stimuli was \u223c2\u00d7105 photons/\u00b5m2/s , which is in the low photopic range . Importantly , optical measurements in the live retina necessarily give rise to a background activation of photoreceptors . This is due to direct laser activation of photopigment , but usually more importantly , due to indirect activation of photopigments from the emission light of excited fluophores [70] . As a result , rods are typically saturated , and cones partially adapted , giving rise to a low-photopic background light-level . Indeed , we observed similar effects in our in vivo experiments ( Figure S1F ) . However , this background illumination was weaker than typically observed in e . g . , rabbit [70] , presumably as the zebrafish retina is cone dominated . Nevertheless , following activation of the laser scanning , we typically waited 30 seconds before commencing with additional visual stimulation to ensure the retina adapted to the background levels attributed to the laser . Movies were processed using the SARFIA suite of analysis routines [17] running in Igor Pro 6 ( Wavemetrics ) . We detected terminals on the basis of single images obtained by averaging many frames of the movie corresponding to total integration times of several tens of seconds . ROIs corresponding to terminals within these averaged images were defined using a filtering algorithm based on a Laplace operator followed by application of a threshold , as described in detail in [17] . This algorithm will define most or all of the ROIs that an experienced observer would recognize by eye . To prevent bias between ON and OFF terminals within a single field of view , the average image was obtained from movies in which light steps were applied , and/or light intensity modulated at 1 Hz or faster . The point-spread function of the used microscope in XY dimension was 0 . 5 \u00b5m and terminals appeared larger when we increased intensity of the 2-photon laser . We therefore tested whether terminals might appear smaller when less active , but found that this was not the case ( as described in Figure S1 and Text S1 ) . Average terminal sizes were similar between different fish ( Figure S5A ) and the effects of terminal size on adaptation kinetics could be observed in individual fish ( Figure S5B ) as well as in data averaged over multiple fish ( Figure 6C ) . However , the distribution of estimated terminal sizes in SyGCaMP2 was shifted to larger values , compared to sypHy or Synaptophysin-EGFP fish ( Figure S1H ) . This is likely explained by the greater overall brightness of SyGCaMP2 . The z-resolution of the microscope was \u223c2 \u00b5m . Given an average radius of just above 1 micron per terminal , this resolution was therefore large enough to avoid underestimating the size of terminals traversed non-centrally by the optical plane , but small enough to avoid out-of-focus terminals contributing to the signal . All statistical analysis was performed in Igor Pro 7 ( Wavemetrics ) . Differences in different parameters in large and small terminals , described in Figure 3 , were analyzed using Wilcoxon signed-rank test . This test was chosen because some responses of large and small terminals were recorded from the same neuron . Sample sizes were not determined a priori . Analysis of the response dynamic was automatic and no knowledge of terminal size was used until the last moment . All animals demonstrating robust response to light were included in the analysis . Figure 1B represents biological replicate , representative from more than five fields of view . No lack of reproducibility was found . All error bars in figures show \u00b1 1 SEM , unless stated otherwise in the legend . V\u2032exo , the fraction of total vesicles in the terminal released per second , was calculated from the sypHy signal according to the equation: ( 1 ) where F is the average fluorescence intensity over the terminal at time t , Fmin is the intensity when the rate of vesicle release is at a minimum , and kendo is the rate-constant of vesicle retrieval . The calculation of this formula is described in [14] , [18] . Estimation of V\u2032exo requires differentiation of the sypHy trace , which in turn amplifies noise , so Equation 1 was applied after smoothing with a series of single or double exponential functions to obtain \u201cnon-noisy\u201d traces before calculation of V\u2032exo . These fits are shown in Figures 1F and 5C . Slices of goldfish retina were perfused with extracellular solution containing ( in mM ) 120 NaCl , 2 . 5 CaCl2 , 2 KCl , 1 MgCl2 , 0 . 1 CaCl2 , 4 HEPES , 10 glucose ( pH 7 . 7 , 255 mOsm ) . Experiments were carried out at room temperature and slices visualized under oblique infrared illumination through a 60\u00d7 objective ( NA 0 . 9 ) on an upright microscope . Whole cell recordings were obtained from \u201clarge\u201d terminals ( diameter: 4\u201312 \u00b5m ) or from the soma of \u201cmixed\u201d BCs using 8\u201312 M\u03a9 patch electrodes [71] . For this , we targeted large terminals in layers 5/6 . The intracellular solution contained ( in mM ) 104 Kgluconate , 8 KCl , 2 MgCl2 , 4 HEPES , 0 . 5 EGTA , 2 MgATP , 1 NaGTP , 1 NacGMP ( pH 7 . 4 , 250 Osm ) , and 100 \u00b5M of the hexapotassium salt of the low affinity Ca2+ indicator OGB-5N . Recordings were left for 1\u20135 min to allow time for the Ca2+-indicator to diffuse into adjacent small terminals ( diameter 1\u20134 \u00b5m ) see also [20] . Series resistance ranged from 8\u201315 M\u03a9 while input resistance was >1 G\u03a9 at \u221270 mV . Recordings were corrected for junction potentials ( calculated as \u221211 . 95 mV ) . OGB-5N was imaged at 40 Hz using an electron multiplying charge coupled device ( EM CCD ) camera ( Hamamatsu C9100 ) . Subsequent image analysis was performed using ImageJ , Igor Pro , and Matlab . OGB-5N signals were quantified as changes in fluorescence relative to background fluorescence at each pixel ( \u0394F/Fo ) and converted to estimates of absolute Ca2+ concentration: ( 2 ) Fmax/Fmin of OGB-5N is \u223c14 . 7 . Since resting Ca2+ in bipolar terminals ( \u223c50 nM [30] ) is much lower than the Kd of OGB-5N ( 20 \u00b5M ) we assumed that Frest\u200a=\u200aFmin .", "headings": ["Abstract", "Introduction", "Results", "Discussion", "Materials and Methods"], "keywords": ["neuroscience", "visual system", "biology and life sciences", "sensory systems"], "id": "journal.pbio.1001972"}
{"lay_summary": "Brain function results from communication between neurons connected by complex synaptic networks . Synapses are themselves highly complex and diverse signaling machines , containing protein products of hundreds of different genes , some in hundreds of copies , precisely arranged at each individual synapse . Synapses are fundamental not only to synaptic network function but also to network development , adaptation , and memory . In addition , abnormalities of synapse numbers or their molecular components have been implicated in a variety of mental and neurological disorders . Despite their obvious importance , mammalian synapse populations have so far resisted detailed quantitative study . In human brains and most animal nervous systems , synapses are very small and very densely packed: there are approximately 1 billion synapses per cubic millimeter of human cortex . This volumetric density poses very substantial challenges to proteometric analysis at the critical level of the individual synapse . The present work describes new probabilistic image analysis methods suitable for single-synapse analysis of synapse populations in both animal and human brains , in health and disorder .", "article": "Deeper exploration of the brain\u2019s vast synaptic networks will require new tools for high-throughput structural and molecular profiling of the diverse populations of synapses that compose those networks . Fluorescence microscopy ( FM ) and electron microscopy ( EM ) offer complementary advantages and disadvantages for single-synapse analysis . FM combines exquisite molecular discrimination capacities with high speed and low cost , but rigorous discrimination between synaptic and non-synaptic fluorescence signals is challenging . In contrast , EM remains the gold standard for reliable identification of a synapse , but offers only limited molecular discrimination and is slow and costly . To develop and test single-synapse image analysis methods , we have used datasets from conjugate array tomography ( cAT ) , which provides voxel-conjugate FM and EM ( annotated ) images of the same individual synapses . We report a novel unsupervised probabilistic method for detection of synapses from multiplex FM ( muxFM ) image data , and evaluate this method both by comparison to EM gold standard annotated data and by examining its capacity to reproduce known important features of cortical synapse distributions . The proposed probabilistic model-based synapse detector accepts molecular-morphological synapse models as user queries , and delivers a volumetric map of the probability that each voxel represents part of a synapse . Taking human annotation of cAT EM data as ground truth , we show that our algorithm detects synapses from muxFM data alone as successfully as human annotators seeing only the muxFM data , and accurately reproduces known architectural features of cortical synapse distributions . This approach opens the door to data-driven discovery of new synapse types and their density . We suggest that our probabilistic synapse detector will also be useful for analysis of standard confocal and super-resolution FM images , where EM cross-validation is not practical . \n Deeper understanding of the basic mechanisms and pathologies of the brain\u2019s synaptic networks will require advances in our quantitative understanding of structural , molecular , and functional diversity within the vast populations of individual synapses that define those networks [1] [2] [3] [4] . Regardless of the subject of interest , synapse heterogeneity makes assay at the single-synapse level paramount . Here , we introduce and characterize a novel image analysis method for automated detection and molecular measurement of individual synapses and single-synapse molecular profiling of diverse synapse populations from multiplex fluorescence microscopy ( muxFM ) image data . The proposed methodology for structural identification and molecular analysis of single synapses at scale will be an enabling step toward deeper experimental analysis of the relationships between synaptic structure , molecules , and function . Reliable , high-throughput methods for large-scale synapse detection will also help to analyze volume images large enough to contain complete neural arbors , and thus to allow discernment of the relationships between detected synapses and their presynaptic and postsynaptic parent neurons [5] . The synapse detection methodology described here is not the first to grapple with the challenges of detecting synapses in immunofluorescence images [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . The special utility and novelty of this tool partially lies in ( 1 ) producing outputs in the form of probability maps , reflecting the limited certainty with which synapses can be detected by most experimental modalities [11] , and ( 2 ) the superior utility for both interactive and algorithmic exploration which is conferred by the query-based architecture resulting from the unsupervised framework . The probabilistic detection algorithm we introduce has perhaps its closest precedent in probabilistic synapse detectors that were introduced recently for the analysis of Focussed Ion Beam Scanning Electron Microscope ( FIBSEM ) images [12] [13] . The relationship in particular with [8] will be further discussed later in this paper . Single-synapse profiling of large and diverse synapse populations poses formidable challenges [14] [15] [16] . Electron microscopy ( EM ) of appropriately labeled specimens defines the current \u2018gold standard\u2019 for synapse detection: the nanometer resolution of EM is necessary for the unambiguous identification of defining synaptic features such as presynaptic vesicles , synaptic clefts , and postsynaptic densities [17] [18] . Unfortunately EM data acquisition is technically difficult , slow , burdened by large data processing and storage requirements , and offers only limited capacities to discriminate amongst the hundreds of different synaptic proteins that constitute the synaptic proteome . In contrast , fluorescence microscopy ( FM ) of tagged specimens is much faster and less expensive , easier to segment for analysis , and offers much greater molecular discrimination power . Unfortunately , the ability of FM to detect and discriminate individual synapses is compromised by resolution limits and the close crowding of synapses in most neural tissue specimens of interest . Robust FM detection of synapses is nonetheless potentially possible by combining measures that extend resolution limits and multiplexing for localization and co-localization of synaptic markers . In designing the algorithm and software reported here , we first relied on images acquired with conjugate array tomography ( cAT ) , which combines the strengths of FM-AT with those of electron microscopic array tomography ( EM-AT ) , allowing both EM and muxFM imaging of individual cortical specimens . Array tomography\u2019s ultrathin physical sectioning provides z-axis resolution far beyond the light microscopic diffraction limit , as well as high sensitivity and high lateral resolution , while greatly simplifying voxel-conjugate registration of FM-AT and EM-AT images . FM-AT can moreover multiplex large numbers of synaptic markers by its combination of sequential and spectral label multiplexing . Thus , cAT provides an ideal platform for the development and rigorous design and testing of algorithms aimed at single-synapse molecular analysis and population molecular profiling . The remarkable structural and molecular diversity within mammalian synapse populations challenges our present biological understanding of how to define a synapse [11] . Difficulties also arise from a very broad distribution of synapse size , with the smallest synapses occurring at the highest frequencies . Thus , detection of a synapse inevitably involves setting some minimum-size criterion for any candidate cell-cell contact specialization to qualify as a synapse . For FM , the \u2018size\u2019 metric is typically the intensity of one or more fluorescent synaptic protein tags . The fact that there are clearly non-synaptic \u2018backgrounds\u2019 , and that the observed size distributions are log-normal , enforces high sensitivity of synapse detection on some rather arbitrary threshold minimum size value . This sensitivity in turn makes key results of widespread interest , such as the synaptic density in a region or the presence/absence of a synapse at a given microscopic site , uncomfortably dependent on that same size threshold value . The probabilistic synapse detector proposed here may lead both to relief from such arbitrary-threshold ( parameters ) and to improvements in our biological understanding of what defines a synapse . The unsupervised probabilistic synapse detector reported here accepts molecular-morphological synapse models in the form of user queries , and delivers a volumetric map of the probability that each voxel represents part of a synapse . These maps can then be used directly to detect , classify , and map putative synapses , with confidence statistics for each . Taking human annotation of cAT EM data as ground truth , we show that our algorithm detects synapses from muxFM data alone as effectively as human annotators ( while seeing only the muxFM data ) , and can reproduce known architectural features of cortical synapse distributions . The algorithm is actually validated with the most comprehensive AT datasets currently available . Though we here address only array tomography image data , our probabilistic synapse detector may also be useful for analysis of widely available confocal and super-resolution FM images . \n The proposed algorithm is inspired from biological knowledge of synapse characteristics . Synapses include two major structural components: a presynaptic terminal and a postsynaptic terminal . Detecting synapses using data from immunofluorescence imaging involves identifying such adjacent presynaptic and postsynaptic antibody markers , as shown in Fig 1 , which diagrams the locations of four major excitatory synaptic proteins . Fig 2 is an example of an excitatory synapse with images of presynaptic and postsynaptic antibody markers ( synapsin and PSD-95 ) overlaid upon an EM image . For this example , only two antibody markers are shown for visual simplicity\u2014in practice , any number of presynaptic or postsynaptic antibody markers may be used by the proposed algorithm for synapse detection . Manual synapse identification involves determining the punctum size and brightness in one channel , and then considering adjacency to similarly-defined puncta in other channels . However , without corresponding EM data , detections using only IF data have an associated degree of uncertainty . Thus , we propose a query-based probabilistic synapse detection method that reflects the thought process underlying expert manual synapse detection . The first step is to distinguish signal from background noise . This calculation encodes the probability that the pixel value represents authentic antigen detection . The second step is to determine whether the foreground pixels correspond to a 2D punctum , since photons emanating from only a single pixel usually reflect noise . Therefore , adjacent \u2018positive\u2019 pixels , more likely to reflect a synaptic punctum , are augmented . Third , puncta that span multiple slices have a higher probability of belonging to a synapse than those that do not . To visualize this effect , the probability of a punctum belonging to a synapse is attenuated based on whether the prospective punctum spans multiple slices . The last step in computing the synapse probability map is to evaluate the presence of adjacent presynaptic and postsynaptic puncta by correlating the corresponding IF volumes . This produces a probability map , where the value at each voxel is the probability it belongs to a synapse . This algorithm provides a general framework for the evaluation of a wide variety of synapse subtypes , user-defined by setting the presynaptic and postsynaptic antibodies and puncta size . The following sections describe in detail each step in the process , as diagrammed in Fig 3 . Before that , let us relate our proposed approach with the current state-of-the-art method [8] , which inspired this work . The method in [8] requires manually annotating a large number of excitatory synapses using the EM data , and then using this as labeled data for training ( supervised training ) . EM data allows the user to differentiate between symmetric and asymmetric synapses , but does not allow for subtype identification ( limited labels/supervision ) . Thus , the support vector machine ( SVM ) classifier used in [8] is trained with synapses containing the marker for PSD-95 , but does not take into account synapses without the PSD-95 marker ( limited classes in the supervision ) . In contrast , the approach here proposed and detailed below is unsupervised , allowing the user to detect synapses with multiple proteometric compositions without first using other methods to identify large numbers of synapses for training . Our proposed approach does not require the user to manually inspect associated EM for training data; in fact , we do not require associated EM data with the IF data . Instead , we enable the user to \u2018define\u2019 ( biologically inspired ) a synapse by specifying which synaptic markers should be present ( query ) and what the minimum size of those markers should be , allowing a more class specific synaptic search . This is critical also for the discovery of new types of synapses , exploitation of new markers , and data-based discovery . The method in [8] will need re-training for every new class they want to find in the IF ( potentially even new data acquisition protocols as well ) . There is a direct numerical comparison of the two methods in the experimental section , showing that the proposed algorithm is not only unsupervised and more broadly applicable than [8] , but it actually outperforms it in the cases where both methods can be used . Raw immunofluorescence image data is noisy; for example , speckles of the antibody markers often bind with cellular structures not associated with synapses , such as mitochondria . In addition , fluorescence imagery contains signal from sources other than fluorescently-labelled antibodies , e . g . from background autofluorescence . Finally , all digital imagery contains inherent noise from sources such as camera read noise and photon shot noise . The noise produced by these sources is usually smaller in magnitude than that originating from authentic synaptic labeling , but it cannot simply be filtered out and dismissed from consideration , since the signal may originate from a true synaptic site , and we want to allow for the possibility that a concordance of weak evidence will lead to the detection of a synapse . Thus , the first step of the algorithm consists of differentiating the bright voxels , the foreground ( potential objects of interest ) , from a noisy background in a probabilistic fashion . IF data volumes , when stained for synaptic markers , are also extremely sparse\u2014approximately 2% of the voxels in the dataset belong to the foreground , as indicated in Fig 4 . Therefore , the IF image volume can be used to approximate the distribution of the background noise . Let v ( x , y , z ) be the intensity value of a voxel at position ( x , y ) in slice z , for a given channel of the IF data . A probabilistic model , pB , is computed which characterizes all the pixels that belong to the background , which includes approximately 98% of the voxels . The background noise model is computed independently for each slice to account for variations in tissue and imaging properties . The background model pB is assumed to be a Gaussian distribution , whose mean and variance ( \u03bc B , \u03c3 B 2 ) are empirically computed from each slice z ( the z index is omitted in Eq 1 for simplicity of notation ) . Then , the probability of a voxel belonging to the background , i . e . not being \u2018bright\u2019 , is given by p B ( x , y , z ) = 1 \u03c3 B 2 \u03c0 \u222b v ( x , y , z ) \u221e e - ( t - \u03bc B ) 2 2 \u03c3 B 2 d t . ( 1 ) Therefore , the probability of a voxel associated with the foreground , pF , is computed as p F ( x , y , z ) = 1 - p B ( x , y , z ) . ( 2 ) Fig 5 shows an example of the transformation from the raw data to the foreground probability map . Once foreground pixels have been identified in a probabilistic fashion , the next step is to determine if they form a 2D punctum . Since synapses appear as bright puncta in the IF image data , voxels which form puncta should have a higher probability of being associated with a synapse than those which do not . The probability of a voxel belonging to a 2D punctum , pP , is computed by multiplying the voxel\u2019s foreground probability by that of its neighbors in a predefined neighborhood region , p P ( x , y , z ) = \u220f i = x - W x + W \u220f j = y - W y + W p F ( i , j , z ) , ( 3 ) where W is the neighborhood size , defined by the smallest expected punctum size . These operations are analogous to applying a box filter on the logarithm of the probability map , for computational efficiency . In our experiments , W was set to be slightly larger than the size of the point spread function of the microscopes used . Fig 6 shows an example of the foreground probability map and the corresponding 2D puncta probability map . This step transforms each pixel\u2019s value from representing the probability it belongs to the foreground to the probability it belongs to both the foreground and to a punctum . Potential synaptic puncta can span multiple slices of a given channel; puncta that span multiple slices have a higher probability of being associated with a synapse than those that do not . Therefore , we propose a factor f ( x , y , z ) which diminishes the probability values associated with voxels which do not maintain a similar probability value in adjacent slices , f ( x , y , z ) = exp - \u2211 j = j s t a r t j = j e n d [ p P ( x , y , z ) - p P ( x , y , z + j ) ] 2 . ( 4 ) The pixel\u2019s 2D puncta probability is compared to that of its neighbor in slice ( s ) before , jstart , and slice ( s ) after , jend . The number of slices compared is dependent on the input size parameter for each antibody . The factor attenuates values for 2D puncta that do not span the required number of slices , as shown in Fig 7 . The 3D puncta probability map is then computed by multiplying the 2D puncta probability map by this factor , p 3 D P ( x , y , z ) = p P ( x , y , z ) f ( x , y , z ) , ( 5 ) which further improves the probability of a detection by considering the slice-to-slice spatial distribution , going from 2D to 3D . In electron microscopic images , synapses are identified by the presence of synaptic vesicles on the presynaptic side , the close adjacency of the membranes of the presynaptic axon terminal to a postsynaptic dendrite or dendritic spine , and the presence of a distinct postsynaptic specialization , as diagrammed in Fig 1 . Synapses are identified in IF data by the close spatial arrangement of pre- and postsynaptic antibody markers , which correspond to proteins associated with synapses . Therefore , the next step in our approach is to look for the presence of presynaptic puncta in the neighborhood of postsynaptic puncta . More precisely , for each postsynaptic antibody voxel ( i . e . , PSD-95 ) , we search in the adjacent 3D neighborhood of the corresponding presynaptic ( i . e . , synapsin ) volume for a high intensity probability signal . To accomplish this , a rectangular grid is defined in the presynaptic channels around each postsynaptic voxel , as shown in Fig 8 . The size of the grid is defined by the initial query parameters , which depend on both the inherent biology and microscope resolution . The logarithm of the 3D puncta probability map Eq ( 5 ) is integrated in each grid location and the maximum is taken as presynaptic signal level around the given postsynaptic location , log p p r e s = max k \u2211 G k log p 3 D P ( p r e s y n a p t i c ) , ( 6 ) where the grid G is centered at the current voxel ( x , y , z ) and divided into K \u00d7 K \u00d7 K subregions Gk . To search in a grid around a defined voxel location for the presynaptic signal , K is set to 3 . When searching for the postsynaptic signal , K is set to 1 since postsynaptic signals are expected to loosely co-localize . These values can be adopted to the data resolution . The postsynaptic antibody pixel probability p p o s t = p 3 D P ( p o s t s y n a p t i c ) , ( 7 ) is multiplied by the presynaptic probability to obtain the desired probability map: p s y n a p ( x , y , z ) = p p r e s ( x , y , z ) p p o s t ( x , y , z ) . ( 8 ) Again , the probability information is here maintained ( Fig 9 ) , now including the morphological relationship between the channels . This \u2018grid\u2019 like approach allows the method to be robust to slight image alignment and registration issues , as well as to deconvolution artifacts . \n The proposed method was evaluated on the array tomography dataset published in [19] , which contains a portion of the mouse barrel cortex extending from Layer 3 to Layer 5 . Unlike the conjugate array tomography dataset , there is no associated EM imagery . This larger series of datasets includes 11 volumes representing a total of 2 , 306 , 233 \u03bcm3 of cortical volume . Since no gold standard is available for these data , the proposed method was evaluated by verifying known properties of the dataset: there is an approximately ten-to-one ratio of excitatory to inhibitory synapses [24] , and there are more inhibitory synapses in Layer 4 than Layer 5 in the mouse barrel cortex [25] [26] [27] . For this dataset , the query parameters were adjusted to reflect the different synaptic markers used . Tables 7 and 8 list the query parameters used for detecting both inhibitory and excitatory synapses , similar to those in [7] [8] [19] . \n The proposed synapse detection method serves the potential future needs of both basic and clinical neuroscience . Methods for large-scale synapse detection could analyze image volumes large enough to contain complete neural arbors , and thus allow the discernment of the relationships between detected synapses and their presynaptic and postsynaptic parent neurons . An understanding of the statistics of synapse variation in any given synaptic network is certain to be critical to interpreting and modeling results of mechanistic physiological study . Moreover , advances in imaging methods for tracing complete axonal and dendritic arbors [35] are likely to allow network analyses at the level of individual neurons and their synaptic connections , which might be optimally detected and measured by probabilistic means like those introduced here . When combined with complete arbor measurements [36] , emerging methods for in situ measurement of single-cell transcriptomes [37] should allow single-synapse measurements to be associated with specific presynaptic and postsynaptic parent neurons of known transcriptomic profiles . Such capacities are likely to enhance our understanding of the molecular origins of synapse diversity . On the clinical side , the analysis tool we introduce here is likely to advance our abilities to detect possible abnormalities of synapse population statistics that have long been hypothesized to underlie a wide variety of mental and neurological disorders [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] . Quantification of synapse populations , in human postmortem and biopsy specimens , [45] , and in animal models of disease , has already provided important insights into disease etiologies [39] [45] [42] . More reliable measurements based on probabilistic tools like those introduced here seem likely to facilitate future efforts to better understand disease mechanisms and to develop the quantitative assays essential to the discovery of effective therapies [46] . This work introduces a model-based unsupervised synapse detection algorithm that incorporates fundamental biological knowledge of how synapses are identified in the immunofluorescence data . We created a series of probabilistic excitatory detectors for various subtypes of synapses , and included the 3D spatial relationships typical of synaptic structures . This novel approach provides a probabilistic-based detection algorithm yielding not only detection but detection with confidence values . The implementation of synapse detection as a probability map ( i . e . , probability of each pixel belonging to a synapse ) , as opposed to a binary detection / no-detection result may provide a powerful tool to assist experts throughout the exploratory process to gain new insights from the immunofluorescence data , including potentially discovering new subtypes of synapses . The influence of different biological and AT components on the actual probability values , from the noise of the system to the expression level of the proteins and the subclass of the synapses , an important new topic of investigation , will become possible when the proposed algorithm is applied to large new datasets , currently being generated . Creating conjugate Array Tomography datasets require specialized equipment , including the use of a Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope ( FESEM ) to provide ground truth validation of synapse results . The computational work presented in this paper , together with the publicly available code and data , is a step in the direction of making this kind of analysis robust enough to no longer require expensive FESEM validation . The algorithm is computationally very simple and the only parameters are the user\u2019s definition of a synapse subtype , rendering it ready for massive datasets . The results were validated with the best available cAT and AT data , producing state-of-the-art results without the need for supervised training . As demonstrated here , the proposed framework can be exploited for the explicit detection of synapses or their properties , the latter being critical for the discovery of new subtypes as well as the patterns of distributions of known subtypes . These , and the potential consequences of the approach here proposed to other modalities , are the subjects of our current efforts .", "headings": ["Abstract", "Introduction", "Methods", "Results", "Discussion"], "keywords": ["medicine and health sciences", "diagnostic radiology", "neural networks", "nervous system", "applied mathematics", "vertebrates", "electrophysiology", "light microscopy", "neuroscience", "animals", "mammals", "simulation and modeling", "algorithms", "mathematics", "microscopy", "research and analysis methods", "computer and information sciences", "imaging techniques", "fluorescence microscopy", "tomography", "image analysis", "radiology and imaging", "diagnostic medicine", "anatomy", "synapses", "cats", "physiology", "biology and life sciences", "physical sciences", "amniotes", "neurophysiology", "organisms"], "id": "journal.pcbi.1005493"}
{"lay_summary": "Herein we explored the mechanism of action of the human ZnT2 zinc transporter . ZnT2 is essential for zinc accumulation in breast milk and is therefore of paramount medical significance . Expanding on our previous study , we herein present energy calculations suggesting that ZnT2 functions as a proton/zinc antiporter . Our calculations consist of electrostatic and pKa calculations as well as zinc binding free-energy curves . Upon integration of our calculation results , we conclude that ZnT2 functions as an antiporter with a 2H+/Zn2+ stoichiometry , construct a Monte Carlo model to test this mode of ZnT2 transport activity , and validate our computational results experimentally using live human breast epithelial cells . These functional experiments reveal that ZnT2 cannot function in the absence of protons suggesting that it operates as a substrate-induced alternating-access transporter , displaying an apparent 2H+/Zn2+ stoichiometry .", "article": "Zinc is a vital trace element crucial for the proper function of some 3 , 000 cellular proteins . Specifically , zinc is essential for key physiological processes including nucleic acid metabolism , regulation of gene expression , signal transduction , cell division , immune- and nervous system functions , wound healing , and apoptosis . Consequently , impairment of zinc homeostasis disrupts key cellular functions resulting in various human pathologies . Mammalian zinc transport proceeds via two transporter families ZnT and ZIP . However , the detailed mechanism of action of ZnT2 , which is responsible for vesicular zinc accumulation and zinc secretion into breast milk during lactation , is currently unknown . Moreover , although the putative coupling of zinc transport to the proton gradient in acidic vesicles has been suggested , it has not been conclusively established . Herein we modeled the mechanism of action of ZnT2 and demonstrated both computationally and experimentally , using functional zinc transport assays , that ZnT2 is indeed a proton-coupled zinc antiporter . Bafilomycin A1 , a specific inhibitor of vacuolar-type proton ATPase ( V-ATPase ) which alkalizes acidic vesicles , abolished ZnT2-dependent zinc transport into intracellular vesicles . Moreover , using LysoTracker Red and Lyso-pHluorin , we further showed that upon transient ZnT2 overexpression in intracellular vesicles and addition of exogenous zinc , the vesicular pH underwent alkalization , presumably due to a proton-zinc antiport; this phenomenon was reversed in the presence of TPEN , a specific zinc chelator . Finally , based on computational energy calculations , we propose that ZnT2 functions as an antiporter with a stoichiometry of 2H+/Zn2+ ion . Hence , ZnT2 is a proton motive force-driven , electroneutral vesicular zinc exchanger , concentrating zinc in acidic vesicles on the expense of proton extrusion to the cytoplasm . \n Divalent zinc ions are key and integral components of a multitude of proteins involved in a plethora of essential physiological processes including metabolism of nucleic acids , regulation of gene expression , signal transduction , cell division , immune- and nervous-system functions , wound healing , as well as apoptosis [1\u20134] . As such , it is crucial for cells to be efficiently shuttle zinc to- and from their surroundings , between organelles and distinct compartments . Mammalian zinc transporters belong to two families , ZnT and ZIP , canonically exporting and importing zinc , respectively . Specifically , ZnT2 plays a crucial role in concentrating zinc within secretory vesicles which were suggested to release zinc into breast milk during lactation [5] . In fact , exclusively breastfed infants nursed by mothers harboring loss-of-function mutations in ZnT2 suffer from transient neonatal zinc deficiency ( TNZD ) , which leads to severe zinc deficiency in these infants ( e . g . [6\u201312] ) . Furthermore , ZnT2 was shown to have a critical role in the development and normal function of the mouse mammary gland [13] , as well as in involution [14 , 15] . Taken together , expanding our mechanistic understanding of ZnT2 function , will provide valuable information with important physiological and possible therapeutic implications . ZnT2 was first identified by Palmiter et al . , in 1996 [16] , and was the second zinc transporter to be described in the literature . Unlike ZnT1 which is localized in the plasma membrane , ZnT2 is localized in intracellular vesicles where it plays a crucial role in zinc sequestration , hence conferring upon cells protection against zinc toxicity [16] . However , the driving force for ZnT2-dependent concentration of zinc inside secretory vesicles is currently unsettled . The first efforts to characterize the driving force of active zinc transport by ZnT2 made use of Bafilomycin A1 ( BafA1 ) , a specific inhibitor of the vacuolar-type proton ATPase ( V-ATPase ) which abolishes vesicular acidification [16] . Under this experimental setting , vesicular zinc accumulation was not disrupted by BafA1 , leading to the conclusion that ZnT2 function is not dependent on a proton gradient [16] . However , it was later shown that YiiP , the bacterial homolog of the ZnT family , is a H+/Zn2+ exchanger displaying a 1:1 stoichiometry [17] . Furthermore , Ohana et al . , proposed that the zinc transport function of ZnT5 proceeds via a H+/Zn2+ exchange [18] and a similar mechanism was suggested for ZnT1 [19] . Since the subcellular localization of ZnT2 maps to acidic intracellular organelles [5 , 15 , 16] , a putative H+/Zn2+ exchange mechanism is plausible for ZnT2 as well [5 , 20] . Thus , the current study was undertaken to establish the driving force of ZnT2 and assess its stoichiometry . In a recent study , we have delineated the putative zinc permeation pathway through the human ZnT2 [21] . Using computational and evolutionary considerations , we determined the residues contributing to the zinc binding site , and modeled the inward- and outward-facing ( cytoplasmic- and vesicular lumen-facing , respectively ) conformations of ZnT2 . In the current study , we expanded our previous findings and computed pKa values for the titratable residues at the putative binding site of ZnT2 ( see Fig 1 ) and calculated zinc binding free-energies . Our computations were integrated into a free-energy landscape and we constructed a mechanistic model for the function of ZnT2 . We tested our model using Monte Carlo ( MC ) simulations and surmised that ZnT2 is a proton-coupled zinc transporter . We then proceeded to functionally validate our hypothesis by determining changes in vesicular-zinc accumulation after treatment with BafA1 , a specific inhibitor of V-ATPase which abolishes vesicular acidification , using FluoZin3-AM , a zinc-sensitive fluorescent probe in live human MCF-7 cells . In addition , we used pH-dependent fluorescent probes , to evaluate the impact of ZnT2 overexpression and zinc accumulation on the intravesicular pH . Finally , we demonstrated experimentally that ZnT2 is indeed proton-gradient-dependent , and we predicted the H+/Zn2+ stoichiometry of transport to be 2:1 . Taken together , the current study highlights the synergistic strength of combining modeling and computational techniques with experimental functional validation . Our findings reveal an important aspect of ZnT2 and expand our understanding of this important transporter at the molecular level . \n The structural model for the simulation systems of ZnT2 in the inward-facing ( IF ) and outward-facing ( OF ) conformations were based on our recent study [21] , in which PDB IDs 3H90 ( x-ray at 2 . 9\u00c5 resolution [22] ) and 5VRF ( cryo-EM at 4 . 1\u00c5 resolution [23] ) were used as templates for the OF and IF conformations , respectively ( see S1 Text for a brief summary of the modeling process ) . For each system , the transporter homodimer was inserted into a 30 \u00c5-thick particle grid emulating a hydrophobic membrane using the MOLARIS software package [24 , 25] . The gap between the protomers was treated as part of the membrane milieu , as this gap exists within the expected membrane space and it is suggested to be non-functional [23] . Then , the systems were hydrated with a 40 \u00c5-radius water sphere , using explicit 3-particle water molecules , and were submitted to energy minimization using the steepest descent algorithm followed by a short local relaxation simulation of 100 ps using the MOLARIS software package . Relaxation was performed in the presence of a zinc ion at the putative binding site ( based on the structures of 3H90 and 5VRF ) , to prevent charge repulsion between the binding site residues . Binding energy curves were derived from our previous study [21] . Briefly , the zinc ion was positioned along the permeation pathway at 1 \u00c5 intervals along the z-axis . For each such position , 10 PDLD/S-LRA calculations ( see below ) were performed entailing an additional short relaxation step of 10\u201320 ps , allowing the transporter to relax around the new position of the zinc ion , while the zinc ion can freely move in the xy-plane . Several such trajectories were computed and the average value for all points was finally used in this study ( see our recent study [21] for more details and for the complete data ) . The binding energy calculation for each position point was performed using the scaled semi-macroscopic Protein Dipoles Langevin Dipoles approach ( PDLD/S ) of MOLARIS [24] . Water in this method is represented semi-macroscopically by Langevin dipoles . The energy is the average of the charged and uncharged states , following the linear response approximation ( LRA ) , scaled using a dielectric constant \u03b5 = 8 for the protein . Convergence was achieved by running molecular dynamics ( MD ) simulations for the relaxation and averaging the results of the different conformations [26] . The calculations were performed for several protonation states . See S1 Text for more information on the PDLD/S-LRA method . pKa calculations were performed using the PDLD/S-LRA method , as described above , by computing the difference in free energy between the protonated and unprotonated states of each residue . The other residues were kept charged or uncharged as indicated in Table 1 . When a zinc ion was present , we used the position of the zinc ion in the X-ray template of the structural models of ZnT2 ( PDBID: 3H90 ) . To assess the relative free energy of each protonation state , we computed the total electrostatic free energy of the cluster , following the formalism presented previously [21 , 27 , 28] . The total energy of each state is given by the sum of: ( i ) the solvation energy of the ionized residues ( representing the energy cost of bringing the ionized residues and the zinc ion from the bulk to the interior of the protein , relative to the system with zero charges ) ; ( ii ) the energy of ionization of the given residues ( His or Asp ) in water , based on bulk pKa values; ( iii ) the electrostatic interaction between the ionized residues ( the Coulombic energy of bringing the ionized residues in the bulk from an infinite distance to their distance in the binding site , using a dielectric constant of 80 ) ; and ( iv ) the electrostatic interactions between the ionized residues and the zinc ion . When a zinc ion was present , we used the position of the zinc ion in the X-ray template of the structural models of ZnT2 ( PDBID: 3H90 ) . See our recent study for the complete dataset [21] and see S1 Text for more details . The zinc ion was simulated using a 5-particle entity arranged as a tetrahedral complex , based on ligand-field theory [29] . See our previous study for the detailed parameterization [21] and see S1 Text for a longer description . The MC simulation system consisted of a simplified transporter where ions discretely move between pre-designated sites . Specifically , the system was composed of: Two bulk pools of protons and zinc ions , barrier sites on both sides of the transporter , and binding sites for protons and zinc at H106 and H223 ( each able to bind one proton , and both able to bind one zinc together ) . Using this discrete binding sites scheme , each site was assigned an energy based on the total free energy and the zinc binding energy ( see Results ) . Particles were randomly chosen and movements were attempted in random directions , applying the Metropolis acceptance criterion [30] . Prior to beginning the production simulations , we submitted long MC simulations using a flat potential to reveal the energetic contribution of the entropy of the system ( e . g . two binding sites for protons compared to only one binding site for zinc ) . The entropic contributions were very small ( <1 kcal/mol ) and were subtracted from the input potential; this process was successfully applied in previous studies [31 , 32] . The simulations were run for 1010 steps , except for the temperatures of 400K and 425K which were run for 2 . 2\u00d71010 steps . It should be noted here that these high temperatures do not reflect a transporter seemingly functioning at such high temperatures , but is rather applied in order to improve the MC convergence ( by effectively scaling the energy landscape ) ; since the system is simplified , no unfolding can occur , and without energy scaling no events occurred during the simulations within a reasonable amount of time ( i . e . weeks ) . The pools of ions were equilibrated ( by transferring particles between them ) to prevent mass-action-like effects , and the number of ions transported between the pools was counted as flux . The source code for this MC simulation system can be found in https://github . com/ralhadeff/computational-biology/tree/master/reduced-transporter-Monte-Carlo . The values described in the results section are the total number of protons or zinc ions ( in absolute numbers ) that have been transported from one side of the membrane to the other , as flux ( note that the direction of flow of zinc ions and protons are opposite ) ; the ratio is the flux of protons divided by the flux zinc ions ( in absolute values ) ; and the efficiency is the number of zinc ions transported divided by the number of conformational changes that occurred throughout a given simulation , multiplied by 2 ( because each transport cycle requires 2 conformational changes , e . g . IF to OF and back to IF ) . The DNA dye Hoechst 33342 and the zinc chelator N , N , N\u2032 , N\u2032-tetrakis ( 2-pyridinylmethyl ) -1 , 2-ethanediamine ( TPEN ) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Israel ( Rehovot , Israel ) . The cell permeant viable fluorescent zinc probe FluoZin3-AM and LysoTracker Red DND-99 were obtained from Thermo Fisher Scientific ( Waltham , MA ) . Zinc sulfate was obtained from Merck ( Rosh-Ha\u2019ayin , Israel ) . Bafilomycin A1 ( BafA1 ) was obtained from Enzo Biochem , Inc . ( Farmingdale , NY ) . ZnT2-YFP and ZnT2-Ruby were generated as described previously [9 , 33] . Lyso-pHluorin was obtained from Addgene ( Plasmid #70113 ) . Results are presented as means/medians \u00b1 S . D . Statistical comparisons were performed using Student\u2019s t-test ( Prism Graph Pad , Berkeley , CA ) , and a significant difference was demonstrated when p<0 . 05 . Results from at least three independent experiments are shown . Human MCF-7 breast-cancer cells were grown and transiently transfected as previously described [9] . FluoZin3-AM , a specific zinc indicator , labeled the zinc-containing vesicles that were detected solely in cells which overexpressed an active ZnT2 transporter . In contrast , cells transfected with an empty Ruby plasmid , showed very low levels of zinc accumulation that reflected the low number of FluoZin3-positive vesicles per cell . For the zinc transport function experiments , 18 hr after transfection , cells were incubated for 1 hr in growth medium containing increasing concentrations of BafA1 ( 0\u20131000 nM ) . Then , 1 \u03bcM FluoZin3-AM was added to the growth medium for 45 min , followed by double cell wash with PBS , trypsinization , and collection for analysis using a BD FACS Aria IIIu flow cytometer . Cells that were analyzed by a Zeiss LSM-710 confocal microscope were kept in BafA1-containing medium during the analysis . At least 3 independent experiments were performed , and at least 10 , 000 cells were analyzed in each experiment . MCF-7 cells tranfected with ZnT2-Ruby or empty Ruby plasmid were incubated in growth medium , growth medium containing 75 \u03bcM ZnSO4 , or growth medium supplemented with 5\u03bcM TPEN for 1 hr . Then , 1 \u03bcM FluoZin3-AM was added for 1 hr , and the cells were analyzed for FluoZin3 fluorescence levels using flow cytometry . The mean FluoZin3 fluorescence levels were calculated only for live cells that expressed ZnT2-Ruby or empty Ruby . MCF-7 cells tranfected with ZnT2-YFP or empty YFP plasmid were incubated in either growth medium , growth medium containing various concentrations of exogenously added ZnSO4 , or growth medium supplemented with 5\u03bcM TPEN for 1 hr . Then , 100 nM LysoTracker Red was added for 1 hr , and the cells were analyzed for LysoTracker-Red fluorescence levels using flow cytometry . The mean LysoTracker Red fluorescence levels were calculated only for live cells that expressed ZnT2-YFP or empty YFP . MCF-7 cells tranfected with ZnT2-Ruby were incubated either in growth medium , growth medium containing 75\u03bcM ZnSO4 , or growth medium supplented with 5\u03bcM TPEN for 2 hr . Then , the cells were analyzed for Lyso-pHluorin fluorescence levels using flow cytometry . The mean Lyso-pHluorin fluorescence levels were calculated only for live cells that expressed ZnT2-Ruby . A magnification of \u00d763 under immersion oil was used . Excitation wavelengths were: 405 nm for Hoechst 33342 , 488 nm for FluoZin3 or Lyso-pHluorin , and 543 nm for Ruby-tagged ZnT2 proteins . \n In order to provide experimental evidence that ZnT2 is a proton-driven zinc transporter , we examined whether upon alkalization of the vesicular pH , the ability of ZnT2 to accumulate zinc in these vesicles will decrease . We therefore used Bafilomycin A1 ( BafA1 ) , which abolishes vesicular acidification via potent inhibition of V-ATPase . We first determined at which BafA1 concentration one can obtain a significant vesicular alkalization . Towards this end , we used two distinct fluorescent pH sensors: ( i ) LysoTracker Red DND-99 , which fluorescently labels acidic vesicles in live cells including lysosomes; and ( ii ) Lyso-pHluorin construct , which was transfected into human MCF-7 cells . Lyso-pHluorin is a variant of GFP that is targeted to lysosomes via a lysosomal membrane protein fused to a fluorescent tag localized in the lysosome lumen; hence , its fluorescence is markedly enhanced upon alkalization [43] . MCF-7 cells were transiently transfected with Lyso-pHluorin and 18 hr after transfection , the cells were collected and incubated in a growth medium containing increasing concentrations of BafA1 . The cells were also incubated with LysoTracker Red and the cellular fluorescence levels of these two distinct dyes were determined using flow cytometry . Upon incubation with increasing BafA1 concentrations , the lysosomes as well as other V-ATPase-containing acidic vesicles , became increasingly less acidic as indicated by the BafA1 dose-dependent decrease in LysoTracker Red fluorescence ( Fig 5A ) and increase in Lyso-pHluorin fluorescence ( Fig 5B ) . These results confirm that acidic vesicles including lysosomes , become alkaline upon treatment with BafA1 . ZnT2 was previously shown [9 , 21 , 44] to mediate the accumulation of zinc in intracellular vesicles in MCF-7 cells as indicated by the specific zinc probe FluoZin3 ( Fig 6A ) . Furthermore , ZnT2 was previously shown to play a role in lysosomal zinc accumulation in both mouse mammary gland cells and in human HeLa cells [15 , 45 , 46] . We therefore determined the fraction of ZnT2 vesicles that co-localize with Lyso-pHluorin , indicating lysosomal localization of ZnT2 in MCF-7 cells using Imaris software for the confocal microscopy pictures . We found that 36\u00b115% of ZnT2-containing vesicles co-localized with Lyso-pHluorin ( S5 Fig ) . In order to assess whether vesicular zinc accumulation was proton-dependent , we treated MCF-7 cells with BafA1 , which was shown above to markedly alkalize vesicular pH ( Fig 5 ) , and then determined FluoZin3 fluorescence levels . FluoZin3 fluorescence levels were significantly decreased ( compared to untreated control cells ) after treatment with BafA1 concentrations as low as 2 . 5\u20135 nM ( Fig 6A and 6B ) . In addition , using an In-cell analyzer , we found that the average number of FluoZin3-containing vesicles did not increase upon the addition of 75 \u03bcM ZnSO4 to the growth medium; however , upon treatment with concentrations \u2265 2 . 5 nM BafA1 , the average number of FluoZin3-containing vesicles significantly decreased when compared to cells that remained in growth medium ( Fig 6C ) . Interestingly , BafA1 concentrations > 5 nM neither further decreased FluoZin3 fluorescence levels , nor the number of vesicles ( Fig 6B and 6C ) , indicating that these low concentrations of BafA1 are sufficient to alkalize vesicular pH ( Fig 5 ) , thereby disrupting ZnT2-dependent vesicular zinc accumulation . As mentioned above , overexpression of ZnT2 in MCF-7 cells results in high vesicular zinc accumulation . In order to assess the impact of increased extracellular zinc on intravesicular zinc accumulation , we determined FluoZin3 fluorescence levels using flow cytometry upon transient overexpression of Ruby-tagged ZnT2 . We found that upon overexpression of ZnT2 , cellular fluorescence levels of FluoZin3 were 7 . 5-fold higher than cells treated with TPEN , a specific zinc chelator; upon addition of 75 \u03bcM ZnSO4 into the growth medium , FluoZin3 fluorescence levels were 3 . 5-fold higher relative to cells that were grown in regular growth medium containing ~2 \u03bcM zinc ( Fig 7A ) . We next examined whether upon overexpression of ZnT2 in intracellular vesicles , with the addition of extracellular zinc , one can obtain vesicular alkalization , which can indicate a ZnT2-dependent proton export from the vesicles . Indeed , upon transient overexpression of ZnT2-YFP and increasing exogenous concentrations of ZnSO4 , we observed a dose-dependent decrease in LysoTracker Red fluorescence , as determined by flow cytometry , which was significantly different from cells that were not exposed to additional exogenous zinc ( Fig 7B ) . In contrast , cells transfected with an empty vector YFP , maintained the same LysoTracker Red fluorescence at the different zinc concentrations . Moreover , this decrease in LysoTracker Red fluorescence upon addition of 75 \u03bcM ZnSO4 was reversed when cells were treated with TPEN , a zinc chelator ( Fig 7C ) . These results show that upon transient overexpression of ZnT2 , the massive transport of zinc mediated by ZnT2 into intracellular vesicles , leads to a marked alkalization of the vesicular pH , and this effect is abolished upon zinc chelation by TPEN ( Fig 7C ) . Furthermore , co-transfection of MCF-7 cells with Lyso-pHluorin and ZnT2-Ruby , showed a similar pattern; ZnT2 overexpressing cells exhibited high fluorescence levels of Lyso-pHluorin upon addition of 75 \u03bcM ZnSO4 and a markedly reduced fluorescence upon treatment with TPEN ( Fig 7D ) . \n In the present study we showed that upon incubation of cells transiently transfected with ZnT2 in zinc-containing medium , a marked vesicular zinc accumulation occurs , which in turn provokes an alkalization of these initially acidic vesicles . Consistently , disruption of the acidic pH of these vesicles by pharmacological inhibition of V-ATPase , abolished vesicular zinc accumulation . Furthermore , based on our computational energy calculations , we propose that ZnT2 functions as a vesicular proton-coupled zinc transporter with a stoichiometry of 2H+/Zn2+ . Hence , these findings suggest that ZnT2 localized in acidic vesicles , mediates the active translocation of zinc from the cytosol into acidic vesicles , coupled to the movement of two protons in the opposite direction . This proposed mechanism of proton-coupled substrate transport into acidic vesicles is well-established for various transporters of the SLC superfamily , mediating the proton-dependent transport of an assortment of key physiological substrates . Specifically , vesicular transporters of the SLC18 family , comply with this mode of proton-coupled substrate antiport; for example , vesicular storage of monoamines including serotonin , dopamine , histamine , adrenaline and noradrenaline is mediated by the vesicular monoamine transporters ( VMATs ) 1 and 2 [47 , 48] . Hence , VMAT1 ( SLC18A1 ) and VMAT2 ( SLC18A2 ) mediate the packaging of these monoamines from the cytoplasm of neurons in presynaptic vesicles , a process involving the obligatory exchange of two protons ( i . e . movement of protons from the acidic vesicles to the cytosol ) per monoamine substrate . However , it should be noted that in contrast to the chemically inert zinc ion , it is essential that dopamine and noradrenaline are stored within acidic vesicles where they cannot be autoxidized . Specifically , unlike other biogenic amines important in the central nervous system , dopamine and noradrenaline are capable of undergoing a non-enzymatic autoxidative reaction giving rise to a superoxide anion that further decomposes to reactive oxygen species [49] . This autoxidative reaction was suggested to affect the incidence of Parkinson disease [49 , 50] . The vesicular acetylcholine transporter ( VAchT/SLC18A3 ) is also a proton-coupled antiporter which mediates the concentration of acetylcholine within acidic vesicles in cholinergic presynaptic neurons , while consistently moving two protons to the cytoplasm per acetylcholine molecule transported [48] . Similarly , the vesicular inhibitory amino acid transporter ( VIAAT ) or vesicular GABA transporter ( VGAT ) aka SLC32A , is also a vesicular proton-coupled antiporter of glycine and gamma-amino butyric acid ( GABA ) ; VIAAT exchanges GABA or glycine for protons with a presumed 1:1 stoichiometry , although this suggested stoichiometry remains completely unsettled [48 , 51] . VIAAT is present on synaptic vesicles of inhibitory GABAergic and glycinergic neurons . In contrast , certain vesicular/endosomal transporters function in a proton-coupled cotransport mechanism; for example , as almost all iron in the circulation is bound to transferrin under physiological conditions , cellular uptake of iron predominantly proceeds via transferrin receptor-mediated endocytosis [52] . Following reduction by endosomal ferrireductases and release from transferrin , iron is exported from the acidic endosomal compartment to the cytosol in a proton-coupled transport mediated by the divalent metal transporter DMT1 ( DMT1/Nramp2/SLC11A2 ) [53] . In enterocytes , DMT1 , located at the apical side of the enterocyte epithelium , functions as a proton-iron cotransporter mediating the intestinal uptake of iron [53] . Whereas , in all other cells , DMT1 is found in intracellular membranes ( i . e . endosomes ) , where it mediates the exit of endocytosed iron from endosomes into the cytoplasm in a proton-dependent manner [54 , 55] . Similarly , following the folate receptor-mediated endocytosis of reduced folates , the proton-coupled folate transporter ( PCFT/SLC46A1 ) cotransports folates from acidic endolysosomes into the cytosol in a proton-dependent manner [56 , 57] . Hence , key physiological molecules such as neurotransmitters , vitamins and micronutrients may be transported into vesicles or exported out of acidic vesicles , in a proton-dependent manner in either a proton-coupled antiport or cotransport mechanism . Based on concentrative capacity calculations similar to the ones previously shown for VMAT1 , 2 [51] , a pH difference of ~1 . 5 units between the acidic vesicular lumen and the neutral cytoplasm would drive a ~100-fold concentrative ability for ZnT2; it should be noted that a divalent ion such as zinc requires the energy of two protons to achieve the same concentrative capacity as a monovalent ion would , when driven by only one proton . In this respect , our present study suggests that ZnT2 is an electroneutral antiporter exchanging two protons for zinc , a divalent metal cation , and thus any existing membrane voltage would not affect ZnT2\u2019s concentrative capacity . Supporting our finding that ZnT2 is electroneutral , one should consider that extruding a single proton for the intravesicular import of a divalent cation would generate an unfavorable electrogenic transport , especially as the resting membrane potential of acidic vesicles is +20 to +40mV in the luminal side [51] . We find here that upon ectopic overexpression of ZnT2 and consequent vesicular zinc concentration , a marked vesicular alkalization occurred . This finding highlights the fact that during lactation in which ZnT2 expression is markedly induced , an intricate balance between the overexpression of vesicular ZnT2 and V-ATPase must be maintained in order to ensure that the acidic pH is maintained by V-ATPase as otherwise , alkalization will result in loss of the proton-motive force and consequent disruption of multiple vesicular secretory functions . In support of this hypothesis is a recent paper by Lee et al . , [58] which showed that during lactation in a mouse model , the protein levels of V-ATPase are markedly elevated in mammary gland epithelial cells . This of course highlights the obligatory balance between overexpressed ZnT2 ( as well as other transporters ) which translocates protons to the cytoplasm during vesicular accumulation of zinc ( and other physiological substrates ) and proper V-ATPase levels . Therefore , it is not surprising that Lee et al . , [58] discovered that ZnT2 directly interacts with V-ATPase; they further found that deletion of ZnT2 impaired vesicle acidification , biogenesis , trafficking , and secretory function . These novel findings underscore the intricate regulation of the balanced overexpression of vesicular transporters like ZnT2 and an accompanying proper elevation of V-ATPase levels to retain the crucial acidic pH of these secretory vesicles . We herein sought to address the question of which ion provides the driving force for ZnT2 to actively pump zinc ions across the vesicular membrane . A priori , protons appear very likely to drive ZnT2-dependent zinc transport considering the high number of ionizable residues at the putative zinc-binding site , namely , 2 His and 2 Asp residues for ZnT2 [21] . Thus , in the current study we addressed the following key questions: do protons drive ZnT2-mediated zinc transport; if so , which specific residues bind the proton ( s ) ; and how many protons are being exchanged for each zinc ion translocated . Using free-energy calculations , we determined the pKa values of key residues , the relative free energy of the different protonation-state configurations of the zinc binding site residues and the corresponding binding energy of zinc . We reached the conclusions that H106 and H223 serve as proton-binding residues , and that ZnT2 functions as a H+/Zn2+ antiporter with an apparent stoichiometry of 2:1 . In this context , one should consider the challenges involved in modeling some of these aspects . Specifically , reliable calculations of pKa values , especially for functional residues that are not readily available to the bulk , has long been a difficult task [59] . Additionally , the calculation of binding energies of ions with a high charge is very challenging due to the high solvation energy ( -467 kcal/mol in the case of Zn2+ ) [60]; this high solvation energy needs to be compensated by interactions with the protein\u2019s residues , however , these energy calculations could face convergence issues . To this end , our experience shows that using the semi-microscopic PDLD/S-LRA method ( see Methods and SI ) is very effective at overcoming these convergence issues . We present a model for the mechanism of transport and verify it using MC simulations ( Figs 3 and 4 ) ; our MC model is assessed for its robustness by modifying several parameters ( S1\u2013S4 Figs ) and finally validated experimentally in live cells . Using fluorescent techniques , we showed that under alkalization of the vesicular pH , the zinc transport function of ZnT2 was disrupted , leading to the conclusion that ZnT2 functions as a proton-driven antiporter ( see Fig 8 for a summarizing scheme; it should be noted that in this figure we manually adjusted the energies to account for the effective zinc concentration , explained above , for visual purposes ) . ZnT2 functions as an obligatory dimer [33] , but at this point we did not incorporate this information into our model . However , one can conceive several possibilities for how the dimers exhibit transport with the most reasonable ones being coupled dimers ( i . e . both monomers undergo concerted conformational changes ) or decoupled dimers ( i . e . each monomer functions independently ) . The former is likely to increase the efficiency of the transport , provided that ZnT2 harbors a higher barrier for the conformational change if the cluster charge is non-zero ( see above ) , because each monomer not only depends on its own charge but also on the total charge of the counterpart monomer , thus effectively increasing the penalty to undergo conformational changes that are not efficient . The underlying assumption here is that the \u2018proper\u2019 state of the system is the lowest in energy , which is true for our case , as shown in Fig 2 . Another point that we wish to bring forward is the potential existence of ligand-induced conformational selection driving ZnT2 transport cycle ( e . g . similar in principle to vSGLT [61] ) . Whereas our MC simulations show that this is not strictly necessary ( Fig 4 ) , a model where the different ions drive the conformational change in the \u2018correct\u2019 direction would prove beneficial in terms of the rate of the reaction . In other words , if ZnT2 were to selectively prefer the cytoplasm-facing conformation , when it is bound to protons , and the lumen-facing conformation , when it binds a zinc ion , this would direct the conformation towards the fastest exchange rate , since as soon as the ion would bind on one direction , the equilibrium would shift , driving the exchange reaction forward , and so forth . Now , although we do not have direct observations for this ( i . e . the difference in energy between the conformations has not been determined ) , it is encouraging to see that zinc binding is stronger in the lumen-facing conformation , which would suggest zinc shifts the equilibrium to some extent in that direction . Similarly , the pKa values for the His residues are on average lower in the cytoplasmic-facing conformation ( Table 1 ) , suggesting that protonation of the His residues should shift the equilibrium to the cytoplasm-facing conformation . Thus , the binding energies should in principle promote a behavior of \u2018seesaw-like\u2019 directional conformational changes . In summary , using computational analysis we propose that ZnT2 functions as a vesicular proton-coupled zinc transporter with an apparent stoichiometry of 2H+/Zn2+ , and provide experimental evidence for the proton-driven zinc transport of ZnT2 . Our experimental and computational findings shed light on the molecular transport mechanism of ZnT2 and expand our knowledge regarding other zinc transporters .", "headings": ["Abstract", "Introduction", "Materials and methods", "Results", "Discussion"], "keywords": ["protons", "vesicles", "zinc transporters", "biological transport", "cellular structures and organelles", "thermodynamics", "proteins", "zinc", "chemistry", "nucleons", "antiport proteins", "free energy", "cytoplasm", "physics", "stoichiometry", "biochemistry", "cell biology", "nuclear physics", "biology and life sciences", "physical sciences", "metabolism", "chemical elements"], "id": "journal.pcbi.1006882"}
{"lay_summary": "Stalling and collapse of DNA replication forks is an important source of genome instability and has been implicated in early steps of carcinogenesis . The maintenance of stable intermediates upon stalled replication requires the coordinated action of a number of proteins and proper inhibitory control of dangerous enzymatic activities . In this study , we uncover an evolutionarily conserved mechanism through which 14-3-3 proteins modulate the checkpoint-mediated phosphorylation of , and in turn limit the activity of , an exonuclease ( Exo1 ) previously implicated in pathological processing of stalled replication forks and other sensitive DNA intermediates . This represents an unprecedented link in the field of DNA repair and genome stability , providing a molecular rationale to the yet undefined role of 14-3-3 proteins in the maintenance of genome integrity after replication stress . In analogy to Exo1 , our data suggest that additional factors at replication forks may be subjected to similar regulation , pointing to the 14-3-3 proteins as central components of the checkpoint triggered in response to replication stress .", "article": "Replication fork integrity , which is essential for the maintenance of genome stability , is monitored by checkpoint-mediated phosphorylation events . 14-3-3 proteins are able to bind phosphorylated proteins and were shown to play an undefined role under DNA replication stress . Exonuclease 1 ( Exo1 ) processes stalled replication forks in checkpoint-defective yeast cells . We now identify 14-3-3 proteins as in vivo interaction partners of Exo1 , both in yeast and mammalian cells . Yeast 14-3-3\u2013deficient cells fail to induce Mec1\u2013dependent Exo1 hyperphosphorylation and accumulate Exo1\u2013dependent ssDNA gaps at stalled forks , as revealed by electron microscopy . This leads to persistent checkpoint activation and exacerbated recovery defects . Moreover , using DNA bi-dimensional electrophoresis , we show that 14-3-3 proteins promote fork progression under limiting nucleotide concentrations . We propose that 14-3-3 proteins assist in controlling the phosphorylation status of Exo1 and additional unknown targets , promoting fork progression , stability , and restart in response to DNA replication stress . \n DNA lesions can cause stalling and collapse of the replication fork and lead to chromosome breaks , mutations , genome rearrangements and eventually cancer [1] . To prevent this , a replication checkpoint has evolved as surveillance mechanism to control components of the replisome [2] and to allow coordinating replication with cell cycle progression and DNA repair . Maintenance of stable replication intermediates when DNA synthesis is impeded , requires replisome stability and checkpoint-dependent phosphorylation [3] . Although crucial targets for this checkpoint function await identification , nuclease activities are particularly likely to require fine-tuning , to avoid unscheduled DNA processing under DNA replication stress [4] . Exo1 is a Rad2 family DNA repair nuclease able to remove mononucleotides from the 5\u2032 end of the DNA duplex [5] that was originally identified in the Schizosaccharomyces pombe [6] and subsequently in humans [7] . Exo1 is implicated in several DNA repair pathways including mismatch repair , post replication repair , meiotic and mitotic recombination and double strand break repair [8]\u2013[12] . Saccharomyces cerevisiae Exo1 acts redundantly with Rad27 in processing Okazaki fragments during DNA replication [13] . More recently , Exo1 was shown to be recruited to stalled replication forks where it counteracts fork reversal [4] . Human EXO1 activity is controlled by post-translational modifications , with ATR-dependent phosphorylation targeting it to ubiquitin-mediated degradation upon replication fork stalling [14] , [15] , and ATM-dependent phosphorylation apparently restraining its activity during homologous recombination [16] . Analogously , Mec1-dependent phosphorylation inhibits yeast Exo1 activity at uncapped telomeres [17] . Studies in budding yeast showed that EXO1 deletion suppresses the sensitivity of rad53 , but not mec1 , mutant cells to agents causing reversible or irreversible stalling of replication forks [18] . Taken together , this evidence indicates that Exo1 activity is tightly controlled under DNA replication stress and DNA damage . Eukaryotic 14-3-3 are highly conserved proteins that establish phosphorylation-dependent interactions and modulate the functions of proteins involved in processes such as metabolism , protein trafficking , signal transduction , apoptosis and cell-cycle [19] . Seven 14-3-3 isoforms exist in mammalian cells , but only two in yeast . Structural analysis showed that 14-3-3 proteins self-assemble into flexible homo- and hetero-dimers forming a central groove that is able to adapt two extended peptides [20] , [21] . This feature confers them the ability to act as adaptors that integrate signals from different pathways [22] , [23] . 14-3-3 proteins can also bind cruciform DNA [24] and replication initiation proteins such as Mcm2 and Orc2 [25] . Upon DNA damage and DNA replication stress , 14-3-3 proteins are required for cell cycle restart , suppression of genomic instability and viability [26] . Moreover , 14-3-3 proteins genetically and physically interact with the checkpoint protein Rad53 [27] as well as the acetyltransferases and deacetylases Esa1 and Rpd3 upon replication perturbations [28] . Although these data point to an important role of 14-3-3 during replication stress , the exact mechanism of 14-3-3 action remains unknown . In this study , we identify 14-3-3 as novel interaction partners of Exo1 and demonstrate that they regulate phosphorylation of the nuclease . We provide evidence for an accumulation of Exo1-dependent ssDNA gaps at stalled forks in yeast 14-3-3 deficient cells and we show that this causes persistent checkpoint activation and recovery defects . We also show that 14-3-3 proteins control progression and stability of replication forks under conditions of limiting nucleotide availability . Taken together , our data demonstrate that 14-3-3 have a crucial role in regulating the function of proteins at stalled forks , among which Exo1 is a key target . \n To identify novel interaction partners for human EXO1 we designed a yeast two-hybrid screen with GAL4-bait fusion proteins that contain either full-length EXO1 or \u0394N-EXO1 ( EXO1366\u2013846 ) , which lacks the entire catalytic domain . Since the former was not expressed ( data not shown ) , we used the latter to screen a blood peripheral cDNA library . Three 14-3-3 proteins were the highest hits ( Table S1 ) , with the \u03b2- being more represented than the \u03b5- and \u03b6-isoform . The presence of an established EXO1 binding protein among the hits , MLH1 ( Table S1 ) , confirmed the reliability of this screen . To independently verify these data , we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments . Given the low abundance of EXO1 in the cell [14] , we transiently transfected HEK-293 cells with an Omni-tagged EXO1 construct [14] and immunoprecipitated the expressed protein using a pan-14-3-3 antibody . The data showed that Omni-EXO1 and 14-3-3 proteins could be recovered as a complex ( Figure 1A ) . To assess the physiological significance of the EXO1/14-3-3 interaction we selected Sacc . cerevisiae , a system where only two 14-3-3 proteins are present , namely Bmh1 and Bmh2 . In preliminary experiments we examined whether yeast Exo1 and 14-3-3 proteins interact . A C-terminal Myc- or a HA-tag was added to the endogenous EXO1 or BMH1/BMH2 genes , respectively . Immunoprecipitation experiments showed that Exo1 formed complexes with Bmh1 or Bmh2 in a HU-dependent manner ( Figure 1B ) . We next explored a possible direct Bmh/Exo1 interaction by Far Western blot analysis . Exo1-Myc immunoprecipitated from control or HU-treated cells was resolved by SDS-PAGE and denatured/renatured on PVDF . Probing the membrane with purified GST-Bmh1 revealed that a direct interaction with Exo1 occurred both in the case of untreated and HU-treated cells ( Figure S1 ) . These data possibly indicate that an Exo1 domain normally hidden in non-treated cells may become available for interaction with 14-3-3 proteins upon HU-treatment . Such domain may be artificially exposed during Far Western analysis due to incomplete renaturation of Exo1 . Taken together , these data suggest that the EXO1/14-3-3 interaction is conserved from yeast to mammalian cells . While the interaction is HU-independent in mammalian cells , it requires HU in yeast . This may reflect the different modes of EXO1 regulation in the two systems [15] , [17] . Genetic and flow cytometric analysis evidenced the sensitivity of 14-3-3-deficient cells to DNA replication stress , with distinct bmh1 ( bmh2\u0394 ) alleles showing different defects upon nucleotide depletion ( HU ) or treatment with DNA damaging agents ( UV or methylmethansulfonate , MMS ) [26] . However , despite the evidence that 14-3-3 proteins bind origins of replication and cruciform DNA [29] , suggesting a regulatory role in DNA replication [25] , the issue of possible direct involvement of 14-3-3 in fork stability or processing under genotoxic stress conditions remained to be clarified . Given the comprehensive molecular characterization of yeast Exo1 as component of the replisome and of its role , in checkpoint defective cells , in the processing of forks stalled by nucleotide depletion [4] , we focused our investigations on the bmh1-280 bmh2\u0394 double mutant ( bmh1bmh2 hereafter ) . This mutant shows normal cell cycle progression in unperturbed conditions , but selective sensitivity and cell cycle recovery defects in response to HU [26] . The mutant Bmh1-280 protein carries a single point mutation ( E136>G ) in helix \u03b1E at a residue neighboring amino acids that form salt bridges and hydrogen bonds with the ligand [21] . Interestingly , immunoprecipitation experiments showed that the mutant Bmh1-280 protein did not interact with Exo1 in untreated nor HU-treated cells ( Figure 1C ) . Thus , we asked whether the cell cycle recovery defects of this mutant reflect a direct role of 14-3-3 proteins at replication forks and whether Exo1 is also implicated in these processes . We performed neutral-neutral bidimensional gel electrophoresis ( 2D gel ) on the early origin of replication ARS305 , which is known to be activated in HU-treated cells [3] . Although the 2D gel pattern looked normal in HU-treated bmh1bmh2 cells , we observed that replication intermediates ( RIs ) in 14-3-3 defective cells were still present close to the origin 60 min after HU removal and were only restarted at 90\u2013120 min ( Figure 2A and data not shown ) . This suggests that misregulation of the replisome , without dramatic physical processing of the forks , might be sufficient to impair fork restart . This effect was not detectably suppressed by EXO1 deletion ( Figure 2A ) . Flow cytometric analysis of HU-released cells confirmed the slow recovery of the bmh1bmh2 strain and showed that lack of Exo1 per se did not alter the pattern of cell cycle progression ( Figure 2B ) . On the other hand , EXO1 deletion in a bmh1bmh2 background led to a partial rescue of the recovery defect , particularly evident at late time points ( \u2265120 min ) after release from HU ( Figure 2B ) . This evidence prompted us to ask whether EXO1 deletion in this background may affect Rad53 activity . Western blot analysis with total and phosphospecific Rad53 antibodies [30] showed that , compared to wild type cells , Rad53 was hyperphosphorylated in HU-treated bmh1bmh2 cells and that its dephosphorylation was retarded during the HU-recovery phase ( Figure 2C and 2D ) , thus correlating with the described replication restart defect . Importantly , deletion of EXO1 in 14-3-3-deficient cells re-established to a great extent the pattern of rapid Rad53 dephosphorylation in the recovery phase ( Figure 2C and 2D ) , substantiating the flow cytometry data ( Figure 2B ) . Overall these data suggest that 14-3-3 proteins are directly implicated in the effective restart of stalled DNA replication forks . Alternatively , they may assist rapid Rad53 dephosphorylation , which is in turn required for fork restart upon HU removal [31] . The latter interpretation is however unlikely as EXO1 deletion , which markedly restores Rad53 dephosphorylation upon HU removal , does not detectably improve the defective fork restart observed in 14-3-3 deficient cells on the ARS305 replicon . Thus , in the 14-3-3 defective background , Exo1 activity does not directly impact the rate of fork restart , but slows down checkpoint inactivation and delays cell cycle resumption . Exo1 is controlled in a phosphorylation-dependent manner upon replication fork stalling in mammalian cells [14] and upon a variety of genotoxic insults in yeast [17] . We obtained evidence that yeast Exo1 is phosphorylated in a Mec1-dependent manner also in response to HU ( Figure 3A ) . Notably , the improved resolution of Exo1 phospho-forms by Phos-tag SDS-PAGE [32] allowed us visualizing the complete pattern of Exo1 phosphorylation in response to replicative stress ( Figure 3A and 3B ) . Next , we asked whether 14-3-3 proteins might be involved in the regulation of Exo1 phosphorylation and stability . Western blot analysis showed that in 14-3-3-deficient cells total Exo1 levels were unchanged ( Figure S2 ) , but Exo1 was not phosphorylated to the same stoichiometry observed in wild type cells ( Figure 3B , 90 min ) . Moreover , the rate of Exo1 dephosphorylation upon recovery from HU was considerably reduced in mutant cells , with Exo1 being completely dephosphorylated in wild type but not in 14-3-3-deficient cells ( Figure 3B , 120 min ) . Defective Exo1 phosphorylation in HU-treated 14-3-3-deficient cells is not an indirect consequence of defective checkpoint activation , as under these conditions Rad53 , another Mec1-dependent checkpoint target , is promptly phosphorylated ( Figure 2C and 2D ) . Since phosphorylation restrains yeast Exo1 activity [17] , we propose that 14-3-3 proteins play an important role in the dynamic control of Exo1 activity upon DNA replication stress and may act as platform for the control of Exo1 phosphorylation . In this respect , attempts to assess the phosphorylation status of Bmh-bound Exo1 were unfortunately inconclusive , as - differently from TCA extracts ( Figure 3 ) - the extracts used for immunoprecipitation fail to be resolved in discrete bands by Phos-tag SDS-PAGE ( data not shown ) . Given that 14-3-3 proteins bind ligands in phospho-dependent and -independent manner [21] , it will be important to overcome these technical limitations to address the role of 14-3-3 proteins in controlling the phosphorylation of Exo1 and , possibly , additional targets in the DNA damage response ( see below ) . As Exo1 activity and Rad53 phosphorylation have been linked to the processing of stalled DNA replication forks , we decided to assess whether defective Rad53 and Exo1 phosphorylation in 14-3-3-deficient cells could reflect changes in the fine architecture of stalled forks . To answer this question , we synchronized the cells in G1 , released them for 1 h in YPD medium containing 0 . 2 M HU and examined RIs by electron microscopy ( EM ) under non-denaturing conditions [33] . For each strain , about 100 RIs were analyzed in duplicate . 14-3-3-deficient cells showed a dramatic accumulation of ssDNA gaps behind the replication fork ( Figure 4A ) . Statistical analysis indicated that approximately 50% of all RIs analyzed contained one or more ssDNA gaps ( Figure 4B ) . Interestingly , deletion of EXO1 in the bmh1bmh2 background completely suppressed this phenotype , leading to a reduction of the ssDNA gaps behind the fork to a level similar to wild type or exo1\u0394 cells ( Figure 4B ) . The comparison of ssDNA gaps length scored by EM evidenced a striking difference: whereas bmh1bmh2 cells displayed a significant number of large size gaps ( >0 . 5 Kb ) , the latter were absent in bmh1bmh2exo1\u0394 cells ( Figure 4C ) . The resolution limit of 50\u201370 nucleotides may have impaired detection of nicks/small gaps in this as well as in previous EM studies with HU [34] . Such structures , however , become visible in 14-3-3-deficient cells , where the unleashed Exo1 activity would enlarge gaps above the detection limit . These data suggest that 14-3-3 proteins are required to prevent unscheduled Exo1 activity behind stalled replication forks in a checkpoint-proficient background . The implications of these observations are of great significance . A loose control of Exo1 activity may render DNA synthesis more discontinuous in conditions of replicative stress , either promoting additional uncoupling/repriming events or enlarging existing ssDNA gaps via 5\u2032-3\u2032 exonucleolytic processing . Although additional work is required to directly address this point , it is conceivable that continuous polymerase stall due to insufficient deoxynucleotide levels might per se lead to increased repriming events , thus raising the number of 5\u2032-ends available for processing by Exo1 . In this setting , a strict control of Exo1 activity would be needed to limit damage . We observed no bias for the presence of gaps in leading vs . lagging strands - whenever these could be identified [35] - and we could occasionally detect gaps on opposite strands within the same molecule ( Figure S3 ) , suggesting that unscheduled Exo1 activity in 14-3-3 defective cells is not restricted to leading or lagging strand . Replication recovery defects have been previously described and usually reflect replication fork collapse detectable by 2D gel analysis [3] . On the contrary , stalled replication forks in 14-3-3 deficient cells , albeit unable to restart DNA synthesis and abnormally processed by Exo1 activity , upon prolonged HU treatment show a 2D gel pattern indistinguishable from that of wild type cells . We thus decided to investigate in more detail the structure and progression of these forks , performing 2D gel analysis at different time points after HU addition . To this end , cells synchronized in G1 by \u03b1-factor were released into medium containing HU and RIs were examined by 2D gels . Figure 5B shows the probes designed to visualize replication fork progression in a region of Chromosome III that contains , besides the early active origin ARS305 [36] , a contiguous passively replicated region ( Part A ) and a region including the dormant origin ARS301 ( Part D ) [3] . As compared to wild type , bmh1bmh2 cells showed the same kinetics of origin firing , albeit with slightly lower efficiency as revealed by the intensity of the bubble arc at 30 min ( Figure 5C ) . Progression of the forks in HU from ARS305 across the region of Part A ( \u223c5 Kb to the left of ARS305 ) was completed after 2\u20133 h in wild type cells , with the peak of intermediates detectable after \u223c1 h . In bmh1bmh2 cells the first intermediates appeared on this region with 30 min delay , whereas the peak of intermediates was delayed of \u223c2 h as compared to wild type cells ( Figure 5C ) , indicative of a significant decrease in the rate of the replication fork progression in HU . Slow RIs disappearance from the origin and delayed invasion of adjacent chromosomal regions may in principle result also from asynchronous firing of ARS305 during the HU arrest . However we consider this alternative interpretation unlikely for the following reasons: a ) by budding experiments , 14-3-3 defective cells do not display asynchronous entrance in S-phase ( data not shown ) ; b ) the comparable intensity of the Y arc on fragment A in the wt ( 60 min ) and in the 14-3-3 mutant ( 180 min ) suggests that forks progress synchronously but slower from the early origin ARS305; c ) accordingly , the progressive accumulation of the Y signal on fragment A in 14-3-3 defective cells strictly correlates with the disappearance of the bubble ark on the ARS305 fragment , further suggesting slow but synchronous progression of replication forks on the ARS305 replicon . It was previously shown that yeast 14-3-3 proteins bind to the checkpoint kinase Rad53 and directly influence its DNA damage-dependent functions [27] . Therefore , we asked whether the slow fork progression in bmh1bmh2 cells might be solely due to checkpoint defects . To address this issue , we used checkpoint defective Rad53-mutant cells ( rad53-K227A ) . The latter displayed striking differences when compared to bmh1bmh2 cells . Both the destabilization of RIs ( ARS305 and Part A ) and the uncontrolled firing of dormant origins displayed by rad53-K227A cells ( Part D ) [3] , were absent in bmh1bmh2 cells ( Figure 5C ) . Furthermore , EM did not display any fork reversal or accumulation of ssDNA at replication forks , typical of HU-treated rad53 cells [34] ( data not shown ) . Finally , 2D gel analysis ( Figure S4C , S4F and S4H ) and drop assays ( Figure S5 ) revealed synergistic effects of 14-3-3 and Rad53 on both fork stability and survival . Overall , these data indicate that the phenotype observed in 14-3-3 deficient cells reflects a genuine role of 14-3-3 proteins at replication forks and that 14-3-3 and Rad53 have crucial but distinct roles at HU-challenged forks . Deletion of EXO1 partially rescued the HU-sensitivity of rad53-K227A cells , but not of a bmh1bmh2 strain ( Figure S5 ) . Furthermore , in contrast to checkpoint defective cells , where stability of RIs could be rescued by EXO1 deletion [4] , fork progression defects of bmh1bmh2 cells were not rescued by loss of EXO1 ( Figure S4G ) . Thus , while the processing defect that leads to accumulation of ssDNA gaps in 14-3-3-deficient cells was completely suppressed by EXO1 deletion , this did not reflect in suppression of HU sensitivity nor of defective fork progression in HU-treated 14-3-3 deficient cells . Altogether this evidence suggests that 14-3-3 proteins might regulate additional targets during replication stress , possibly through modulation of their phosphorylation . This is not unexpected , given the role of 14-3-3 as integrators of signaling pathways [19] and considering the multiplicity of 14-3-3 targets [37] , [38] . Our data implicate 14-3-3 proteins as possible central regulator of the checkpoint response . In analogy with previously reported cases [22] and according to structural data on the dynamic nature of 14-3-3 dimers [39] , one may envisage a role for 14-3-3 proteins as docking clamp tethering Exo1 - and other unknown targets - with the kinase controlling its/their activity . Notably , 14-3-3 proteins were reported to bind Rad53 [27] , one of the candidate checkpoint kinases required for Exo1 phosphorylation [17] . In conclusion , this work sheds further light on processes occurring at stalled replication forks , proposing 14-3-3 proteins as central integrators of signals that regulate fork stability and processing . Challenges lying ahead consist in the identification of components of the replisome , or proteins controlling them , that may be 14-3-3 targets , as well as in the elucidation of the exact mechanism by which 14-3-3 modulate Exo1 phosphorylation and activity . \n The antibodies used in this study were: goat polyclonal anti-Omni-probe ( M21 , sc-499 , Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) ; rabbit polyclonal anti-pan 14-3-3 ( SA-483 , Biomol ) ; mouse monoclonal anti-HA ( 12CA5 , Sigma ) and anti-Myc ( 9E10 , Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) ; rabbit polyclonal anti-Rad53 ( a kind gift from C .
