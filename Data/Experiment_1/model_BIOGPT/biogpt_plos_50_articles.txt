gene expression varies widely between individuals of a population, and regulatory change can underlie phenotypes of evolutionary and biomedical relevance. a key question in the field is how dna sequence variants impact gene expression, with most mechanistic studies to date focused on the effects of genetic change on regulatory regions upstream of protein-coding sequence. by contrast, the role of rna 3 ′ -end processing in regulatory variation remains largely unknown, owing in part to the challenge of identifying functional elements in 3 ′ untranslated regions. in this work, we conducted a genomic survey of transcript ends in lymphoblastoid cells from genetically distinct human individuals. our analysis mapped the cis-regulatory architecture of 3 ′ gene ends, finding that transcript end positions did not fall randomly in untranslated regions, but rather preferentially flanked the locations of 3 ′ regulatory elements, including mirna sites. the usage of these transcript length forms and motifs varied across human individuals, and polymorphisms in polyadenylation signals and other 3 ′ motifs were significant predictors of expression levels of the genes in which they lay. independent single-gene experiments confirmed the effects of polyadenylation variants on steady-state expression of their respective genes, and validated the regulatory function of 3 ′ cis-regulatory sequence elements that mediated expression of these distinct rna length forms. focusing on the immune regulator irf5, we established the effect of natural variation in rna 3 ′ -end processing on regulatory response to antigen stimulation. our results underscore the importance of two mechanisms at play in the genetics of 3 ′ -end variation: the usage of distinct 3 ′ -end processing signals and the effects of 3 ′ sequence elements that determine transcript fate. our findings suggest that the strategy of integrating observed 3 ′ -end positions with inferred 3 ′ regulatory motifs will prove to be a critical tool in continued efforts to interpret human genome variation. naturally occurring genetic differences in gene regulation within populations underlie phenotypes of evolutionary and biomedical interest [1] [3] and can serve as the basis for inference of regulatory networks [4], [5]. a key problem in the field is understanding the molecular mechanisms by which dna sequence variants give rise to expression change. recent work has emphasized the importance of sequence differences in regions upstream of gene loci that harbor cis-acting determinants of transcription factor binding [6] [10] and chromatin architecture [11] [13]. much less is known about the role of 3 ′ -end regulation as a determinant of expression variation between individuals. alternative polyadenylation represents a major regulatory strategy in the human genome, with analysis across tissue types detecting multiple 3 ′ utr forms of over half of all human genes [14]. detailed genetic studies have shown that variation in polyadenylation signal usage is associated with differential expression of a subset of human genes, including irf5 [15].
the live attenuated simian immunodeficiency virus (lasiv) vaccine sivδnef is one of the most effective vaccines in inducing protection against wild-type lentiviral challenge, yet little is known about the mechanisms underlying its remarkable protective efficacy. here, we exploit deep sequencing technology and comprehensive cd8 t cell epitope mapping to deconstruct the cd8 t cell response, to identify the regions of immune pressure and viral escape, and to delineate the effect of epitope escape on the evolution of the cd8 t cell response in sivδnef-vaccinated animals. we demonstrate that the initial cd8 t cell response in the acute phase of sivδnef infection is mounted predominantly against more variable epitopes, followed by widespread sequence evolution and viral escape. furthermore, we show that epitope escape expands the cd8 t cell repertoire that targets highly conserved epitopes, defined as anentropic specificity, and generates de novo responses to the escaped epitope variants during the vaccination period. these results correlate sivδnef-induced protection with expanded anentropic specificity and increased response depth. importantly, these findings render sivδnef, long the gold standard in hiv / siv vaccine research, as a proof-of-concept vaccine that highlights the significance of the twin principles of anentropic specificity and repertoire depth in successful vaccine design. two decades ago, a report described a cohort of rhesus macaques infected with the live attenuated simian immunodeficiency virus (lasiv), sivδnef, and subsequently protected from pathogenic wild-type siv challenge [1]. since then, numerous studies have demonstrated the efficacy of sivδnef-induced protection, ranging from complete protection with sterilizing immunity to partial protection with two or more logs reduction in peak and set-point viremia [2 6]. remarkably, presumably in part due to the replication of sivδnef in mucosal sites [7], robust protection has been also been documented following mucosal challenges [3 5]. sivδnef has also induced significant protection against heterologous challenge, albeit less effectively than against homologous challenge [4, 5]. however, studies describing disease progression in sivδnef-vaccinated infant macaques and a subset of adult non-human primates precluded live attenuated hiv from being developed as a vaccine in human subjects [8 10]. due to concerns over safety, research on sivδnef and related lasiv vaccines has shifted from safety-and-efficacy determination to mechanism-of-action delineation. as the most effective lentiviral vaccine, sivδnef has been extensively studied in order to shed light on the correlates of protection and mechanisms of vaccine-induced immunity.
mucosal infections with candida albicans belong to the most frequent forms of fungal diseases. host protection is conferred by cellular immunity; however, the induction of antifungal immunity is not well understood. using a mouse model of oropharyngeal candidiasis (opc) we show that interleukin-1 receptor (il-1r) signaling is critical for fungal control at the onset of infection through its impact on neutrophils at two levels. we demonstrate that both the recruitment of circulating neutrophils to the site of infection and the mobilization of newly generated neutrophils from the bone marrow depended on il-1r. consistently, il-1r-deficient mice displayed impaired chemokine production at the site of infection and defective secretion of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (g-csf) in the circulation in response to c. albicans. strikingly, endothelial cells were identified as the primary cellular source of g-csf during opc, which responded to il-1α that was released from keratinocytes in the infected tissue. the il-1-dependent crosstalk between two different cellular subsets of the nonhematopoietic compartment was confirmed in vitro using a novel murine tongue-derived keratinocyte cell line and an established endothelial cell line. these data establish a new link between il-1 and granulopoiesis in the context of fungal infection. together, we identified two complementary mechanisms coordinating the neutrophil response in the oral mucosa, which is critical for preventing fungal growth and dissemination, and thus protects the host from disease. the opportunistic fungal pathogen candida albicans has emerged as a significant cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, particularly in immunocompromised individuals [1]. of the diverse forms of disease manifestations, mucosal infections with c. albicans are by far most abundant [2]. the symptoms reach from mild forms of infection to chronic or recurrent diseases. no licensed fungal vaccines are currently available to prevent disease, and toxicity and resistance to available drugs compromise the effective management of patients. with the ever-increasing population of immunocompromised patients, c. albicans infections thus represent an important socio-economic challenge worldwide. the epithelium constitutes the first point of contact between the fungus and the host [3]. it provides an important physical barrier to prevent fungal invasion. moreover, it has the capacity to sense and respond to the fungus. by producing inflammatory mediators and antifungal defense molecules the epithelium actively participates in the host response and together with leukocytes, including neutrophils and il-17-producing lymphocytes, contributes to limiting fungal (over) growth. diverse mutual interactions between leukocytes and the epithelium are critical for mounting a broadly protective response against c. albicans. the epithelium elicits signals in response to the fungus that can promote the inflammatory response [3], while the immune system is able to recognize and eliminate the fungus [4].
between 2000 2007, the global programme to eliminate lymphatic filariasis (gpelf) delivered more than 1. 9 billion treatments to nearly 600 million individuals via annual mass drug administration (mda) of anti-filarial drugs (albendazole, ivermectin, diethylcarbamazine) to all at-risk for 4 6 years. quantifying the resulting economic benefits of this significant achievement is important not only to justify the resources invested in the gpelf but also to more fully understand the programme's overall impact on some of the poorest endemic populations. to calculate the economic benefits, the number of clinical manifestations averted was first quantified and the savings associated with this disease prevention then analyzed in the context of direct treatment costs, indirect costs of lost-labor, and costs to the health system to care for affected individuals. multiple data sources were reviewed, including published literature and databases from the world health organization, international monetary fund, and international labour organization an estimated us $21. 8 billion of direct economic benefits will be gained over the lifetime of 31. 4 million individuals treated during the first 8 years of the gpelf. of this total, over us $2. 3 billion is realized by the protection of nearly 3 million newborns and other individuals from acquiring lymphatic filariasis as a result of their being born into areas freed of lf transmission. similarly, more than 28 million individuals already infected with lf benefit from gpelf's halting the progression of their disease, which results in an associated lifetime economic benefit of approximately us $19. 5 billion. in addition to these economic benefits to at-risk individuals, decreased patient services associated with reduced lf morbidity saves the health systems of endemic countries approximately us $2. 2 billion. mda for lf offers significant economic benefits. moreover, with favorable program implementation costs (largely a result of the sustained commitments of donated drugs from the pharmaceutical industry) it is clear that the economic rate of return of the gpelf is extremely high and that this programme continues to prove itself an excellent investment in global health. as a leading cause of permanent and long-term disability worldwide, the parasitic infection lymphatic filariasis (lf) imposes a severe physical and socioeconomic burden on 1. 3 billion at-risk persons in 83 endemic countries. an estimated 120 million people are already infected with lf, with about 40 million suffering from overt clinical disease manifested as painful severe swelling due to lymphedema (generally an accumulation of lymphatic fluid in the limbs) and hydrocele (fluid accumulation in the scrotal sac). to rid the world of this disease, the world bank estimated that the annual cost of treating 1 million lf-infected individuals in endemic countries would be us $1 billion, with an additional us $3 billion in indirect costs to health systems.
homozygous mutations in the glucocerebrosidase (gba) gene result in gaucher disease (gd), the most common lysosomal storage disease. recent genetic studies have revealed that gba mutations confer a strong risk for sporadic parkinson s disease (pd). to investigate how gba mutations cause pd, we generated gba nonsense mutant (gba- / -) medaka that are completely deficient in glucocerebrosidase (gcase) activity. in contrast to the perinatal death in humans and mice lacking gcase activity, gba- / - medaka survived for months, enabling analysis of the pathological progression. gba- / - medaka displayed the pathological phenotypes resembling human neuronopathic gd including infiltration of gaucher cell-like cells into the brains, progressive neuronal loss, and microgliosis. detailed pathological findings represented lysosomal abnormalities in neurons and alpha-synuclein (α-syn) accumulation in axonal swellings containing autophagosomes. unexpectedly, disruption of α-syn did not improve the life span, formation of axonal swellings, neuronal loss, or neuroinflammation in gba- / - medaka. taken together, the present study revealed gba- / - medaka as a novel neuronopathic gd model, the pahological mechanisms of α-syn accumulation caused by gcase deficiency, and the minimal contribution of α-syn to the pathogenesis of neuronopathic gd. gaucher disease (gd) is the most common lysosomal storage disease and is caused by homozygous mutations in glucocerebrosidase (gba). mutations in gba lead to decreased enzymatic activity of glucocerebrosidase (gcase) and result in the accumulation of its substrates, glucocerebroside and glucosylsphingosine [1, 2]. gd is classically divided into three subtypes: a non-neuronopathic form (type 1), an acute neuronopathic form (type 2), and a subacute neuronopathic form (type 3). visceral manifestations of all forms are characterized by hepatosplenomegaly, cytopenia, and skeletal disease. pathologically, the accumulation of lipid-laden macrophages, called gaucher cells, are observed in the affected organs. neurological manifestations of neuronopathic forms include brainstem dysfunction, intellectual disability, seizures, and myoclonic movement. pathological features of neuronopathic forms are neuronal loss, astrogliosis, microgliosis, and perivascular accumulation of gaucher cells [3]. the most severe neuronopathic form, called the perinatal lethal type, has also been reported [4]. common presentations of patients with the perinatal lethal type are hydrops fetalis and congenital ichthyosis. almost all patients die within the first year of life [5].
listeria monocytogenes is a facultative intracellular pathogen capable of inducing a robust cell-mediated immune response to sub-lethal infection. the capacity of l. monocytogenes to escape from the phagosome and enter the host cell cytosol is paramount for the induction of long-lived cd8 t cell mediated protective immunity. here, we show that the impaired t cell response to l. monocytogenes confined within a phagosome is not merely a consequence of inefficient antigen presentation, but is the result of direct suppression of the adaptive response. this suppression limited not only the adaptive response to vacuole-confined l. monocytogenes, but negated the response to bacteria within the cytosol. co-infection with phagosome-confined and cytosolic l. monocytogenes prevented the generation of acquired immunity and limited expansion of antigen-specific t cells relative to the cytosolic l. monocytogenes strain alone. bacteria confined to a phagosome suppressed the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and led to the rapid myd88-dependent production of il-10. blockade of the il-10 receptor or the absence of myd88 during primary infection restored protective immunity. our studies demonstrate that the presence of microbes within a phagosome can directly impact the innate and adaptive immune response by antagonizing the signaling pathways necessary for inflammation and the generation of protective cd8 t cells. the intracellular bacterium l. monocytogenes has been studied for decades as a model of innate and cellular immunity [1]. infection with l. monocytogenes leads to a robust innate and adaptive response, characterized by the generation of long-lived antigen-specific cd4 and cd8 t cells [2], the latter of which are predominantly responsible for protective immunity [3], [4]. following engulfment by the host cell, l. monocytogenes escapes from the phagosome and into the host cell cytosol via secretion of the pore-forming cytolysin, listeriolysin o (llo) [5]. once within the cytosol, the bacteria express acta that facilitates cell to cell spread via polymerization of host-cell actin [6]. acta-deficient mutants still induce protective immunity, while mutants lacking llo (sometimes designated as δhly) elicit an antigen-specific t cell response, but these t cells are unable to provide protective immunity [7], [8]. escape of l. monocytogenes into the cytosol permits bacterial growth and facilitates the myd88-independent activation of a cytosolic surveillance pathway, leading to the production of a unique array of cytokines, including type i ifn [9] [12]. what remains unclear is why l. monocytogenes, which contains ligands for multiple toll-like receptors (tlrs) [13], is capable of evading the innate immune response and inducing protective immunity in the host [14].
glaucoma is a leading cause of blindness worldwide. primary open-angle glaucoma (poag) is the most common subtype and is a complex trait with multigenic inheritance. genome-wide association studies have previously identified a significant association between poag and the six6 locus (rs10483727, odds ratio (or) = 1. 32, p = 3. 87 × 10 − 11). six6 plays a role in ocular development and has been associated with the morphology of the optic nerve. we sequenced the six6 coding and regulatory regions in 262 poag cases and 256 controls and identified six nonsynonymous coding variants, including five rare and one common variant, asn141his (rs33912345), which was associated significantly with poag (or = 1. 27, p = 4. 2 × 10 − 10) in the neighbor / glaugen datasets. these variants were tested in an in vivo danio rerio (zebrafish) complementation assay to evaluate ocular metrics such as eye size and optic nerve structure. five variants, found primarily in poag cases, were hypomorphic or null, while the sixth variant, found only in controls, was benign. one variant in the six6 enhancer increased expression of six6 and disrupted its regulation. finally, to our knowledge for the first time, we have identified a clinical feature in poag patients that appears to be dependent upon six6 genotype: patients who are homozygous for the six6 risk allele (his141) have a statistically thinner retinal nerve fiber layer than patients homozygous for the six6 non-risk allele (asn141). our results, in combination with previous six6 work, lead us to hypothesize that six6 risk variants disrupt the development of the neural retina, leading to a reduced number of retinal ganglion cells, thereby increasing the risk of glaucoma-associated vision loss. primary open-angle glaucoma (poag) is the most common type of glaucoma, a group of diseases that affect approximately 60 million people worldwide and is a leading cause of blindness [1]. glaucoma is characterized by the progressive death of retinal ganglion cells, leading to optic nerve atrophy and loss of vision. poag is a complex inherited disorder for which an increasing number of genetic associations have been described, each contributing modestly to disease burden [2], [3]. a recent poag genome-wide association study found a significant genetic association (rs10483727, odds ratio (or) = 1. 32, p = 3. 87 × 10 − 11) at the six1 locus [4].

in the human intestinal pathogen clostridium difficile, flagella promote adherence to intestinal epithelial cells. flagellar gene expression also indirectly impacts production of the glucosylating toxins, which are essential to diarrheal disease development. thus, factors that regulate the expression of the flgb operon will likely impact toxin production in addition to flagellar motility. here, we report the identification a flagellar switch that controls the phase variable production of flagella and glucosylating toxins. the flagellar switch, located upstream of the flgb operon containing the early stage flagellar genes, is a 154 bp invertible sequence flanked by 21 bp inverted repeats. bacteria with the sequence in one orientation expressed flagellum and toxin genes, produced flagella, and secreted the toxins (flg phase on). bacteria with the sequence in the inverse orientation were attenuated for flagellar and toxin gene expression, were aflagellate, and showed decreased toxin secretion (flg phase off). the orientation of the flagellar switch is reversible during growth in vitro. we provide evidence that gene regulation via the flagellar switch occurs post-transcription initiation and requires a c. difficile-specific regulatory factor to destabilize or degrade the early flagellar gene mrna when the flagellar switch is in the off orientation. lastly, through mutagenesis and characterization of flagellar phase locked isolates, we determined that the tyrosine recombinase recv, which catalyzes inversion at the cwpv switch, is also responsible for inversion at the flagellar switch in both directions. phase variable flagellar motility and toxin production suggests that these important virulence factors have both advantageous and detrimental effects during the course of infection. clostridium difficile, a gram-positive, spore-forming obligate anaerobe, is the leading cause of nosocomial disease in the north america, europe and australia [1, 2]. the centers for disease control and prevention list c. difficile infections (cdi) as an urgent threat related to the use of antibiotics [3]. antibiotic use perturbs the gastrointestinal microbiota that normally protects against cdi [1, 4]. the rates of recurrence and mortality associated with cdi have increased in part due to the emergence of epidemic-associated strains with enhanced sporulation rates and toxin production [1, 5, 6]. the c. difficile pcr ribotype 027 group is associated with greater odds of diarrheal disease severity, outcome, and death compared to many other pcr ribotypes [7]. therefore, an understanding of bacterial physiology and genetics in c. difficile 027 ribotypes could reveal unique therapeutic or diagnostic targets to ameliorate severe cdi. c. difficile is primarily transmitted as metabolically dormant spores, the spores are resistant to environmental stresses, and the spores germinate upon exposure to environmental cues, such as heat and desiccation.
endosporulation is an ancient bacterial developmental program that culminates with the differentiation of a highly resistant endospore. in the model organism bacillus subtilis, gene expression in the forespore and in the mother cell, the two cells that participate in endospore development, is governed by cell type-specific rna polymerase sigma subunits. σf in the forespore, and σe in the mother cell control early stages of development and are replaced, at later stages, by σg and σk, respectively. starting with σf, the activation of the sigma factors is sequential, requires the preceding factor, and involves cell-cell signaling pathways that operate at key morphological stages. here, we have studied the function and regulation of the sporulation sigma factors in the intestinal pathogen clostridium difficile, an obligate anaerobe in which the endospores are central to the infectious cycle. the morphological characterization of mutants for the sporulation sigma factors, in parallel with use of a fluorescence reporter for single cell analysis of gene expression, unraveled important deviations from the b. subtilis paradigm. while the main periods of activity of the sigma factors are conserved, we show that the activity of σe is partially independent of σf, that σg activity is not dependent on σe, and that the activity of σk does not require σg. we also show that σk is not strictly required for heat resistant spore formation. in all, our results indicate reduced temporal segregation between the activities of the early and late sigma factors, and reduced requirement for the σf-to-σe, σe-to-σg, and σg-to-σk cell-cell signaling pathways. nevertheless, our results support the view that the top level of the endosporulation network is conserved in evolution, with the sigma factors acting as the key regulators of the pathway, established some 2. 5 billion years ago upon its emergence at the base of the firmicutes phylum. endosporulation is an ancient bacterial cell differentiation program that culminates with the formation of a highly resistant dormant cell, the endospore. bacterial endospores (hereinafter designated spores for simplicity), as those formed by species of the well-known bacillus and clostridium genera, but also by many other groups within the firmicutes phylum, resist to extremes of physical and chemical parameters that would rapidly destroy the vegetative cells, and are the most resistant cellular structure known [1], [2]. their resilience allows them to accumulate in highly diverse environmental settings, often for extremely long periods of time. the range of environments in which spores are formed, and the range of conditions in which they germinate, is much broader than previously thought [3, 4].
we explore a framework to model the dose response of allosteric multisite phosphorylation proteins using a single auxiliary variable. this reduction can closely replicate the steady state behavior of detailed multisite systems such as the monod-wyman-changeux allosteric model or rule-based models. optimal ultrasensitivity is obtained when the activation of an allosteric protein by its individual sites is concerted and redundant. the reduction makes this framework useful for modeling and analyzing biochemical systems in practical applications, where several multisite proteins may interact simultaneously. as an application we analyze a newly discovered checkpoint signaling pathway in budding yeast, which has been proposed to measure cell growth by monitoring signals generated at sites of plasma membrane growth. we show that the known components of this pathway can form a robust hysteretic switch. in particular, this system incorporates a signal proportional to bud growth or size, a mechanism to read the signal, and an all-or-none response triggered only when the signal reaches a threshold indicating that sufficient growth has occurred. protein phosphorylation is a common form of post-translational modification frequently used in nature to alter protein activity, for instance by changing the electrostatic properties of the protein or its spatial structure. the phosphorylation of the same protein at multiple different aminoacid residues is also very common, and it is found in proteins such as p53 [1], sic1 [2], egfr [3], wee1 [4], ste5 [5] and many others [6]. the differences in the function of single-site vs. multisite phosphorylation are not completely understood. many multisite proteins are involved in regulatory processes that can benefit from the presence of bistability, hysteresis, or limit cycles, which require sufficiently nonlinear interactions in addition to the right type of feedback [7], [8]. a reasonable hypothesis is that multisite phosphorylation can give rise to ultrasensitive dose responses, in a way that would not be possible in a comparable single-site system [9] [13]. many detailed mechanisms have also been proposed to explain the role of multisite systems in the emergence of bistability (for examples, see [14], [15]). on the other hand, such detailed multisite mechanisms are normally not used as part of actual mathematical models of biochemical interactions. this is because explicitly modeling multiple sites usually involves the introduction of numerous variables, one or more for each phosphorylation state, and realistic models are often too complex already to justify this additional effort. systems that attempt to model biochemical reactions explicitly often use the assumption that the protein has two states, one active and one inactive, with the active state dependent on the phosphorylation state of the other site.
quorum sensing (qs) enables bacterial multicellularity and selective advantage for communicating populations. while genetic switching phenomena are a common feature, their mechanistic underpinnings have remained elusive. the interplay between circuit components and their regulation are intertwined and embedded. observable phenotypes are complex and context dependent. we employed a combination of experimental work and mathematical models to decipher network connectivity and signal transduction in the autoinducer-2 (ai-2) quorum sensing system of e. coli. negative and positive feedback mechanisms were examined by separating the network architecture into sub-networks. a new unreported negative feedback interaction was hypothesized and tested via a simple mathematical model. also, the importance of the lsrr regulator and its determinant role in the e. coli qs switch, normally masked by interfering regulatory loops, were revealed. our simple model allowed mechanistic understanding of the interplay among regulatory sub-structures and their contributions to the overall native functioning network. this bottom up approach in understanding gene regulation will serve to unravel complex qs network architectures and lead to the directed coordination of emergent behaviors. biological phenomena are frequently controlled by an entangled web of protein and gene networks that constitute regulatory pathways. a large number of such pathways take advantage of environmental cues and signaling molecules to regulate cellular activities. however it is not always clear how biological systems are able to support accurate signal propagation over a sufficiently large dynamic range within the cell. one important factor in determining the fidelity of a signal, in any biological system, is the connectivity of the network, e. g., the interactions among the constituent genes, proteins and metabolites. recent studies indicate that certain patterns of local connectivity such as negative and positive feedback motifs are more frequently found in natural systems [1], [2]. despite their individual abilities to influence the flow of information, negative and positive feedback loops are often coupled together in natural systems. one example is the xenopus embryonic cell cycle where a negative feedback loop and a pair of positive feedback loops control the operation of a robust tunable cell cycle oscillator [3]. several synthetic oscillators have also been built to demonstrate the robust behavior that results from the interaction of various feedback motifs [4] [6]. in this paper, we examined network connectivity in a natural network which also employs a combination of negative and positive regulation and, at the same time, provides cell-cell communication among bacterial cells. here, an auto-regulatory network is coupled with a double negative motif to provide a population based response known as bacterial quorum sensing (qs). we examined the network connectivity and followed a bottom up approach to elucidate the interplay between network architecture and signaling mechanisms in this system.
malaria burden remains high in the sub-saharan region where helminths are prevalent and where children are often infected with both types of parasites. although the effect of helminths on malaria infection is evident, the impact of these co-infections is not clearly elucidated yet and the scarce findings are conflicting. in this study, we investigated the effect of schistosomiasis, considering soil-transmitted helminths (sth), on prevalence and incidence of plasmodium falciparum infection. this longitudinal survey was conducted in school-age children living in two rural communities in the vicinity of lambaréné, gabon. thick blood smear light microscopy, urine filtration and the kato-katz technique were performed to detect malaria parasites, s. haematobium eggs and, sth eggs, respectively. p. falciparum carriage was assessed at inclusion, and incidence of malaria and time to the first malaria event were recorded in correlation with schistosoma carriage status. stratified multivariate analysis using generalized linear model was used to assess the risk of plasmodium infection considering interaction with sth, and survival analysis to assess time to malaria. the overall prevalence on subject enrolment was 30%, 23% and 9% for s. haematobium, p. falciparum infections and co-infection with both parasites, respectively. our results showed that schistosomiasis in children tends to increase the risk of plasmodium infection but a combined effect with trichuris trichiura or hookworm infection clearly increase the risk (aor = 3. 9 [95% ci: 1. 7 9. 2]). the incidence of malaria over time was 0. 51 [95% ci: 0. 45 0. 57] per person-year and was higher in the schistosoma-infected group compared to the non-infected group (0. 61 vs 0. 43, p = 0. 02), with a significant delay of time-to first-malaria event only in children aged from 6 to 10-years-old infected with schistosoma haematobium. our results suggest that sth enhance the risk for p. falciparum infection in schistosomiasis-positive children, and when infected, that schistosomiasis enhances susceptibility to developing malaria in young children but not in older children. over the past fifteen years, morbidity and mortality due to malaria have globally decreased. however, sub-saharan africa, where 90% cases of malaria and 92% of deaths related to malaria have occurred in 2015, still bears the highest burden of the disease [1]. most of these cases remain confined to rural and semi-urban areas [2 4] where helminths are co-prevalent [5].

inflammation is known to be necessary for promoting, sustaining, and tuning cd8 + t cell responses. following experimental leishmania donovani infection, the inflammatory response is mainly induced by the transcription factor irf-5. irf-5 is responsible for the activation of several genes encoding key pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as il-6 and tnf. here, we investigate the role of irf-5-mediated inflammation in regulating antigen-specific cd8 + t cell responses during l. donovani infection. our data demonstrate that the inflammatory response induced by irf-5 limits cd8 + t cell expansion and induces hif-1α in dendritic cells. ablation of hif-1α in cd11c + cells resulted into a higher frequency of short-lived effector cells (slec), enhanced cd8 + t cell expansion, and increased il-12 expression by splenic dcs. moreover, mice with a targeted depletion of hif-1α in cd11c + cells had a significantly lower splenic parasite burden, suggesting that induction of hif-1α may represent an immune evasive mechanism adopted by leishmania parasites to establish persistent infections. maintenance of a proper balance between inflammatory and anti-inflammatory responses is essential for achieving effective immunity against infectious pathogens while limiting collateral inflammatory damage to the tissue. however, immunosuppressive responses are sometimes generated in excess. this event often results in the strong inhibition of protective pro-inflammatory responses and leads to susceptibility to infectious pathogens, such as plasmodium [1, 2], leishmania [3, 4], lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus [5, 6], and mycobacteria spp. [7]. visceral leishmaniasis (vl) is a good example of dysregulated balance between inflammatory and anti-inflammatory responses. vl is a potentially lethal disease caused by leishmania donovani and l. infantum / chagasi. leishmania are protozoan parasites, existing as flagellated promastigotes within sandflies and as intracellular amastigotes in infected mammals. in the host, leishmania preferentially infects macrophages; however, it can also be found in other cells, such as dcs, neutrophils, and fibroblasts [8 12]. vl is characterized by persistent infection of the spleen and by immunodeficiency during the chronic stage [13]. experimental infection with l. donovani results in pathogen-induced disruption of the splenic microarchitecture, which involves both the disruption of the marginal zone and the b-cell follicles, and the progressive loss of stromal cells [14, 15]. this disruption is mediated by tnf [16], a cytokine that is overexpressed during vl [17, 18]. interestingly, tnf deficient mice infected with l. donovani have a lower il-10 mrna accumulation in the spleen compared to wild-type mice [19].
in the current context of high fatality rates associated with american visceral leishmaniasis (vl), the appropriate use of prognostic factors to identify patients at higher risk of unfavorable outcomes represents a potential tool for clinical practice. this systematic review brings together information reported in studies conducted in latin america, on the potential predictors of adverse prognosis (continued evolution of the initial clinical conditions of the patient despite the implementation of treatment, independent of the occurrence of death) and death from vl. the limitations of the existing knowledge, the advances achieved and the approaches to be used in future research are presented. the full texts of 14 studies conforming to the inclusion criteria were analyzed and their methodological quality examined by means of a tool developed in the light of current research tools. information regarding prognostic variables was synthesized using meta-analysis. variables were grouped according to the strength of evidence considering summary measures, patterns and heterogeneity of effect-sizes, and the results of multivariate analyses. the strongest predictors identified in this review were jaundice, thrombocytopenia, hemorrhage, hiv coinfection, diarrhea, age < 5 and age > 40 50 years, severe neutropenia, dyspnoea and bacterial infections. edema and low hemoglobin concentration were also associated with unfavorable outcomes. the main limitation identified was the absence of validation procedures for the few prognostic models developed so far. integration of the results from different investigations conducted over the last 10 years enabled the identification of consistent prognostic variables that could be useful in recognizing and handling vl patients at higher risk of unfavorable outcomes. the development of externally validated prognostic models must be prioritized in future investigations. visceral leishmaniasis (vl) constitutes a serious public health problem in endemic regions, especially in the indian sub-continent, in north and east africa, and in south america. however, vl is one of the most neglected diseases in the world [1], closely associated with poverty, for which effective and affordable chemotherapies remain scarce [2], [3]. in brazil, american vl was originally confined almost entirely to rural areas in the northeast of the country, but since the 1980s the disease has spread to large cities in the northeast, southeast and center-west regions of the country [4]. during the first decade of the 21st century, some 40, 000 cases of vl and 2, 500 vl-related deaths were reported in the country with no signs of a significant reduction in the fatality rates [5], [6]. in the americas, the transmission of vl to humans occurs through the bite of female phlebotomine sandflies of the genus lutzomyia, which hosts the promastigote form of leishmania (viannia) spp.
in algeria, the treatment of visceral and cutaneous leishmanioses (vl and cl) has been and continues to be based on antimony-containing drugs. it is suspected that high drug selective pressure might favor the emergence of chemoresistant parasites. although treatment failure is frequently reported during antimonial therapy of both cl and vl, antimonial resistance has never been thoroughly investigated in algeria. determining the level of antimonial susceptibility, amongst leishmania transmitted in algeria, is of great importance for the development of public health policies. within the framework of the knowledge about the epidemiology of vl and cl amassed during the last 30 years, we sampled leishmania isolates to determine their susceptibility to antimony. we analyzed a total of 106 isolates including 88 isolates collected between 1976 and 2013 in algeria from humans, dogs, rodents, and phlebotomines and 18 collected from dogs in france. all the algerian isolates were collected in 14 localities where leishmaniasis is endemic. the 50% inhibitory concentrations (ic50) of potassium antimony tartrate (the trivalent form of antimony, sb (iii)) and sodium stibogluconate (the pentavalent form of antimony, sb (v)) were determined in promastigotes and intramacrophage amastigotes, respectively. the epidemiological cutoff (ecoff) that allowed us to differentiate between leishmania species causing cutaneous or visceral leishmaniases that were susceptible (s +) or insusceptible (s-) to the trivalent form of antimony was determined. the computed ic50 cutoff values were 23. 83 μg / ml and 15. 91 μg / ml for vl and cl, respectively. we report a trend of increasing antimony susceptibility in vl isolates during the 30-year period. in contrast, an increase in the frequency of s- phenotypes in isolates causing cl was observed during the same period. in our study, the emergence of s- phenotypes correlates with the inclusion of l. killicki (syn: l. tropica) isolates that cause cutaneous leishmaniasis and that have emerged in algeria during the last decade. our results provide insight into the spatiotemporal dynamics of leishmania antimony susceptibility in algeria. we highlight the need for the future implementation of an effective methodology to determine the antimony susceptibility status of leishmania isolates to detect the emergence of and prevent the dissemination of drug-resistant strains. leishmaniasis are vector-borne diseases caused by obligate parasites from the genus leishmania (trypanosomatida: trypanosomatidae). this genus is subdivided into two major phylogenetic lineages: eulimnadia (l.
crohn s disease (cd) is a chronic inflammatory condition of diverse etiology. exposure to foodborne pathogens causing acute gastroenteritis produces a long-term risk of cd well into the post-infectious period but the mechanistic basis for this ongoing relationship to disease onset is unknown. we developed two novel models to study the comorbidity of acute gastroenteritis caused by salmonella typhimurium or citrobacter rodentium in mice colonized with adherent-invasive escherichia coli (aiec), a bacterial pathobiont linked to cd. here, we show that disease activity in the post-infectious period after gastroenteritis is driven by the tissue-associated expansion of the resident aiec pathobiont, with an attendant increase in immunopathology, barrier defects, and delays in mucosal restitution following pathogen clearance. these features required aiec resistance to host defense peptides and a fulminant inflammatory response to the enteric pathogen. our results suggest that individuals colonized by aiec at the time of acute infectious gastroenteritis may be at greater risk for cd onset. importantly, our data identify aiec as a tractable disease modifier, a finding that could be exploited in the development of therapeutic interventions following infectious gastroenteritis in at-risk individuals. inflammation in crohn s disease (cd) can involve the small and large bowel and is accompanied by changes in the microbial composition and distribution at these sites [1 3]. clinical observations have been consistent in finding increased numbers of bacteria associated with the epithelial mucosa in crohn s patients, including members of the enterobacteriaceae that are enriched in virulence and secretion pathways as determined by culture and molecular methods [4 6]. although a detailed microbiologic analysis of this population has not been done and their role in disease has not been described, these data imply that the environment favoring bacterial expansion at the mucosal surface is inflammatory in nature and that this particular bacterial bloom is of pathogenic significance in the disease. among bacteria linked to cd, adherent-invasive e. coli (aiec) have emerged as having likely pathogenic significance. since its discovery in 1998 [7], several laboratories have reported a higher prevalence of aiec in cd patients compared to healthy subjects and confirmed their pro-inflammatory potential [5, 8, 9]. although aiec share evolutionary ancestry with extraintestinal pathogenic e. coli [10], their infection biology suggests a pathobiont lifestyle that is distinct from frank enteric pathogens. a growing body of work indicates that different host environments can select for aiec. for example, aiec isolated from adults [5, 10 12], children [13, 14], and neonates [15] are more virulent than aiec from older children and adults [16, 17].
in flowering plants, the egg and sperm cells form within haploid gametophytes. the female gametophyte of arabidopsis consists of two gametic cells, the egg cell and the central cell, which are flanked by five accessory cells. both gametic and accessory cells are vital for fertilization; however, the mechanisms that underlie the formation of accessory versus gametic cell fate are unknown. in a screen for regulators of egg cell fate, we isolated the lachesis (lis) mutant which forms supernumerary egg cells. in lis mutants, accessory cells differentiate gametic cell fate, indicating that lis is involved in a mechanism that prevents accessory cells from adopting gametic cell fate. the temporal and spatial pattern of lis expression suggests that this mechanism is generated in gametic cells. lis is homologous to the yeast splicing factor prp4, indicating that components of the splice apparatus participate in cell fate decisions. the formation of gametes is a key step in the lifecycle of any sexually reproducing organism. in flowering plants, the egg and sperm cells develop within haploid gametophytes (figure 1). the female gametophyte of arabidopsis originates from a single haploid spore (figure 1a) through three nuclear division cycles. the resulting syncytium of eight nuclei (figure 1b) cellularizes and differentiates four distinct cell fates [1 4] (figure 1c and 1d). both the egg and central cells are fertilized by one sperm cell each to form the embryo and the surrounding endosperm, respectively. these gametic cells are flanked by accessory cells. two synergids lie at the micropylar pole, the entry point of the pollen tube. synergids are necessary for the attraction of the pollen tube and induce the subsequent release of the sperm cells [5 7]. the opposite pole is occupied by three antipodal cells that degenerate prior to fertilization and whose function is unclear [3]. although collections of female gametophytic mutants have been reported [8, 9], mechanisms that underlie the specification of gametic versus accessory cell fate are unknown. in the present study, we took advantage of an egg cell specific marker that we isolated in a screen for enhancer detector (et) and gene trap (gt) lines, to examine the regulation of gametic cell fate. our results indicate that a combinatorial mechanism operates to ensure maximum likelihood that the key reproductive gametic cells are formed, while at the same time deleterious excess gametic cell formation is prevented. we performed a screen for ethyl methanesulfonate (ems) -induced mutants that alter the expression of the enhancer detector line et1119, and we identified two ems-induced mutants, lis-1 and lis 2, that form supernumerary egg cell-like cells.
the role of footwear in protection against a range of neglected tropical diseases (ntds) is gaining increasing attention. better understanding of the behaviors that influence use of footwear will lead to improved ability to measure shoe use and will be important for those implementing footwear programs. using the precede-proceed model we assessed social, behavioral, environmental, educational and ecological needs influencing whether and when children wear shoes in a rural highland ethiopian community endemic for podoconiosis. information was gathered from 242 respondents using focus groups, semi-structured interviews and extended case studies. shoe-wearing norms were said to be changing, with going barefoot increasingly seen as shameful. shoes were thought to confer dignity as well as protection against injury and cold. however, many practical and social barriers prevented the desire to wear shoes from being translated into practice. limited financial resources meant that people were neither able to purchase more than one pair of shoes to ensure their longevity nor afford shoes of the preferred quality. as a result of this limited access, shoes were typically preserved for special occasions and might not be provided for children until they reached a certain age. while some barriers (for example fit of shoe and fear of labeling through use of a certain type of shoe) may be applicable only to certain diseases, underlying structural level barriers related to poverty (for example price, quality, unsuitability for daily activities and low risk perception) are likely to be relevant to a range of ntds. using well established conceptual models of health behavior adoption, we identified several barriers to shoe wearing that are amenable to intervention and which we anticipate will be of benefit to those considering ntd prevention through shoe distribution. interest is growing in the use of footwear in the primary prevention of certain neglected tropical diseases (ntds). while evidence for a protective role of footwear against podoconiosis [1] [3] and chronic larva migrans [4], [5] is relatively strong, evidence for the role of shoes is inconsistent in relation to hookworm, with some studies finding evidence of protection from footwear [6], [7], but other studies finding no effect [8] [11]. evidence is also inconsistent for other helminthiases [10], [12] [15] and buruli ulcer [16], [17]. for snakebite and tungiasis, evidence of protection is circumstantial, and based on the predilection of bites [18] and [19] to occur on the feet.
the pseudorabies virus (prv) us9 protein plays a central role in targeting viral capsids and glycoproteins to axons of dissociated sympathetic neurons. as a result, us9 null mutants are defective in anterograde transmission of infection in vivo. however, it is unclear how us9 promotes axonal sorting of so many viral proteins. it is known that the glycoproteins gb, gc, gd and ge are associated with lipid raft microdomains on the surface of infected swine kidney cells and monocytes, and are directed into the axon in a us9-dependent manner. in this report, we determined that us9 is associated with lipid rafts, and that this association is critical to us9-mediated sorting of viral structural proteins. we used infected non-polarized and polarized pc12 cells, a rat pheochromocytoma cell line that acquires many of the characteristics of sympathetic neurons in the presence of nerve growth factor (ngf). in these cells, us9 is highly enriched in detergent-resistant membranes (drms). moreover, reducing the affinity of us9 for lipid rafts inhibited anterograde transmission of infection from sympathetic neurons to epithelial cells in vitro. we conclude that association of us9 with lipid rafts is key for efficient targeting of structural proteins to axons and, as a consequence, for directional spread of prv from pre-synaptic to post-synaptic neurons and cells of the mammalian nervous system. neurons are highly polarized cells with distinct biochemical and functional properties particular to the cell body (soma), dendrites, and the axon. soluble, cytosolic proteins likely move into axons and dendrites by bulk flow, while membrane proteins are highly restricted to the somatodendritic membrane, the axonal membrane, or within vesicles [1]. sorting of membrane proteins to the somatodendritic or axonal compartments of neurons is similar to the sorting mechanism of membrane proteins either to the basolateral or to the apical membranes of epithelial cells [2]. both cell types share a common component for compartmentalization of their membrane milieu: lipid raft microdomains. rafts often are defined biochemically as detergent-resistant membranes (drms) or detergent-insoluble glycolipid complexes (digs) [3] [5]. these protein-lipid complexes are highly enriched in cholesterol and sphingolipids, and float freely within the liquid-disordered state of the lipid bilayer. furthermore, they are small and dynamic, often ordering themselves into larger, more stable rafts through protein-protein and protein-lipid interactions [6], [7]. lipid rafts / drms play a key role in the axonal sorting of membrane proteins during neuronal development [8] and regeneration [9], as well as in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases.
genetically identical cells exhibit extensive phenotypic variation even under constant and benign conditions. this so-called nongenetic heterogeneity has important clinical implications: within tumors and microbial infections, cells show nongenetic heterogeneity in growth rate and in susceptibility to drugs or stress. the budding yeast, saccharomyces cerevisiae, shows a similar form of nongenetic heterogeneity in which growth rate correlates positively with susceptibility to acute heat stress at the single-cell level. using genetic and chemical perturbations, combined with high-throughput single-cell assays of yeast growth and gene expression, we show here that heterogeneity in intracellular cyclic amp (camp) levels acting through the conserved ras / camp / protein kinase a (pka) pathway and its target transcription factors, msn2 and msn4, underlies this nongenetic heterogeneity. lower levels of camp correspond to slower growth, as shown by direct comparison of camp concentration in subpopulations enriched for slower vs. faster growing cells. concordantly, an endogenous reporter of this pathway s activity correlates with growth in individual cells. the paralogs msn2 and msn4 differ in their roles in nongenetic heterogeneity in a way that demonstrates slow growth and stress tolerance are not inevitably linked. heterogeneity in growth rate requires each, whereas only msn2 is required for heterogeneity in expression of tsl1, a subunit of trehalose synthase that contributes to acute-stress tolerance. perturbing nongenetic heterogeneity by mutating genes in this pathway, or by culturing wild-type cells with the cell-permeable camp analog 8-bromo-camp or the pka inhibitor h89, significantly impacts survival of acute heat stress. perturbations that increase intracellular camp levels reduce the slower-growing subpopulation and increase susceptibility to acute heat stress, whereas pka inhibition slows growth and decreases susceptibility to acute heat stress. loss of msn2 reduces, but does not completely eliminate, the correlation in individual cells between growth rate and acute-stress survival, suggesting a major role for the msn2 pathway in nongenetic heterogeneity but also a residual benefit of slow growth. our results shed light on the genetic control of nongenetic heterogeneity and suggest a possible means of defeating bet-hedging pathogens or tumor cells by making them more uniformly susceptible to treatment. for any particular trait, genetically identical individuals raised in identical environments may still differ. this phenomenon is termed phenotypic variability or nongenetic heterogeneity [1]. examples of nongenetic heterogeneity include clonal microbial cultures in which cells differ in gene activity, growth and tolerance of stress or drug treatments [2 8]. tumor cells also display nongenetic heterogeneity in gene expression and growth rate [9] in addition to genetic heterogeneity, there is also phenotypic variability in the growth rate of individual cells within tumors.
chikungunya virus (chikv), an alphavirus and member of the togaviridae family, is capable of causing severe febrile disease in humans. in december of 2013 the asian lineage of chikv spread from the old world to the americas, spreading rapidly throughout the new world. given this new emergence in naïve populations we studied the viral genetic diversity present in infected individuals to understand how chikv may have evolved during this continuing outbreak. we used deep-sequencing technologies coupled with well-established bioinformatics pipelines to characterize the minority variants and diversity present in chikv infected individuals from guadeloupe and martinique, two islands in the center of the epidemic. we observed changes in the consensus sequence as well as a diverse range of minority variants present at various levels in the population. furthermore, we found that overall diversity was dramatically reduced after single passages in cell lines. finally, we constructed an infectious clone from this outbreak and identified a novel 3 untranslated region (utr) structure, not previously found in nature, that led to increased replication in insect cells. here we preformed an intrahost quasispecies analysis of the new chikv outbreak in the caribbean. we identified novel variants present in infected individuals, as well as a new 3 utr structure, suggesting that chikv has rapidly evolved in a short period of time once it entered this naïve population. these studies highlight the need to continue viral diversity surveillance over time as this epidemic evolves in order to understand the evolutionary potential of chikv. arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) pose an eminent threat to public health worldwide and are continuously re-emerging or spreading to uninfected areas. in particular, chikungunya virus (chikv) has recently spread to the americas to cause an estimated 1. 7 million cases of severe, debilitating and often chronic arthralgia after roughly 60 years of circulation within africa and asia [1] [2] [3] [4]. this raises questions on how chikv will spread, evolve, and adapt in new environments in the near future. previous epidemics of chikv have been attributed to adaptive mutations within the viral glycoproteins, allowing the virus to more readily infect the asian tiger mosquito aedes albopictus, and thus increase its transmission throughout areas of the world harboring this mosquito species. interestingly, the chikv strain that has arrived to the americas is from the asian lineage and does not contain these adaptive mutations as of yet. however, both aedes aegypti and albopictus are prevalent throughout many parts of north and south america [5] that, along with an increasing number of other arboviruses, may have contributed to the recent emergence of this virus [6] [7].
the mtor signaling pathways regulate cell growth and are involved in multiple human diseases. here, we identify ubtor, a previously unannotated gene as a functional player in regulating cell growth and mtor signaling. reduction of ubtor function in cultured hippocampal neurons and pc12 cells promotes neurite outgrowth. ubtor depletion activates mtor signaling and promotes cell growth, whilst ubtor overexpression suppresses colony formation in cancer cell lines. studies in cultured cells and zebrafish model show that ubtor inhibits mtor signaling by stabilizing the mtor complex component deptor, and ubtor gene disruption result in higher mtor activity and aggravate hras (g12v) induced neoplasia in the zebrafish. lastly, ubtor depletion promotes tumor growth and mtor signaling in a xenograft mouse model. together, our results demonstrate how ubtor regulates cell growth and neoplasia via mtor signaling. mechanistic target of rapamycin (mtor) signaling is a central pathway that controls cell metabolism, growth, proliferation and survival. clinically the mtor pathway is implicated in human diseases including tumor formation, obesity, epilepsy, autism and neurodegeneration [1 3]. mtor signaling activity is regulated by various factors at multiple cellular organelles [4]. the central catalytic protein mtor forms two complexes mtorc1 and mtorc2 through interactions with a number of proteins. these mtor interacting proteins exert important regulatory roles on mtor activity. a protein of interest is deptor, a component of both mtor complexes and an inhibitor of mtor signaling found only in the vertebrate species [5]. deptor is phosphorylated and ubiquitylated when mtorc1 signaling pathway is activated by serum stimulation, which subsequently results in its degradation [6 8]. here, we identify ubtor as a functional player in regulating cell growth and mtor signaling. ubtor is a vertebrate-specific, previously unannotated gene except being listed as a downregulated or mutated gene in tumor tissues [9 11]. ubtor encodes a protein without any known functional domains. we first show reductions of ubtor expression levels in cultured hippocampal neurons and pc12 cells promote neurite outgrowth. in addition, ubtor depletion promotes cell growth in hek293t and u87mg cells, whilst ubtor overexpression suppresses colony formation in hek293t and t24 cells. we next show reduction of ubtor promotes mtor signaling. mechanistic studies in cultured cells show ubtor interacts with deptor and mtor complexes. further studies show ubtor stabilizes deptor and regulates deptor s ubiquitination. lastly, ubtor gene disruption in zebrafish increases mtor activity and aggravates hras-induced neoplasia.
the functions of the majority of trypanosomatid-specific proteins are unknown, hindering our understanding of the biology and pathogenesis of trypanosomatida. while protein-protein interactions are highly informative about protein function, a global map of protein interactions and complexes is still lacking for these important human parasites. here, benefiting from in-depth biochemical fractionation, we systematically interrogated the co-complex interactions of more than 3354 protein groups in procyclic life stage of trypanosoma brucei, the protozoan parasite responsible for human african trypanosomiasis. using a rigorous methodology, our analysis led to identification of 128 high-confidence complexes encompassing 716 protein groups, including 635 protein groups that lacked experimental annotation. these complexes correlate well with known pathways as well as for proteins co-expressed across the t. brucei life cycle, and provide potential functions for a large number of previously uncharacterized proteins. we validated the functions of several novel proteins associated with the rna-editing machinery, identifying a candidate potentially involved in the mitochondrial post-transcriptional regulation of t. brucei. our data provide an unprecedented view of the protein complex map of t. brucei, and serve as a reliable resource for further characterization of trypanosomatid proteins. the presented results in this study are available at: www. trypsnetdb. org. the unicellular flagellated parasite trypanosoma brucei is the causative agent of the fatal human african trypanosomiasis (hat), also known as sleeping sickness, and the economically devastating disease nagana in cattle. the life cycle of t. brucei comprise an insect stage (procyclic stage) and a mammalian stage. trypanosomatid parasites, including t. brucei, are highly diverged from well-studied eukaryotes such as yeast and mammals [1 3], resulting in a lack of sequence similarity with model organisms for the majority of their proteins. this has led to inapplicability of homology-based approaches for identification of potential functions of more than half of all trypanosomatid genes [4]. protein interaction maps offer an invaluable resource for functional annotation of proteins [5]. current methodological / instrumental advances have led to the development of several ex vivo, in vivo, and in silico approaches to systematically chart protein interactions and complexes [6]. optimized yeast two-hybrid (y2h) approaches have been employed to infer pairwise interactions among proteins [7, 8]. immunoprecipitation [9], biochemical fractionation [10 13], and affinity purification (ap) -based approaches [14 16] are widely used for the identification of protein complexes in a specific cell context.
tuberculosis is commonly considered a chronic lung disease, however, extrapulmonary infection can occur in any organ. even though lymph nodes (ln) are among the most common sites of extrapulmonary mycobacterium tuberculosis (mtb) infection, and thoracic lns are frequently infected in humans, bacterial dynamics and the effect of mtb infection in ln structure and function is relatively unstudied. we surveyed thoracic lns from mtb-infected cynomolgus and rhesus macaques analyzing pet ct scans, bacterial burden, ln structure and immune function. fdg avidity correlated with the presence of live bacteria in lns at necropsy. lymph nodes have different trajectories (increasing, maintaining, decreasing in pet activity over time) even within the same animal. rhesus macaques are more susceptible to mtb infection than cynomolgus macaques and this is in part due to more extensive ln pathology. here, we show that mtb grows to the same level in cynomolgus and rhesus macaque lns, however, cynomolgus macaques control mtb at later time points post-infection while rhesus macaques do not. notably, compared to lung granulomas, lns are generally poor at killing mtb, even with drug treatment. granulomas that form in lns lack b cell-rich tertiary lymphoid structures, disrupt ln structure by pushing out t cells and b cells, introduce large numbers of macrophages that can serve as niches for mtb, and destroy normal vasculature. our data support that lns are not only sites of antigen presentation and immune activation during infection, but also serve as important sites for persistence of significant numbers of mtb bacilli. tuberculosis (tb) is one of the significant causes of morbidity and mortality in the world. it is estimated that 2. 3 billion people worldwide are infected with mycobacterium tuberculosis (mtb), the causative agent of tb. in 2016, there were an estimated 10. 4 million new tb cases and 1. 6 million deaths [1]. although the most common site of infection and disease is the lungs, extrapulmonary tb also occurs, and lymph nodes (ln) are the most common sites of extrapulmonary mtb infection [2, 3]. in humans, it has been classically observed that a tuberculous pulmonary lesion is almost always accompanied by a granulomatous thoracic ln; this is called a ghon complex [4, 5]. moreover, reports of tb-associated cervical lymphadenitis (scrofula) span from antiquity to the present [6 8]. historically, it was not known whether scrofula was related to tb [6], but some individuals with scrofula eventually died from tb-associated disease including tb meningitis and pneumonia, suggesting a relationship between these dissimilar-appearing pathologies [6 9].
microsporidia are fungi-related intracellular pathogens that may infect virtually all animals, but are poorly understood. the nematode caenorhabditis elegans has recently become a model host for studying microsporidia through the identification of its natural microsporidian pathogen nematocida parisii. however, it was unclear how widespread and diverse microsporidia infections are in c. elegans or other related nematodes in the wild. here we describe the isolation and culture of 47 nematodes with microsporidian infections. n. parisii is found to be the most common microsporidia infecting c. elegans in the wild. in addition, we further describe and name six new species in the nematocida genus. our sampling and phylogenetic analysis further identify two subclades that are genetically distinct from nematocida, and we name them enteropsectra and pancytospora. interestingly, unlike nematocida, these two genera belong to the main clade of microsporidia that includes human pathogens. all of these microsporidia are horizontally transmitted and most specifically infect intestinal cells, except pancytospora epiphaga that replicates mostly in the epidermis of its caenorhabditis host. at the subcellular level in the infected host cell, spores of the novel genus enteropsectra show a characteristic apical distribution and exit via budding off of the plasma membrane, instead of exiting via exocytosis as spores of nematocida. host specificity is broad for some microsporidia, narrow for others: indeed, some microsporidia can infect oscheius tipulae but not its sister species oscheius sp. 3, and conversely some microsporidia found infecting oscheius sp. 3 do not infect o. tipulae. we also show that n. ausubeli fails to strongly induce in c. elegans the transcription of genes that are induced by other nematocida species, suggesting it has evolved mechanisms to prevent induction of this host response. altogether, these newly isolated species illustrate the diversity and ubiquity of microsporidian infections in nematodes, and provide a rich resource to investigate host-parasite coevolution in tractable nematode hosts. microsporidia are fungi-related obligate intracellular pathogens, with over 1400 described species [1, 2]. interest in these organisms started 150 years ago when researchers, especially louis pasteur, studied silkworm disease that was caused by a microsporidian species later named nosema bombycis [3]. in the past decades, microsporidia have attracted more attention when they were revealed to be a cause of diarrhea in immunocompromised patients [4, 5].
chemokine receptors, a subclass of g protein coupled receptors (gpcrs), play essential roles in the human immune system, they are involved in cancer metastasis as well as in hiv-infection. a plethora of studies show that homo- and heterodimers or even higher order oligomers of the chemokine receptors cxcr4, ccr5, and ccr2 modulate receptor function. in addition, membrane cholesterol affects chemokine receptor activity. however, structural information about homo- and heterodimers formed by chemokine receptors and their interplay with cholesterol is limited. here, we report homo- and heterodimer configurations of the chemokine receptors cxcr4, ccr5, and ccr2 at atomistic detail, as obtained from thousands of molecular dynamics simulations. the observed homodimerization patterns were similar for the closely related cc chemokine receptors, yet they differed significantly between the cc receptors and cxcr4. despite their high sequence identity, cholesterol modulated the cc homodimer interfaces in a subtype-specific manner. chemokine receptor heterodimers display distinct dimerization patterns for cxcr4 / ccr5 and cxcr4 / ccr2. furthermore, associations between cxcr4 and ccr5 reveal an increased cholesterol-sensitivity as compared to cxcr4 / ccr2 heterodimerization patterns. this work provides a first comprehensive structural overview over the complex interaction network between chemokine receptors and indicates how heterodimerization and the interaction with the membrane environment diversifies the function of closely related gpcrs. g protein coupled receptors (gpcrs) constitute one of the largest groups of cell surface transmembrane receptors [1]. all members of this protein family share the typical architecture of seven transmembrane helices (tm1-7) connected via three intra- and three extracellular loops (icl and ecl, respectively). in general, the receptors sense external signals with their extracellular segment, while g proteins couple to the intracellular domain. usually, an additional amphipathic helix 8 (h8) is formed by residues between the last transmembrane helix (tm7) and the intracellular c-terminus [2]. a small subgroup of class a gpcrs is formed by so-called chemokine receptors [3]. these receptors cater for the targeted migration of cells belonging to the immune system and play an essential role in the inflammatory response [4]. consequently, chemokine receptors became intriguing candidates for therapeutic targets in inflammatory diseases [5]. in addition, certain chemokine receptors have been reported to play important roles in tumor progression as well as metastasis [6] and were shown to function as co-receptors for the human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) during cell infection [7]. depending on the relative positions of the n-terminal cysteine residues of the agonist chemokine, typical chemokine receptors can be divided into four subfamilies: xcr1, ccr2, ccr3, and ccr5 [8].
systemic leishmaniasis has been known to present with prolonged fever, hepatosplenomegaly and wasting. beside this classical form, a sub-clinical form has been identified. it is described with either one or two of the above symptoms missing; other findings have been reported instead, such as lymphadenopathy and anemia. in this report, we reveal a third unsuspected form which we are referring to as atypical. patients suspected to be immune-deficient were referred to our immunology specialized laboratory to study some aspects of their immune functions (not normally covered in the general laboratory). multiple specialized tests were performed, including microscopic examinations using appropriate stains, and mainly cultures of biopsies on several types of specialized media. 19 · 4% of 160 patients were found to have close to normal laboratory profiles, but exhibited dysfunctional macrophages laden with leishmania parasites. findings such as the ones we obtained allowed us to uncover the presence of patients with an atypical form of systemic leishmaniasis. it presents with symptoms masquarading a condition in which the immune system is non functional. this predisposes patients to recurrent secondary infections resulting in clinical pictures with a great variety of signs and symptoms. these findings alerted us to the fact that systemic leishmaniasis presents with a much wider spectrum of signs and symptoms than so far suspected and is far more common than diagnosed to date. furthermore, among these 31 patients was a number of adults. this proved that in our area systemic leishmaniasis is surely not limited to the pediatric age group. our recommendation is to entertain the diagnosis of atypical systemic leishmaniasis in any patient with an unexplained depressed immunity state and in whom no obvious immunologic defect can be identified. visceral leishmaniasis (vl) or kala-azar was first described by leishman in 1906. it is characterized by fever (periodic or continuous), cachexia, organomegaly (liver and spleen) causing the abdomen to protrude, severe wasting of the limbs and trunk, and pancytopenia [1] [4]. due to systemic parasite dissemination, the disease is in general fatal if untreated [5]. reviewing the literature, there seems to exist two types of systemic leishmaniasis. a form presenting with the above described signs and symptoms i. e. a classical form, and another type of the disorder referred to as the sub-clinical. the latter was first alluded to by leishman in 1906; then it was followed by several groups, starting from the late 1950s with manson-bahr [6], who recognized the presence of infected subjects carrying the parasite yet presenting with symptoms far milder. all of these studies were performed in endemic areas of the mediterranean basin.
the millions of mutations and polymorphisms that occur in human populations are potential predictors of disease, of our reactions to drugs, of predisposition to microbial infections, and of age-related conditions such as impaired brain and cardiovascular functions. however, predicting the phenotypic consequences and eventual clinical significance of a sequence variant is not an easy task. computational approaches have found perturbation of conserved amino acids to be a useful criterion for identifying variants likely to have phenotypic consequences. to our knowledge, however, no study to date has explored the potential of variants that occur at homologous positions within paralogous human proteins as a means of identifying polymorphisms with likely phenotypic consequences. in order to investigate the potential of this approach, we have assembled a unique collection of known disease-causing variants from omim and the human genome mutation database (hgmd) and used them to identify and characterize pairs of sequence variants that occur at homologous positions within paralogous human proteins. our analyses demonstrate that the locations of variants are correlated in paralogous proteins. moreover, if one member of a variant-pair is disease-causing, its partner is likely to be disease-causing as well. thus, information about variant-pairs can be used to identify potentially disease-causing variants, extend existing procedures for polymorphism prioritization, and provide a suite of candidates for further diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. the publicly available dbsnp database [1] contains approximately 12 million unique human sequence variants, few of which are associated with any particular phenotype or disease. large-scale association studies often produce hundreds of first hits in the form of individual snps or haplotypes that then need to be characterized for a potential role in a disease phenotype; see [2] [4]. currently, there exist few methods for prioritizing variations in a locus for use in association studies or to determine post-facto whether an association found in a genome wide association study is likely to hold up to further testing. the large number of uncharacterized snps has driven the development of computational methods aimed at identifying those variations likely to cause disease. to date, the most successful approaches to in silico snp characterization have been protein-based and comparative in nature, namely sift [5] [7] and polyphen [8] [9]. these approaches, often collectively referred to as amino acid substitution, or aas, approaches (for a review, see [4]), examine non-synonymous changes in human proteins in the context of multiple alignments of homologous proteins from other organisms. the assumption is that variants effecting amino acid replacements rarely seen in other species will be found in the human population.
within the human host, the malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum is exposed to multiple selection pressures. the host environment changes dramatically in severe malaria, but the extent to which the parasite responds to or is selected by this environment remains unclear. from previous studies, the parasites that cause severe malaria appear to increase expression of a restricted but poorly defined subset of the pfemp1 variant, surface antigens. pfemp1s are major targets of protective immunity. here, we used rna sequencing (rnaseq) to analyse gene expression in 44 parasite isolates that caused severe and uncomplicated malaria in papuan patients. the transcriptomes of 19 parasite isolates associated with severe malaria indicated that these parasites had decreased glycolysis without activation of compensatory pathways; altered chromatin structure and probably transcriptional regulation through decreased histone methylation; reduced surface expression of pfemp1; and down-regulated expression of multiple chaperone proteins. our rnaseq also identified novel associations between disease severity and pfemp1 transcripts, domains, and smaller sequence segments and also confirmed all previously reported associations between expressed pfemp1 sequences and severe disease. these findings will inform efforts to identify vaccine targets for severe malaria and also indicate how parasites adapt to or are selected by the host environment in severe malaria. p. falciparum is the leading cause of fatal malaria and is responsible for the death of over 400, 000 people annually, primarily in sub-saharan africa [1]. however, severe disease also occurs in southeast asia, and papua is the indonesian province with the highest prevalence of malaria [1]. severe malaria due to p. falciparum can manifest as multiple, diverse clinical syndromes [2], but a critical common feature is the sequestration of erythrocytes infected with mature parasites in the microvasculature (reviewed in [3]). comparative genome-wide analyses of parasite isolates that cause severe and uncomplicated malaria can be used to identify genes associated with parasite virulence and pathology. this knowledge could inform therapy and the design of vaccines targeting severe disease. although previous microarray studies of ring-stage and / or ex vivo cultivated mature parasites [4, 5] showed no differences between parasites causing severe and uncomplicated malaria, transcriptomic differences indicative of fundamental metabolic variations between clinical isolates have been reported. these differences were apparent in clinical isolates segregated by transcriptional profile alone [6] or by direct [7] or surrogate measures of parasitemia [8]. limitations of these studies included the need to cultivate the isolates prior to analysis, the absence of clinical severity phenotype [8], and the inability to directly compare severe and uncomplicated malaria in the same study population [7].
long-term delivery of potent broadly-neutralizing antibodies is a promising approach for the prevention of hiv-1 infection. we used aav vector intramuscularly to deliver anti-siv monoclonal antibodies (mabs) in igg1 form to rhesus monkeys. persisting levels of delivered mab as high as 270 μg / ml were achieved. however, host antibody responses to the delivered antibody were observed in 9 of the 12 monkeys and these appeared to limit the concentration of delivered antibody that could be achieved. this is reflected in the wide range of delivered mab concentrations that were achieved: 1 270 μg / ml. following repeated, marginal dose, intravenous challenge with the difficult-to-neutralize sivmac239, the six monkeys in the aav-5l7 igg1 mab group showed clear protective effects despite the absence of detectable neutralizing activity against the challenge virus. the protective effects included: lowering of viral load at peak height; lowering of viral load at set point; delay in the time to peak viral load from the time of the infectious virus exposure. all of these effects were statistically significant. in addition, the monkey with the highest level of delivered 5l7 mab completely resisted six successive sivmac239 i. v. challenges, including a final challenge with a dose of 10 i. v. infectious units. our results demonstrate the continued promise of this approach for the prevention of hiv-1 infection in people. however, the problem of anti-antibody responses will need to be understood and overcome for the promise of this approach to be effectively realized. there are good reasons for believing that development of an effective preventive vaccine against hiv-1 is going to be a very difficult task. hiv-1 has evolved a variety of immune evasion strategies that allow continuous virus replication in the face of apparently strong host immune responses, both cellular and humoral [1, 2]. for a vaccine to be effective it will likely need to either completely block the initial infection or to provide immune responses that are more effective than those resulting from infection. one promising, creative approach is to use adeno-associated virus (aav) vector to deliver antibodies with potent and broadly neutralizing activity [3 7]. this method is an alternative to classical immunization and independent of the host immune system. proteins delivered by aav vector can persist at stable levels for years [8, 9], and aav vectors have proven to be safe and effective in human gene therapy trials against a number of diseases [10 13]. more than a dozen potent broadly neutralizing anti-hiv-1 monoclonal antibodies have already been characterized; they are human monoclonal antibodies that have been shown to be highly effective in animal models of hiv infection [14].
the assumption of linear response of protein molecules to thermal noise or structural perturbations, such as ligand binding or detachment, is broadly used in the studies of protein dynamics. conformational motions in proteins are traditionally analyzed in terms of normal modes and experimental data on thermal fluctuations in such macromolecules is also usually interpreted in terms of the excitation of normal modes. we have chosen two important protein motors myosin v and kinesin kif1a and performed numerical investigations of their conformational relaxation properties within the coarse-grained elastic network approximation. we have found that the linearity assumption is deficient for ligand-induced conformational motions and can even be violated for characteristic thermal fluctuations. the deficiency is particularly pronounced in kif1a where the normal mode description fails completely in describing functional mechanochemical motions. these results indicate that important assumptions of the theory of protein dynamics may need to be reconsidered. neither a single normal mode nor a superposition of such modes yields an approximation of strongly nonlinear dynamics. protein machines, which may represent enzymes, ion pumps or molecular motors, play a fundamental role in biological cells and understanding of their activity is a major challenge. operation of these machines is based on slow conformational motions powered by external energy supply, often with ligands (such as atp). in molecular motors, binding of atp and its subsequent hydrolysis induce functional mechanochemical motions, essential for their operation. these motions, which follow after an energetic activation, are conformational relaxation processes. large-scale conformational changes may take place in proteins as a result of ligand binding [1]. despite the large magnitude of such changes, they are nonetheless often considered in the framework of the linear response theory [2] and the normal mode approximation [3] [7]. the normal mode analysis is furthermore broadly employed in the elastic-network studies of proteins [7] [18]. however, there is no general justification to assume that relaxation processes in proteins are linear and this assumption has to be verified for particular macromolecules. it is known that relaxation processes in complex dynamical systems may be strongly nonlinear and deviate much from simple exponential relaxation. as an example borrowed from a distant field, we can mention the belousov-zhabotinsky reaction which exhibits a great variety of spatiotemporal patterns (pacemakers, rotating spiral waves) that are however only complicated transients accompanying relaxation to the equilibrium state [19], [20]. conformational relaxation in single protein molecules may also be a complicated process, comprising qualitatively different kinds of mechanochemical motions. while partial unfolding and refolding, associated with ligand binding, are known for some protein machines, such as kinesin and myosin v, we have not found any evidence for such a process in the present study.
several studies have suggested crosstalk between different clathrin-independent endocytic pathways. however, the molecular mechanisms and functional relevance of these interactions are unclear. caveolins and cavins are crucial components of caveolae, specialized microdomains that also constitute an endocytic route. here we show that specific caveolar proteins are independently acting negative regulators of clathrin-independent endocytosis. cavin-1 and cavin-3, but not cavin-2 or cavin-4, are potent inhibitors of the clathrin-independent carriers / gpi-ap enriched early endosomal compartment (clic / geec) endocytic pathway, in a process independent of caveola formation. caveolin-1 (cav1) and cav3 also inhibit the clic / geec pathway upon over-expression. expression of caveolar protein leads to reduction in formation of early clic / geec carriers, as detected by quantitative electron microscopy analysis. furthermore, the clic / geec pathway is upregulated in cells lacking cav1 / cavin-1 or with reduced expression of cavin-1 and cavin-3. inhibition by caveolins can be mimicked by the isolated caveolin scaffolding domain and is associated with perturbed diffusion of lipid microdomain components, as revealed by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (frap) studies. in the absence of cavins (and caveolae) cav1 is itself endocytosed preferentially through the clic / geec pathway, but the pathway loses polarization and sorting attributes with consequences for membrane dynamics and endocytic polarization in migrating cells and adult muscle tissue. we also found that noncaveolar cavin-1 can act as a modulator for the activity of the key regulator of the clic / geec pathway, cdc42. this work provides new insights into the regulation of noncaveolar clathrin-independent endocytosis by specific caveolar proteins, illustrating multiple levels of crosstalk between these pathways. we show for the first time a role for specific cavins in regulating the clic / geec pathway, provide a new tool to study this pathway, identify caveola-independent functions of the cavins and propose a novel mechanism for inhibition of the clic / geec pathway by caveolin. endocytosis encompasses a number of distinct internalization pathways with clathrin-mediated endocytosis (cme) of receptors and their bound ligands being the best understood [1] [7]. caveolae, cup-shaped invaginations of the cell surface, have also received much attention as endocytic vehicles [8] [10]. however, the contribution to cellular endocytic uptake may vary greatly between cell types, depending on the nature of the endocytic cargo.
two-component signaling systems are ubiquitous in bacteria, archaea and plants and play important roles in sensing and responding to environmental stimuli. to propagate a signaling response the typical system employs a sensory histidine kinase that phosphorylates a receiver (rec) domain on a conserved aspartate (asp) residue. although it is known that some rec domains are missing this asp residue, it remains unclear as to how many of these divergent rec domains exist, what their functional roles are and how they are regulated in the absence of the conserved asp. here we have compiled all deposited rec domains missing their phosphorylatable asp residue, renamed here as the aspartate-less receiver (alr) domains. our data show that alrs are surprisingly common and are enriched for when attached to more rare effector outputs. analysis of our informatics and the available alr atomic structures, combined with structural, biochemical and genetic data of the alr archetype ritr from streptococcus pneumoniae presented here suggest that alrs have reorganized their active pockets to instead take on a constitutive regulatory role or accommodate input signals other than asp phosphorylation, while largely retaining the canonical post-phosphorylation mechanisms and dimeric interface. this work defines alrs as an atypical rec subclass and provides insights into shared mechanisms of activation between alr and rec domains. in a changing environment organisms must have means to effectively respond to external stimuli or perish. in bacteria, although so-called one-component signaling systems numerically dominate microbial genomes [1], two-component signaling (tcs) systems also play crucial roles in adaptation to the changing external environment [2, 3]. classical tcs systems consist of a membrane-bound histidine kinase that upon sensing an external stimulus, autophosphorylates using atp as a phosphate donor and then subsequently transfers the phosphate to a conserved asp residue within a cognate receiver (rec) domain-containing partner in the cytoplasm. rec domains adopt the flavodoxin fold, a very common (α / β) 5 architecture with a central 5-parallell β-sheet. the typical rec active pocket structure consists of an acidic triad that includes the phospho-accepting asp residue at the end of the β3 strand and two other acidic amino acids within the β1-α1 loop, an invariant lysine (lys) residue at the end of the β5 strand and a metal ion (usually mg2 +) that are coordinated through hydrogen bonding [4]. crystalline and solution structure comparisons of inactive (unphosphorylated) and active (phosphorylated) rec states have revealed that the phosphoryl group of the asp residue in the rec domain is buried within the active pocket and is not accessible to the solvent.
oncolytic herpes simplex viruses (ohsvs) showed efficacy in clinical trials and practice. most of them gain cancer-specificity from deletions / mutations in genes that counteract the host response, and grow selectively in cancer cells defective in anti-viral response. because of the deletions / mutations, they are frequently attenuated or over-attenuated. we developed next-generation ohsvs, which carry no deletion / mutation, gain cancer-specificity from specific retargeting to tumor cell receptors e. g. her2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2) hence are fully-virulent in the targeted cancer cells. the type of immunotherapy they elicit was not predictable, since non-attenuated hsvs induce and then dampen the innate response, whereas deleted / attenuated viruses fail to contrast it, and since the retargeted ohsvs replicate efficiently in tumor cells, but spare other cells in the tumor. we report on the first efficacy study of her2-retargeted, fully-virulent ohsvs in immunocompetent mice. their safety profile was very high. both the unarmed r-lm113 and the il-12-armed r-115 inhibited the growth of the primary her2-lewis lung carcinoma-1 (her2-llc1) tumor, r-115 being constantly more efficacious. all the mice that did not die because of the primary treated tumors, were protected from the growth of contralateral untreated tumors. the long-term survivors were protected from a second contralateral tumor, providing additional evidence for an abscopal immunotherapeutic effect. analysis of the local response highlighted that particularly r-115 unleashed the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, i. e. induced immunomodulatory cytokines, including ifnγ, t-bet which promoted th1 polarization. some of the tumor infiltrating cells, e. g. cd4 +, cd335 + cells were increased in the tumors of all responders mice, irrespective of which virus was employed, whereas cd8 +, foxp3 +, cd141 + were increased and cd11b + cells were decreased preferentially in r-115-treated mice. the durable response included a breakage of tolerance towards both her2 and the wt tumor cells, and underscored a systemic immunotherapeutic vaccine response. oncolytic viruses (ovs) meet the need for novel anticancer agents characterized by low toxicity and low negative impact on the quality of life of patients [1 4]. oncolytic herpes simplex viruses (ohsvs) stand for their efficacy in a number of clinical applications [5, 6]. the most successful ohsv, oncovexgm-csf, has been approved by the us food and drug administration (fda) for the treatment of recurrent glioblastoma multiforme (gbm).
the concerns raised from adenovirus 5 (ad5) -based hiv vaccine clinical trials, where excess hiv infections were observed in some vaccine recipients, have highlighted the importance of understanding host responses to vaccine vectors and the hiv susceptibility of vector-specific cd4 t cells in hiv vaccination. our recent study reported that human ad5-specific cd4 t cells induced by ad5 vaccination (rv156a trial) are susceptible to hiv. here we further investigated the hiv susceptibility of vector-specific cd4 t cells induced by alvac, a canarypox viral vector tested in the thai trial rv144, as compared to ad5 vector-specific cd4 t cells in the hvtn204 trial. we showed that while ad5 vector-specific cd4 t cells were readily susceptible to hiv, alvac-specific cd4 t cells in rv144 pbmc were substantially less susceptible to both r5 and x4 hiv in vitro. the lower hiv susceptibility of alvac-specific cd4 t cells was associated with the reduced surface expression of hiv entry co-receptors ccr5 and cxcr4 on these cells. phenotypic analyses identified that alvac-specific cd4 t cells displayed a strong th1 phenotype, producing higher levels of ifn-γ and ccl4 (mip-1β) but little il-17. of interest, alvac and ad5 vectors induced distinct profiles of vector-specific cd8 vs. cd4 t-cell proliferative responses in pbmc, with alvac preferentially inducing cd8 t-cell proliferation, while ad5 vector induced cd4 t-cell proliferation. depletion of alvac-, but not ad5-, induced cd8 t cells in pbmc led to a modest increase in hiv infection of vector-specific cd4 t cells, suggesting a role of alvac-specific cd8 t cells in protecting alvac-specific cd4 t cells from hiv. taken together, our data provide strong evidence for distinct hiv susceptibility of cd4 t cells induced by different vaccine vectors and highlight the importance of better evaluating anti-vector responses in hiv vaccination. over 30 years after the discovery of hiv as the causative agent of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (aids), hiv / aids continues to be a significant challenge for global public health. more than 36 million people are currently living with hiv, with over 2 million new infections and 1 million aids-related deaths per year [1]. development of a safe and effective hiv vaccine remains a high research priority. recombinant viral vectors are an important platform for hiv vaccine development. to date, a number of hiv vaccine vectors derived from different viral families have been developed, including adenovirus [2] and poxvirus [3, 4]. several clinical trials (step and ph.d.) have demonstrated the safety and immunogenicity of these vectors [5-7].
x inactivation the transcriptional silencing of one x chromosome copy per female somatic cell is universal among therian mammals, yet the choice of which x to silence exhibits considerable variation among species. x inactivation strategies can range from strict paternally inherited x inactivation (pxi), which renders females haploid for all maternally inherited alleles, to unbiased random x inactivation (rxi), which equalizes expression of maternally and paternally inherited alleles in each female tissue. however, the underlying evolutionary processes that might account for this observed diversity of x inactivation strategies remain unclear. we present a theoretical population genetic analysis of x inactivation evolution and specifically consider how conditions of dominance, linkage, recombination, and sex-differential selection each influence evolutionary trajectories of x inactivation. the results indicate that a single, critical interaction between allelic dominance and sex-differential selection can select for a broad and continuous range of x inactivation strategies, including unequal rates of inactivation between maternally and paternally inherited x chromosomes. rxi is favored over complete pxi as long as alleles deleterious to female fitness are sufficiently recessive, and the criteria for rxi evolution is considerably more restrictive when fitness variation is sexually antagonistic (i. e., alleles deleterious to females are beneficial to males) relative to variation that is deleterious to both sexes. evolutionary transitions from pxi to rxi also generally increase mean relative female fitness at the expense of decreased male fitness. these results provide a theoretical framework for predicting and interpreting the evolution of chromosome-wide expression of x-linked genes and lead to several useful predictions that could motivate future studies of allele-specific gene expression variation. mammalian females transcriptionally silence one of their two x chromosomes within each somatic cell a process called x inactivation [1], [2]. the basic phenomenon of x inactivation occurs in all therian (non egg-laying) mammals studied to date, yet the specific x chromosome silenced exhibits considerable diversity among species. at one extreme, typical of marsupials, the paternally inherited x is universally silenced and the maternally inherited x is ubiquitously expressed ([3], [4]; hereafter referred to as paternal x inactivation or pxi). in contrast, placental mammals practice random x inactivation (rxi): each somatic cell may express either the maternally or the paternally inherited x (the other x is silenced), and female bodies are composed of a mosaic of cells that individually express one of the two x chromosome copies [5]. while rxi is generally thought to be unbiased with each cell having an equal probability of expressing either of the two x chromosomes in this study, we show that rxi can be biased toward one x in a given somatic cell, depending on the relative fitness of the x chromosomes in the somatic cell and the sex of the female.
ccch-type zinc-finger antiviral protein (zap) is a host factor that restricts the infection of many viruses mainly through rna degradation, translation inhibition and innate immune responses. so far, only one flavivirus, yellow fever virus, has been reported to be zap-resistant. here, we investigated the antiviral potential of human zap (isoform zap-l and zap-s) against three flaviviruses, japanese encephalitis virus (jev), dengue virus (denv) and zika virus (zikv). infection of jev but not denv or zikv was blocked by zap overexpression, and depletion of endogenous zap enhanced jev replication. zap hampered jev translation and targeted viral rna for 3 ′ -5 ′ rna exosome-mediated degradation. the zinc-finger motifs of zap were essential for rna targeting and anti-jev activity. jev 3 ′ -utr, especially in the region with dumbbell structures and high content of cg dinucleotide, was mapped to bind zap and confer sensitivity to zap. in summary, we identified jev as the first zap-sensitive flavivirus. zap may act as an intrinsic antiviral factor through specific rna binding to fight against jev infection. zinc-finger ccch-type containing, antiviral 1 (zc3hav1) also known as zinc-finger antiviral protein (zap) was first discovered in rats as a host antiviral protein against moloney murine leukemia virus [1]. later, multiple rna and dna viruses, like retroviruses, filoviruses, alphaviruses, and hepatitis b virus were shown to display sensitivity to zap [2 6]. however, zap does not induce a universal antiviral state, since viruses such as herpes simplex virus 1 (hsv-1), vesicular stomatitis virus and yellow fever virus (yfv) are resistant to zap [4]. furthermore, viruses within the same family may exhibit different sensitivity to zap. for example, in the family picornaviridae, zap inhibited coxsackievirus b3 but not poliovirus infection [4, 7]. in humans, zap contains two major isoforms (zap-l and zap-s), which differ in the c-terminal region through alternative splicing [8]. in the n-terminus of zap, there are four ccch-type zinc-finger motifs, which are required for rna binding and antiviral property [9]. zap exhibits antiviral activity generally via posttranscriptional rna regulation, such as mrna decay and translation inhibition. zap is a potential antiviral factor against flaviviruses and other rna viruses.
rift valley fever virus (rvfv) is a major human and animal pathogen associated with severe disease including hemorrhagic fever or encephalitis. rvfv is endemic to parts of africa and the arabian peninsula, but there is significant concern regarding its introduction into non-endemic regions and the potentially devastating effect to livestock populations with concurrent infections of humans. to date, there is little detailed data directly comparing the host response to infection with wild-type or vaccine strains of rvfv and correlation with viral pathogenesis. here we characterized clinical and systemic immune responses to infection with wild-type strain zh501 or ind vaccine strain mp-12 in the c57bl / 6 mouse. animals infected with live-attenuated mp-12 survived productive viral infection with little evidence of clinical disease and minimal cytokine response in evaluated tissues. in contrast, zh501 infection was lethal, caused depletion of lymphocytes and platelets and elicited a strong, systemic cytokine response which correlated with high virus titers and significant tissue pathology. lymphopenia and platelet depletion were indicators of disease onset with indications of lymphocyte recovery correlating with increases in g-csf production. rvfv is hepatotropic and in these studies significant clinical and histological data supported these findings; however, significant evidence of a pro-inflammatory response in the liver was not apparent. rather, viral infection resulted in a chemokine response indicating infiltration of immunoreactive cells, such as neutrophils, which was supported by histological data. in brains of zh501 infected mice, a significant chemokine and pro-inflammatory cytokine response was evident, but with little pathology indicating meningoencephalitis. these data suggest that rvfv pathogenesis in mice is associated with a loss of liver function due to liver necrosis and hepatitis yet the long-term course of disease for those that might survive the initial hepatitis is neurologic in nature which is supported by observations of human disease and the balb / c mouse model. rift valley fever virus (rvfv) (family bunyaviridae, genus phlebovirus) is a highly pathogenic virus that can cause lethal disease in both humans and ruminant animals. rvfv is classified by the national institute for allergy and infectious diseases (niaid) as a category a priority pathogen and is a united states department of agriculture (usda) high priority pathogen. rvfv is historically endemic in sub-saharan africa, but recent outbreaks on the arabian peninsula have indicated an increased range for this virus. a recent outbreak in south africa (2010 may 2011) resulted in over 250 laboratory confirmed cases with an approximate case fatality rate of 11% [1]. rvfv is transmitted primarily by culicoides biting midges (diptera: ceratopogonidae).
chemotherapeutic resistance in triple-negative breast cancer (tnbc) has brought great challenges to the improvement of patient survival. the mechanisms of taxane chemoresistance in tnbc have not been well investigated. our results illustrated c-c motif chemokine ligand 20 (ccl20) was significantly elevated during taxane-containing chemotherapy in breast cancer patients with nonpathologic complete response. furthermore, ccl20 promoted the self-renewal and maintenance of breast cancer stem cells (bcscs) or breast cancer stem-like cells through protein kinase cζ (pkcζ) or p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (mapk) -mediated activation of p65 nuclear factor kappa b (nf-κb) pathway, significantly increasing the frequency and taxane resistance of bcscs. moreover, ccl20-promoted nf-κb activation increased atp-binding cassette subfamily b member 1 (abcb1) / multidrug resistance 1 (mdr1) expression, leading to the extracellular efflux of taxane. these results suggested that chemotherapy-induced ccl20 mediated chemoresistance via up-regulating abcb1. in addition, nf-κb activation increased ccl20 expression, forming a positive feedback loop between nf-κb and ccl20 pathways, which provides sustained impetus for chemoresistance in breast cancer cells. our results suggest that ccl20 can be a novel predictive marker for taxane response, and the blockade of ccl20 or its downstream pathway might reverse the taxane resistance in breast cancer patients. breast cancer is one of the most common cancers diagnosed among women, accounting for nearly 1 in 3 cancers [1]. the recurrence, metastasis, and drug resistance in the course of chemotherapy have brought great threat to breast cancer patients [2, 3], especially as chemoresistance limits the effectiveness of chemotherapeutic agents to a large extent. although the triple-negative breast cancers (tnbcs) are generally very susceptible to chemotherapy initially because of the highly proliferative capacity, early complete response (cr) does not correlate with overall survival (os) [4]. chemoresistance emerges during therapy because tumor cells are able to maintain viability following chemotherapeutic exposure via undergoing alternative cellular fates such as autophagy, cellular senescence, and therapeutic induced senescence (tis), although cytotoxic chemotherapy aims to kill cancer cells through apoptosis [5]. there are several specific ways to regulate chemoresistance of tnbc. regulation of atp-binding cassette (abc) transporters and β-tubulin iii subunit, disorder in enzymes critical in dna replication and repair, alterations in genes involved in apoptosis, and drug inactivation / detoxification and abnormal regulation of key signaling pathways such as aberrant activation of nuclear factor kappa b (nf-κb) or akt activity all participate in chemoresistance in tnbc [6].
toxoplasma gondii is an obligate intracellular parasite that can infect virtually all nucleated cells in warm-blooded animals. the ability of toxoplasma tachyzoites to infect and successfully manipulate its host is dependent on its ability to transport gra proteins that originate in unique secretory organelles called dense granules into the host cell in which they reside. gras have diverse roles in toxoplasma s intracellular lifecycle, including co-opting crucial host cell functions and proteins, such as the cell cycle, c-myc and p38 map kinase. some of these gra proteins, such as gra16 and gra24, are secreted into the parasitophorous vacuole (pv) within which toxoplasma replicates and are transported across the pv membrane (pvm) into the host cell, but the translocation process and its machinery are not well understood. we previously showed that tgmyr1, which is cleaved by tgasp5 into two fragments, localizes to the pvm and is essential for gra transport into the host cell. to identify additional proteins necessary for effector transport, we screened toxoplasma mutants defective in c-myc up-regulation for their ability to export gra16 and gra24 to the host cell nucleus. here we report that novel proteins myr2 and myr3 play a crucial role in translocation of a subset of gras into the host cell. myr2 and myr3 are secreted into the pv space and co-localize with pv membranes and myr1. consistent with their predicted transmembrane domains, all three proteins are membrane-associated, and myr3, but not myr2, stably associates with myr1, whose n- and c-terminal fragments are disulfide-linked. we further show that fusing intrinsically disordered effectors to a structured dhfr domain blocks the transport of other effectors, consistent with a translocon-based model of effector transport. overall, these results reveal a novel complex at the pvm that is essential for effector translocation into the host cell. toxoplasma gondii is an obligate intracellular parasite with an extraordinary host range: it can infect virtually any nucleated cell in almost any warm-blooded animal. upon infecting such a host, toxoplasma differentiates into tachyzoites that rapidly disseminate throughout host tissues [1]. when a tachyzoite invades a host cell, it invaginates the host plasma membrane to form the parasitophorous vacuole (pv), within which it replicates during its intracellular cycle [2]. although the vacuole protects toxoplasma from clearance by the innate immune system [3, 4], it also creates a barrier that the parasite must circumvent in order to successfully infect a new host.
the origin recognition complex (orc) coordinates a series of events that lead to initiation of dna strand duplication. as a nuclear double stranded dna plasmid, the papillomavirus (pv) genome resembles a mini-chromosome in infected cells. to initiate its replication, the viral e2 protein binds to and recruits the e1 dna helicase at the viral origin. pv genome replication program exhibits three stages: initial amplification from a single genome upon infection to a few copies per cell, a cell cycle linked maintenance phase, and a differentiation dependent late stage where the genome is amplified to thousands of copies. involvement of orc or other pre-replication complex (pre-rc) factors has not been described. we report that human pv (hpv) and bovine pv (bpv-1) e2 proteins bind to orc2, however, orc2 was not detected at the viral origin. depletion of orc2 enhanced pv replication in a transient replication model and in keratinocytes stably maintaining viral episomes, while there was no effect on copy number in a cell line with integrated hpv genomes. consistent with this, occupancy of e1 and e2 at the viral origin increased following orc2 silencing. these data imply that orc2 is not necessary for activation of the pv origin by e1 and e2 but instead suppresses e2 replicative function. furthermore, we observed that over-expression of hpv e2 decreased orc2 occupation at two known mammalian origins of replication, suggesting that e2 restricts pre-orc assembly that could otherwise compete for host replication complexes necessary for viral genome amplification. we infer that the orc2 complex with e2 restricts viral replication in the maintenance phase of the viral replication program and that elevated levels of e2 that occur during the differentiation dependent amplification stage subvert orc loading and hence dna synthesis at cellular origins. papillomaviruses (pv) are medically important pathogens especially as specific genotypes carry a high risk of progression to cancer, most commonly of the uterine cervix and oropharynx. because pvs have limited protein coding capacity in their typically 8 kilobases (kb) genome, these viruses do not encode a dna polymerase and must rely on host dna replication factors. the viral genome replicates and is maintained as circular covalently closed double stranded, histone coated dna plasmids in infected cells, thus resembling multi-copy mini-chromosomes. the viral genome replicative program consists of three stages [1, 2]. upon virus infection, its genome enters the nucleus of basal level epithelial cells and establishes a low copy number (1 to perhaps 50). in the second maintenance stage, these episomes duplicate as host epithelial cells replicate and depart the basal cell and suprabasal layers of the epithelium.
brucellosis is one of the most common zoonoses globally, and central asia remains a brucella hotspot. the world health organization classifies brucellosis as a neglected zoonotic disease that is rarely in the spotlight for research and mainly affects poor, marginalized people. urban and peri-urban farming is a common practice in many low-income countries, and it increases the incomes of families that are often restrained by limited economic resources. however, there is a concern that the growing number of people and livestock living close together in these areas will increase the transmission of zoonotic pathogens such as brucella. this study investigates the presence of brucella dna in bovine milk in the urban and peri-urban area of dushanbe, tajikistan. brucella dna was detected in 10. 3% of 564 cow milk samples by is711-based real-time pcr. this finding is concerning because consumption of unpasteurized dairy products is common in the region. furthermore, brucella dna was detected in the milk of all seropositive cows, but 8. 3% of the seronegative cows also showed the presence of brucella dna. in addition, sequence analysis of the rpob gene suggests that one cow was infected with b. abortus and another cow was most likely infected with b. melitensis. the discrepancies between the serology and real-time pcr results highlight the need to further investigate whether there is a need for implementing complementary diagnostic strategies to detect false serological negative individuals in brucella surveillance, control, and eradication programmes. furthermore, vaccination of cattle with s19 in addition to vaccination of small ruminants with rev 1 might be needed in order to control brucella infections in the livestock population but further research focusing on the isolation of brucella is required to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the brucella spp. circulating among the livestock in this region. brucellosis is considered to be one of the most common zoonotic infections worldwide with major public health implications [1], but it is still classified as one of seven neglected zoonotic diseases by the world health organization (who) [2]. the global incidence of human brucellosis is estimated to exceed 800, 000 cases per year, of which 40% are estimated to result in a chronic infection [3]. central asia and the middle east are areas with high incidence rates among humans and livestock. deregulations of trade and decreased border controls following political changes in post-communist countries are believed to be one set of explanations as to why central asia is currently a hotspot for brucellosis [4]. one of the most powerful megatrends of our time, in asia as well as in the rest of the world, has been the rapid expansion of pastoralism, which has led to the emergence and re-emergence of brucellosis.
chromosome and genome stability are important for normal cell function as instability often correlates with disease and dysfunction of dna repair mechanisms. many organisms maintain supernumerary or accessory chromosomes that deviate from standard chromosomes. the pathogenic fungus zymoseptoria tritici has as many as eight accessory chromosomes, which are highly unstable during meiosis and mitosis, transcriptionally repressed, show enrichment of repetitive elements, and enrichment with heterochromatic histone methylation marks, e. g., trimethylation of h3 lysine 9 or lysine 27 (h3k9me3, h3k27me3). to elucidate the role of heterochromatin on genome stability in z. tritici, we deleted the genes encoding the methyltransferases responsible for h3k9me3 and h3k27me3, kmt1 and kmt6, respectively, and generated a double mutant. we combined experimental evolution and genomic analyses to determine the impact of these deletions on chromosome and genome stability, both in vitro and in planta. we used whole genome sequencing, chip-seq, and rna-seq to compare changes in genome and chromatin structure, and differences in gene expression between mutant and wildtype strains. analyses of genome and chip-seq data in h3k9me3-deficient strains revealed dramatic chromatin reorganization, where h3k27me3 is mostly relocalized into regions that are enriched with h3k9me3 in wild type. many genome rearrangements and formation of new chromosomes were found in the absence of h3k9me3, accompanied by activation of transposable elements. in stark contrast, loss of h3k27me3 actually increased the stability of accessory chromosomes under normal growth conditions in vitro, even without large scale changes in gene activity. we conclude that h3k9me3 is important for the maintenance of genome stability because it disallows h3k27me3 in regions considered constitutive heterochromatin. in this system, h3k27me3 reduces the overall stability of accessory chromosomes, generating a metastable state for these quasi-essential regions of the genome. chromatin structure plays an important role in genome organization and gene expression [1 3]. a well-studied hallmark of epigenetic regulation is the reversible modification of histone tails, which can alter chromatin structure [4]. chromatin structure determines accessibility of the underlying dna to regulatory elements, whereby tightly packed dna, known as heterochromatin, is less accessible for dna binding proteins and usually shows little transcriptional activity [5]. heterochromatic regions often cluster together and are spatially separated from more transcriptionally active and accessible euchromatic regions [6]. specific histone modifications are associated with either heterochromatic or euchromatic regions. some of the most studied histone modifications are histone h3 lysine 9 di- or trimethylation (h3k9me2 / 3) [7] and h3 lysine 27 monomethylation (h3k27me1).
prompt post-exposure prophylaxis (pep) is essential in preventing the fatal onset of disease in persons exposed to rabies. unfortunately, life-saving rabies vaccines and biologicals are often neither accessible nor affordable, particularly to the poorest sectors of society who are most at risk and upon whom the largest burden of rabies falls. increasing accessibility, reducing costs and preventing delays in delivery of pep should therefore be prioritized. we analyzed different pep vaccination regimens and evaluated their relative costs and benefits to bite victims and healthcare providers. we found pep vaccination to be an extremely cost-effective intervention (from $200 to less than $60 / death averted). switching from intramuscular (im) administration of pep to equally efficacious intradermal (id) regimens was shown to result in significant savings in the volume of vaccine required to treat the same number of patients, which could mitigate vaccine shortages, and would dramatically reduce the costs of implementing pep. we present financing mechanisms that would make pep more affordable and accessible, could help subsidize the cost for those most in need, and could even support new and existing rabies control and prevention programs. we conclude that a universal switch to id delivery would improve the affordability and accessibility of pep for bite victims, leading to a likely reduction in human rabies deaths, as well as being economical for healthcare providers. rabies is invariably fatal once clinical signs appear but can be readily prevented after exposure with prompt and appropriate post-exposure prophylaxis (pep) [1]. pep is therefore the most critical life-saving intervention essential for the prevention of rabies in humans after exposure [2]. in reality, most of the estimated 7 million people exposed to rabies each year live in resource poor countries where life-saving rabies vaccines are not always available or easily affordable [3], [4], [5], [6]. this stark situation contributes to the fact that almost all of the estimated 55, 000 annual human rabies deaths occur in africa and asia where the virus circulates endemically in domestic dog populations [7]. the who-recommended pep protocol includes immediate wound washing, expeditious administration of rabies vaccine, and for severe categories of exposure, infiltration of purified rabies immunoglobulin (rig) in and around the wound [8]. rig is rarely administered in low-income countries because it is expensive (from usd $25 to over usd $200 depending on whether it is of equine or human origin) [7], [9] and in short supply (see the following examples: [3], [4], [5, 6]).

toxoplasma is an obligate intracellular parasite that replicates in mammalian cells within a parasitophorous vacuole (pv) that does not fuse with any host organelles. one mechanism developed by the parasite for nutrient acquisition is the attraction of host organelles to the pv. here, we examined the exploitation of host lipid droplets (ld), ubiquitous fat storage organelles, by toxoplasma. we show that toxoplasma replication is reduced in host cells that are depleted of ld, or impaired in tag lipolysis or fatty acid catabolism. in infected cells, the number of host ld and the expression of host ld-associated genes (adrp, dgat2), progressively increase until the onset of parasite replication. throughout infection, the pv are surrounded by host ld. toxoplasma is capable of accessing lipids stored in host ld and incorporates these lipids into its own membranes and ld. exogenous addition of oleic acid stimulates ld biogenesis in the host cell and results in the overaccumulation of neutral lipids in very large ld inside the parasite. to access ld-derived lipids, toxoplasma intercepts and internalizes within the pv host ld, some of which remaining associated with rab7, which become wrapped by an intravacuolar network of membranes (ivn). mutant parasites impaired in ivn formation display diminished capacity of lipid uptake from host ld. moreover, parasites lacking an ivn-localized phospholipase a2 are less proficient in salvaging lipids from host ld in the pv, suggesting a major contribution of the ivn for host ld processing in the pv and, thus lipid content release. interestingly, gavage of parasites with lipids unveils, for the first time, the presence in toxoplasma of endocytic-like structures containing lipidic material originating from the pv lumen. this study highlights the reliance of toxoplasma on host ld for its intracellular development and the parasite s capability in scavenging neutral lipids from host ld. in mammalian cells, lipid droplets (ld) are cytoplasmic structures containing a diverse array of lipids and proteins. ld consist of an organic core, comprising neutral lipids (mostly triacylglycerols (tag) and cholesteryl esters (ce) with mixed fatty acid composition) bounded by a monolayer of phospholipids [1]. inserted onto the outer phospholipid monolayer are structural proteins (e. g., proteins of the perilipin family, such as adipose differentiation-related protein (adrp) or adipophilin), lipid biosynthetic enzymes (e. g., acyl-coa: diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 (dgat2), and acyl-coa synthetase), lipolytic enzymes (e. g., adipose tissue triacylglycerol lipase (atgl) and membrane-trafficking proteins such as perilipin-1 (plin1)), as well as proteins involved in membrane trafficking (e.g., rab7) [2].
increased reports of human infections have led fasciolosis, a widespread disease of cattle and sheep caused by the liver flukes fasciola hepatica and fasciola gigantica, to be considered an emerging zoonotic disease. chemotherapy is the main control measure available, and triclabendazole is the preferred drug since is effective against both juvenile and mature parasites. however, resistance to triclabendazole has been reported in several countries urging the search of new chemical entities and target molecules to control fluke infections. we searched a library of forty flavonoid derivatives for inhibitors of key stage specific fasciola hepatica cysteine proteases (fhcl3 and fhcl1). chalcones substituted with phenyl and naphtyl groups emerged as good cathepsin l inhibitors, interacting more frequently with two putative binding sites within the active site cleft of the enzymes. one of the compounds, c34, tightly bounds to juvenile specific fhcl3 with an ic50 of 5. 6 μm. we demonstrated that c34 is a slow-reversible inhibitor that interacts with the cys-his catalytic dyad and key s2 and s3 pocket residues, determinants of the substrate specificity of this family of cysteine proteases. interestingly, c34 induces a reduction in nej ability to migrate through the gut wall and a loss of motility phenotype that leads to nej death within a week in vitro, while it is not cytotoxic to bovine cells. up to date there are no reports of in vitro screening for non-peptidic inhibitors of fasciola hepatica cathepsins, while in general these are considered as the best strategy for in vivo inhibition. we have identified chalcones as novel inhibitors of the two main cathepsins secreted by juvenile and adult liver flukes. interestingly, one compound (c34) is highly active towards the juvenile enzyme reducing larval ability to penetrate the gut wall and decreasing nej s viability in vitro. these findings open new avenues for the development of novel agents to control fluke infection and possibly other helminthic diseases. parasitic flatworms are the causative agents of serious human and livestock infections many of which have been considered neglected tropical diseases in urgent need for research efforts. liver flukes (fasciola spp.) cause fasciolosis, traditionally a relevant disease of cattle, sheep and goats [1], currently considered an emerging zoonotic disease by the world health organization due to an increased incidence of human infections [2]. despite many efforts to develop a vaccine to prevent mammalian infection [3], chemotherapy is the only fasciola control mechanism currently available. triclabendazole is the first choice drug since it is highly effective against all stages of the parasite and is well tolerated by humans [4].
the visual system transmits information about fast and slow changes in light intensity through separate neural pathways. we used in vivo imaging to investigate how bipolar cells transmit these signals to the inner retina. we found that the volume of the synaptic terminal is an intrinsic property that contributes to different temporal filters. individual cells transmit through multiple terminals varying in size, but smaller terminals generate faster and larger calcium transients to trigger vesicle release with higher initial gain, followed by more profound adaptation. smaller terminals transmitted higher stimulus frequencies more effectively. modeling global calcium dynamics triggering vesicle release indicated that variations in the volume of presynaptic compartments contribute directly to all these differences in response dynamics. these results indicate how one neuron can transmit different temporal components in the visual signal through synaptic terminals of varying geometries with different adaptational properties. the retina analyzes the visual world through a series of spatio-temporal filters that establish parallel representations for transmission to the brain [1] [4]. the anatomical organization of these channels is established in the inner plexiform layer (ipl), which is organized into five to six distinct strata containing the dendrites of as many as 20 different types of retinal ganglion cell (rgc) [2]. in each stratum, bipolar cells (bcs) with distinct filtering properties make excitatory synaptic connections with defined subsets of rgcs [5]. for instance, transient rgcs are thought to receive excitatory inputs from bcs with bandpass characteristics, while sustained rgcs receive inputs from bcs acting as low-pass filters [6]. a long-standing question is how multiple spatio-temporal filters are built using the limited numbers of neurons responding to a particular region of the visual field [7] [9]. an answer might lie in reconsidering the fundamental neural element through which the visual signal is transmitted to the inner retina: although individual bcs have diverse properties, their output is transmitted through a much more numerous and heterogeneous component of neural circuits synapses [10]. indeed, recent evidence indicates that different synapses of the same bc transmit the visual signal with varying kinetics because of local interactions with different types of inhibitory amacrine cells [11]. here we ask whether heterogeneous transmission of the visual signal might also reflect intrinsic variations between the various synaptic compartments of a bc. the property we concentrate on is the volume of the terminal, which is expected to influence the amplitude and kinetics of the presynaptic calcium signal controlling neurotransmission [12]. to observe the activity of multiple bc synapses we used zebrafish expressing fluorescent proteins reporting the fusion of synaptic vesicles or the presynaptic calcium signal driving fusion [13], [14].
deeper exploration of the brain s vast synaptic networks will require new tools for high-throughput structural and molecular profiling of the diverse populations of synapses that compose those networks. fluorescence microscopy (fm) and electron microscopy (em) offer complementary advantages and disadvantages for single-synapse analysis. fm combines exquisite molecular discrimination capacities with high speed and low cost, but rigorous discrimination between synaptic and non-synaptic fluorescence signals is challenging. in contrast, em remains the gold standard for reliable identification of a synapse, but offers only limited molecular discrimination and is slow and costly. to develop and test single-synapse image analysis methods, we have used datasets from conjugate array tomography (cat), which provides voxel-conjugate fm and em (annotated) images of the same individual synapses. we report a novel unsupervised probabilistic method for detection of synapses from multiplex fm (muxfm) image data, and evaluate this method both by comparison to em gold standard annotated data and by examining its capacity to reproduce known important features of cortical synapse distributions. the proposed probabilistic model-based synapse detector accepts molecular-morphological synapse models as user queries, and delivers a volumetric map of the probability that each voxel represents part of a synapse. taking human annotation of cat em data as ground truth, we show that our algorithm detects synapses from muxfm data alone as successfully as human annotators seeing only the muxfm data, and accurately reproduces known architectural features of cortical synapse distributions. this approach opens the door to data-driven discovery of new synapse types and their density. we suggest that our probabilistic synapse detector will also be useful for analysis of standard confocal and super-resolution fm images, where em cross-validation is not practical. deeper understanding of the basic mechanisms and pathologies of the brain s synaptic networks will require advances in our quantitative understanding of structural, molecular, and functional diversity within the vast populations of individual synapses that define those networks [1] [2] [3] [4]. regardless of the subject of interest, synapse heterogeneity makes assay at the single-synapse level paramount. here, we introduce and characterize a novel image analysis method for automated detection and molecular measurement of individual synapses and single-synapse molecular profiling of diverse synapse populations from multiplex fluorescence microscopy (muxfm) image data. the proposed methodology for structural identification and molecular analysis of single synapses at scale will be an enabling step toward deeper experimental analysis of the relationships between synaptic structure, molecules, and function. reliable, high-throughput methods for large-scale synapse detection will also help to analyze volume-based data sets of single-synapses, such as single-cell rna-sequencing (scrna-seq) data, which are increasingly being used in neuroscience.
zinc is a vital trace element crucial for the proper function of some 3, 000 cellular proteins. specifically, zinc is essential for key physiological processes including nucleic acid metabolism, regulation of gene expression, signal transduction, cell division, immune- and nervous system functions, wound healing, and apoptosis. consequently, impairment of zinc homeostasis disrupts key cellular functions resulting in various human pathologies. mammalian zinc transport proceeds via two transporter families znt and zip. however, the detailed mechanism of action of znt2, which is responsible for vesicular zinc accumulation and zinc secretion into breast milk during lactation, is currently unknown. moreover, although the putative coupling of zinc transport to the proton gradient in acidic vesicles has been suggested, it has not been conclusively established. herein we modeled the mechanism of action of znt2 and demonstrated both computationally and experimentally, using functional zinc transport assays, that znt2 is indeed a proton-coupled zinc antiporter. bafilomycin a1, a specific inhibitor of vacuolar-type proton atpase (v-atpase) which alkalizes acidic vesicles, abolished znt2-dependent zinc transport into intracellular vesicles. moreover, using lysotracker red and lyso-phluorin, we further showed that upon transient znt2 overexpression in intracellular vesicles and addition of exogenous zinc, the vesicular ph underwent alkalization, presumably due to a proton-zinc antiport; this phenomenon was reversed in the presence of tpen, a specific zinc chelator. finally, based on computational energy calculations, we propose that znt2 functions as an antiporter with a stoichiometry of 2h + / zn2 + ion. hence, znt2 is a proton motive force-driven, electroneutral vesicular zinc exchanger, concentrating zinc in acidic vesicles on the expense of proton extrusion to the cytoplasm. divalent zinc ions are key and integral components of a multitude of proteins involved in a plethora of essential physiological processes including metabolism of nucleic acids, regulation of gene expression, signal transduction, cell division, immune- and nervous-system functions, wound healing, as well as apoptosis [1 4]. as such, it is crucial for cells to be efficiently shuttle zinc to- and from their surroundings, between organelles and distinct compartments. mammalian zinc transporters belong to two families, znt and zip, canonically exporting and importing zinc, respectively. specifically, znt2 plays a crucial role in concentrating zinc within secretory vesicles which were suggested to release zinc into breast milk during lactation [5]. in fact, exclusively breastfed infants nursed by mothers harboring loss-of-function mutations in znt2 suffer from zinc deficiency [6].
replication fork integrity, which is essential for the maintenance of genome stability, is monitored by checkpoint-mediated phosphorylation events. 14-3-3 proteins are able to bind phosphorylated proteins and were shown to play an undefined role under dna replication stress. exonuclease 1 (exo1) processes stalled replication forks in checkpoint-defective yeast cells. we now identify 14-3-3 proteins as in vivo interaction partners of exo1, both in yeast and mammalian cells. yeast 14-3-3 deficient cells fail to induce mec1 dependent exo1 hyperphosphorylation and accumulate exo1 dependent ssdna gaps at stalled forks, as revealed by electron microscopy. this leads to persistent checkpoint activation and exacerbated recovery defects. moreover, using dna bi-dimensional electrophoresis, we show that 14-3-3 proteins promote fork progression under limiting nucleotide concentrations. we propose that 14-3-3 proteins assist in controlling the phosphorylation status of exo1 and additional unknown targets, promoting fork progression, stability, and restart in response to dna replication stress. dna lesions can cause stalling and collapse of the replication fork and lead to chromosome breaks, mutations, genome rearrangements and eventually cancer [1]. to prevent this, a replication checkpoint has evolved as surveillance mechanism to control components of the replisome [2] and to allow coordinating replication with cell cycle progression and dna repair. maintenance of stable replication intermediates when dna synthesis is impeded, requires replisome stability and checkpoint-dependent phosphorylation [3]. although crucial targets for this checkpoint function await identification, nuclease activities are particularly likely to require fine-tuning, to avoid unscheduled dna processing under dna replication stress [4]. exo1 is a rad2 family dna repair nuclease able to remove mononucleotides from the 5 ′ end of the dna duplex [5] that was originally identified in the schizosaccharomyces pombe [6] and subsequently in humans [7]. exo1 is implicated in several dna repair pathways including mismatch repair, post replication repair, meiotic and mitotic recombination and double strand break repair [8] [12]. saccharomyces cerevisiae exo1 acts redundantly with rad27 in processing okazaki fragments during dna replication [13]. more recently, exo1 was shown to be recruited to stalled replication forks where it counteracts fork reversal [4]. human exo1 activity is controlled by post-translational modifications, with atr-dependent phosphorylation targeting it to ubiquitin-mediated degradation upon replication fork stalling [14], [15], and atm-dependent and atr-independent phosphorylation of the c-terminal tail of the protein [16] [17].
