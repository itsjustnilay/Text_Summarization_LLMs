{"lay_summary": "The DNA in genes encodes the basic information needed to build an organism or control its day-to-day operations . Most cells in an organism contain the same genetic information , but different types of cell use the information differently . For example , many of the genes that are active in a muscle cell are different from those that are active in a skin cell . These different patterns of gene activation largely determine a cell\u2019s identity and are brought about by DNA-binding proteins or chemical modifications to the DNA ( which are both forms of so-called epigenetic regulation ) . Nevertheless , cells occasionally change their identities \u2013 a phenomenon that is referred to as reprograming . This process allows tissues to be regenerated after wounding , but , due to technical difficulties , reprograming has been often studied in isolated cells grown in a dish . Seelk , Adrian-Kalchhauser et al . set out to understand how being surrounded by intact tissue influences reprograming . The experiments made use of C . elegans worms , because disturbing how this worm\u2019s DNA is packaged can trigger its cells to undergo reprograming . Seelk , Adrian-Kalchhauser et al . show that a signaling pathway that is found in many different animals enhances this kind of reprograming in C . elegans . On the one hand , these findings help in understanding how epigenetic regulation can be altered by a specific tissue environment . On the other hand , the findings also suggest that abnormal signaling can result in altered epigenetic control of gene expression and lead to cells changing their identity . Indeed , increased signaling is linked to a major epigenetic mechanism seen in specific blood tumors , suggesting that the regulatory principles uncovered using this simple worm model could eventually provide insights into a human disease . A future challenge will be to determine precisely how the studied signaling pathway interacts with the epigenetic regulator that controls reprograming . Understanding this interaction in molecular detail could help to devise strategies for controlling reprograming . These strategies could in turn lead to treatments for people with conditions that cause specific cells types to be lost , such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease or injuries .", "article": "Cell-fate reprograming is at the heart of development , yet very little is known about the molecular mechanisms promoting or inhibiting reprograming in intact organisms . In the C . elegans germline , reprograming germ cells into somatic cells requires chromatin perturbation . Here , we describe that such reprograming is facilitated by GLP-1/Notch signaling pathway . This is surprising , since this pathway is best known for maintaining undifferentiated germline stem cells/progenitors . Through a combination of genetics , tissue-specific transcriptome analysis , and functional studies of candidate genes , we uncovered a possible explanation for this unexpected role of GLP-1/Notch . We propose that GLP-1/Notch promotes reprograming by activating specific genes , silenced by the Polycomb repressive complex 2 ( PRC2 ) , and identify the conserved histone demethylase UTX-1 as a crucial GLP-1/Notch target facilitating reprograming . These findings have wide implications , ranging from development to diseases associated with abnormal Notch signaling . \n Cell-fate decisions are controlled , on the one hand , by intercellular signaling and , on the other hand , by intrinsic mechanisms such as epigenetic chromatin modifications . The Notch signaling pathway is a highly conserved and widespread signaling mechanism ( Artavanis-Tsakonas et al . , 1999; Greenwald and Kovall , 2013 ) , which has been implicated in key cell-fate decisions such as the decision between proliferation and differentiation ( Liu et al . , 2010 ) . Notch signaling has also been implicated in cellular reprograming . Upon inhibition of Notch signaling , the oncogenic genes KLF4 and cMyc become dispensable for the generation of induced pluripotent stem cells ( iPSCs ) from mouse and human keratinocytes ( Ichida et al . , 2014 ) . In this setting , Notch inhibits reprograming . Conversely , Notch signaling promotes transdifferentiation of pancreatic acinar cells to ductal cells ( Sawey et al . , 2007 ) , or the conversion of hepatocytes into biliary cells in liver primary malignancy intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma ( ICC ) ( Sekiya and Suzuki , 2012 ) . Notch signaling can also affect reprograming in normal development . In C . elegans , signaling through the GLP-1 and LIN-12 Notch receptors impedes reprograming during embryogenesis and , during larval development , signaling through LIN-12 is required for the conversion of a rectal epithelial cell into a motorneuron ( Jarriault et al . , 2008; Djabrayan et al . , 2012 ) . The role of epigenetic regulators in cell-fate decisions has been studied mostly in pluripotent cells cultured outside of their normal tissue environment ( Meshorer and Misteli , 2006; Spivakov and Fisher , 2007; Lessard and Crabtree , 2010; Orkin and Hochedlinger , 2011 ) . Therefore , the\u00a0epigenetic regulation of stem cell identity in intact tissues remains poorly understood . Additionally , the impact of external cues , for example signaling from a stem cell niche to the recipient cell\u2019s chromatin remains equally unresolved . By contrast , C . elegans has been used as a model to study reprograming in an intact organism ( Horner et al . , 1998; Fukushige et al . , 1998; Zhu et al . , 1998; Fukushige and Krause , 2005; Ciosk et al . , 2006; Jarriault et al . , 2008; Yuzyuk et al . , 2009; Riddle et al . , 2013 ) . In this model , germ cells can be directly reprogrammed into neurons by depleting specific chromatin modifiers such as LIN-53 ( Rbbp4/7 ) or components of PRC2 , and by concomitant overexpression of the transcription factor CHE-1 , which induces glutamatergic neuronal fate in a process which we refer to as Germ cell Conversion ( GeCo ) ( Tursun et al . , 2011; Patel et al . , 2012 ) . Here , we identify the Notch signaling pathway as a critical player in this reprograming model . This was unanticipated , since signaling through the Notch receptor GLP-1 ( henceforth GLP-1Notch ) from the somatic gonadal niche is known to maintain germline stem cell/progenitor fate ( Kimble and Crittenden , 2007 ) . To understand this novel , reprograming-promoting role of GLP-1Notch , we combined genetics with tissue-specific expression profiling . We identified genes regulated by GLP-1Notch , including genes recently shown to maintain the germline stem/progenitor cells ( Kershner et al . , 2014 ) . Additionally , and unexpectedly , we found that many genes activated by GLP-1Notch signaling were also repressed by the cell fate-stabilizing chromatin regulator PRC2 . We show that GLP-1Notch and PRC2 have an antagonistic effect on germ cell-fate decisions and demonstrate co-regulation of their common target , utx-1 . Importantly , UTX-1 is a histone demethylase known to erase the gene-silencing methylation of histone H3 dependent on PRC2 ( Maures et al . , 2011; Jin et al . , 2011; Vandamme et al . , 2012 ) . Thus , we propose that the GLP-1Notch\u2013dependent induction of UTX-1 facilitates reprograming by alleviating PRC2-mediated repression of alternative cell fates . \n Germ cells can be converted into neuronal cells in intact C . elegans upon overexpression of the neuronal transcription factor CHE-1 , simply by depleting the chromatin modifier LIN-53 ( Tursun et al . , 2011; Patel et al . , 2012 ) . This GeCo phenotype can be followed in living animals by monitoring a reporter GFP expressed from the gcy-5 promoter , which otherwise is induced in glutamatergic ASE neurons ( Altun-Gultekin et al . , 2001 ) . In contrast to the spontaneous teratomatous differentiation of meiotic germ cells , observed in the absence of specific RNA-binding proteins ( Ciosk et al . , 2006; Biedermann et al . , 2009; Tocchini et al . , 2014 ) , GeCo is preferentially observed in the pre-meiotic , proliferating germ cells ( Tursun et al . , 2011; Patel et al . , 2012 ) . Consistently , removing the proliferating germ cells , by inhibiting GLP-1Notch signaling , prevents GeCo ( Tursun et al . , 2011 ) . However , because the proliferating germ cells were eliminated , these experiments did not address a possible direct effect of GLP-1Notch signaling on GeCo . We began addressing this issue by examining the gonads of animals carrying the gain-of-function glp-1 allele ( ar202 ) ( Pepper et al . , 2003 ) . These gonads are filled with proliferating germ cells and , upon depleting LIN-53 and overexpressing CHE-1 , we observed that significantly more germ cells converted to ASE neurons ( Figure 1A , Figure 1\u2014source data 1 ) . We refer to this enhanced GeCo as 'GeCo+' . Detailed quantification revealed that the GeCo+ gonads contained more than twice the number of converted cells ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A , Figure 1\u2014source data 1 ) . The nuclei of these converted cells were reminiscent of neuronal nuclei and the cells displayed axo-dendritic projection ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B ) , as previously described ( Tursun et al . , 2011; Patel et al . , 2012 ) . To confirm that the GeCo enhancement depends on the canonical Notch signaling pathway , rather than an independent function of the GLP-1Notch\u00a0receptor , we RNAi-depleted the transcriptional effector of GLP-1Notch signaling , LAG-1 ( Christensen et al . , 1996 ) . We exposed animals only after hatching to lag-1 RNAi in order to avoid sterility , which is caused when animals are subjected to lag-1 RNAi earlier ( Supplemental file 1 ) . RNAi-mediated knock-down of lag-1 strongly inhibited GeCo ( Figure 1B , Figure 1\u2014source data 1 ) . Importantly , under these experimental conditions , we did not observe any obvious reduction of germ cell numbers ( Figure 1C , Figure 1\u2014source data 1 ) , suggesting a proliferation-independent effect of GLP-1Notch signaling on cell-fate conversion . To investigate this further , we tested GeCo efficiency on germ cells proliferating independently of GLP-1Notch signaling . We took advantage of mutants in which , in the absence of two meiosis/differentiation-promoting factors GLD-1 and GLD-2 , germ cells proliferate independently of GLP-1Notch ( Kadyk and Kimble , 1998 ) . Specifically , we examined GeCo in the loss-of-function gld-1 ( q497 ) gld-2 ( q485 ) mutants , which carried either wild-type glp-1 or the loss-of-function glp-1 ( q175 ) allele ( Austin and Kimble , 1987 ) . Both mutant combinations have previously been described to have tumorous germlines and impaired meiotic entry ( Kadyk and Kimble , 1998; Hansen et al . , 2004 ) . In contrast to efficient GeCo observed in the gld-1 ( q497 ) gld-2 ( q485 ) gonads , GeCo was strongly diminished in the gld-1 ( q497 ) gld-2 ( q485 ) ; glp-1 ( q175 ) gonads , despite the ongoing germ cell proliferation ( Figure 1D , Figure 1\u2014source data 1 ) . Counting the number of germ cells in these gonads revealed only a slight difference ( a 15% increase in the numbers in the double vs . triple mutant gonads ) , suggesting that the strong enhancement of GeCo by GLP-1Notch signaling cannot be explained by the\u00a0increased number of germ cells ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2 , Figure 1\u2014source data 1 ) . Since it has been proposed that dividing cells have a higher propensity for cellular reprograming ( Egli et al . , 2008; Hanna et al . , 2009 ) , we also tested whether blocking the cell cycle would affect the observed GeCo enhancement in glp-1 ( gf ) gonads . As previously described ( Fox et al . , 2011; Patel et al . , 2012 ) , we used hydroxyurea ( HU ) treatment to block the cell cycle in the S phase . Blocking the cell cycle by HU did not diminish the GeCo+ phenotype ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3 , Figure 1\u2014source data 1 ) . Combined , these results suggest that GLP-1Notch enhances GeCo independently from its role in promoting germ cell proliferation . 10 . 7554/eLife . 15477 . 003Figure 1 .

( A ) For the quantification of gcy-5::gfp-positive cells per gonadal arm only the GeCo category of wt vs . glp-1 ( gf ) was used because GeCo+ animals already show an extensive area of the gonad filled with gcy-5::gfp-positive cells with usually >100 cells/gonad making reliable counting impossible . Notably , animals with a seemingly similar extend of GeCo in wt vs . glp-1 ( gf ) show a clear increase of gcy-5::gfp-positive cells per gonadal arm from approx . 10 in wt to > 30 in glp-1 ( gf ) . n ( wt ) = 75 gonaldal arms , n ( glp-1 ( ar202 ) ) = 221 gonadal arms . The background of the loss of function allele glp-1 ( q175 ) leads to a significant decrease in GeCo as shown previously ( Tursun et al . , 2011 ) .

Blocking the cell cycle with hydroxyurea does not inhibit GeCo+ . ( A ) We used hydroxyurea ( HU ) treatment for 5 hr to chemically block the cell cycle , which makes germ cells arrest in the S phase of the cell cycle . This arrest does not diminish the GeCo+ phenotype in glp-1 ( gf ) gonads upon lin-53 RNAi and che-1 ( oe ) . At least 150 animals were quantified per condition .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 15477 . 007 To understand the effects of GLP-1Notch on GeCo , we set out to identify genes regulated by GLP-1Notch signaling in germ cells . To conduct the\u00a0analysis in morphologically similar tissue , we again took advantage of the gld-1 gld-2 double mutants that , combined with either loss-of-function or gain-of-function glp-1 alleles , have morphologically similar gonads , filled with proliferating , undifferentiated germ cells ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1 ) ( Kadyk and Kimble , 1998; Hansen et al . , 2004 ) . We combined gld-1 ( q497 ) gld-2 ( q485 ) mutations with either the temperature-sensitive loss-of-function ( lf ) glp-1 allele ( e2144 ) , or the temperature-sensitive gain-of-function ( gf ) glp-1 allele ( ar202 ) ( Priess et al . , 1987; Pepper et al . , 2003 ) . Because GLD-1 and GLD-2 regulate gene expression at the posttranscriptional level only , we expected that transcriptionally regulated GLP-1Notch targets could be identified in this background . To analyze gene expression , gonads were dissected from animals grown at the restrictive temperature in two independent experiments , and transcripts were analyzed with tiling arrays ( GEO accession number GSE49395 ) . We identified around 100 transcripts that were differentially expressed between the gld-1 gld-2; glp-1 ( lf ) ( Notch OFF ) and gld-1 gld-2; glp-1 ( gf ) ( Notch ON ) gonads ( Figure 2A and Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2 , Figure 2\u2014source data 1 ) . These changes were confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR ( RT-qPCR ) on selected transcripts ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement2A , Figure 2\u2014source data 1 ) . Most differentially expressed transcripts were upregulated in the \u2018Notch ON\u2019 gonads , indicating a predominantly activating role of GLP-1Notch in germ cells . For simplicity , we will refer to the transcripts upregulated at least two fold in the Notch ON gonads as \u2018Notch\u2013activated\u2019 . Some Notch-activated genes , such as sel-8/Mastermind , lst-1 , and epn-1/Epsin , have been implicated in Notch signaling in other cell types ( Doyle et al . , 2000; Yoo , 2004; Tian et al . , 2004; Singh et al . , 2011; Kershner et al . , 2014 ) . However , it remains possible that , rather than being direct GLP-1Notch targets , some of the Notch-activated genes were upregulated as an indirect consequence of increased GLP-1Notch signaling . 10 . 7554/eLife . 15477 . 008Figure 2 . GLP-1Notch and PRC2 regulate common targets and are functionally connected . ( A ) Notch-activated genes are biased for the sex chromosome linkage . Left: Changes in transcript abundance in the \u2018Notch ON\u2019 versus \u2018OFF\u2019 dissected gonads ( genotypes explained in Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013B ) were analyzed by microarrays . Transcripts upregulated at least 2-fold in the \u2018Notch ON\u2019 gonads are marked in red , those downregulated at least 2-fold in blue . Selected transcripts verified by RT-qPCR in Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2A are additionally circled in black . Right: 5426 genes can be considered expressed in the gonad , based on the bimodal distribution of expression values . Only 3% of those expressed genes are X-linked . In contrast , nearly half ( 46% ) of the expressed and Notch-activated transcripts are X-linked ( see Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2B for numbers ) . ( B ) GLP-1Notch and PRC2 interact genetically . Left: DAPI-stained gonads from animals of the indicated genotypes . The mes-2 ( bn11 ) M+Z- single mutant gonads have wild-type appearance at 20\u00b0C . The glp-1 ( ar202 ) gain-of-function mutants have an almost wild-type appearance at this temperature , except for an extended proliferative zone in the gonad , referred to as 'distal tumor' . At the same temperature , mes-2 ( bn11 ) M+Z-; glp-1 ( ar202 ) double mutants developed germline tumors in 32/32 of the examined gonads . The insets show close-ups from the indicated gonadal regions: the distal-most regions contain undifferentiated , proliferative germ cells in all mutants ( a , c , e ) . However , while the single mutants contain oocytes with characteristically condensed chromosomes in the proximal gonads ( b , d ) , the proximal gonads of the double mutants harbor proliferative germ cells ( f ) . Scale bar = 30 \u03bcm . Right: quantification of the phenotypes . 'Distal tumor' indicates the presence of an elongated distal proliferative zone ( approximately \u00bd of the distal gonad arm ) . 'Extended' tumor indicates an extended distal tumor , few oocytes , and frequently also a proximal tumor . 'Fully tumorous' indicates the absence of all differentiated cell types except for sperm produced during larval development . ( C ) GLP-1Notch and PRC2 target the same genes on the X chromosomes . The plots correlate changes in gene expression in M+Z- mes-2 mutants with changes in gene expression changes in M+Z- mes-6 mutants . Results are shown separately for X-linked ( left ) and autosomal ( right ) transcripts . Notch-activated genes ( red in Figure 2A ) are marked in red . Lightly shaded areas indicate transcripts that are at least 2-fold upregulated . The overlap between transcripts upregulated by GLP-1Notch and transcripts upregulated by the loss of CePRC2 is highly significant , particularly for the X-linked genes . The significance of the correlation was measured by hypergeometric distribution; X-linked Notch-activated vs . mes-2 derepressed: p=1 . 31e-31; X-linked Notch-activated vs . mes-6 de-repressed: p=7 . 41e-25; autosomal Notch-activated vs . mes-2 derepressed: p=1 . 47e-22; autosomal Notch-activated vs . mes-6 de-repressed: p=1 . 8e-12 .

( B ) Mutants that were used in this study: while the loss-of-function ( lf ) alleles of glp-1 cause the loss of germ cells , gain-of-function ( gf ) alleles result in a constitutive proliferation of germ cells . However , in the absence of the meiosis-promoting GLD-1 and GLD-2 proteins , germ cells continue to proliferate in the absence of GLP-1Notch activity .

The central planes of the gonads were imaged . Nuclei were counted from those images using the CellCounter plugin with ImageJ .

'n' indicates the number of DAPI-stained gonads scored for each column . Empty vector 1\u20133 represent three independent replicates of the empty vector control and demonstrate the robustness of the experiment . We observed that , for an unknown reason , the rrf-1 ( pk1417 ) ; glp-1 ( ar202 ) double mutants were less likely to produce tumors at the semi-permissive temperature of 20\u00b0C . Nonetheless , the double mutant strain reacts to enhancers , suppressors , and depletion of PRC2 components in a similar manner as the glp-1 ( ar202 ) single mutant strain , with the exception of mbk-1 and B0416 . 5 RNAi . Depletion of mes-2 and mes-3 by RNAi was ineffective , since it did not enhance the tumourous phenotype in either of the two strains .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 15477 . 013 To demonstrate that Notch-activated genes are functionally relevant for germ cell proliferation , we performed RNAi knockdown of Notch-activated genes ( n\u00a0=\u00a064 ) on animals carrying the gain-of-function glp-1 ( ar202 ) allele , and screened for enhancement or suppression of the tumorous gonad phenotype ( Supplementary file 1; for detailed experimental procedure see Materials and Methods ) . Knocking down some of the Notch-activated genes suppressed the tumorous phenotype , which agrees with predominantly proliferation-promoting role of GLP-1Notch . Interestingly , knocking down a smaller\u00a0subset of the Notch-activated genes enhanced the tumor ( Supplementary file 1 ) , suggesting that some of the Notch-activated genes may counteract proliferation . While some of these genes may function autonomously in the germline , others could affect the germline indirectly from the soma . To test this , we RNAi-depleted selected candidates in the rrf-1 ( pk1417 ) mutant background , which is permissive for RNAi in the germline but deficient in RNAi in many ( but not all ) somatic tissues ( Kumsta and Hansen , 2012 ) . While depleting most candidates in the rrf-1 background had similar effects on the germline as in the wild type ( suggesting germline-autonomous function ) , in some cases the effects were abolished , suggesting that these genes function in the soma ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3 , Figure 2\u2014source data 1 ) . Strikingly , we noticed that Notch-activated genes were enriched on the X-chromosome , the C . elegans sex chromosome . 45% of the Notch-activated genes were X-linked , which is four-fold more than expected by chance ( p=2 . 99e-14; Figure 2A and Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2B , Figure 2\u2014source data 1 ) . When analyzing only genes with higher than baseline germline expression values , the disproportional X-linkage of Notch-activated genes was even more striking ( fifteen times more than expected by chance ( p=2 , 19e-38; Figure 2A and Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2B , Figure 2\u2014source data 1 ) . In the C . elegans germline , X-linked genes are largely silenced by the C . elegans PRC2 ( Fong et al . , 2002 ) . Thus , the X chromosome bias among Notch-activated genes suggested a possible antagonistic relationship between GLP-1Notch and PRC2 . The C . elegans PRC2 consists of MES-2 , -3 , and -6 ( Bender et al . , 2004 ) and levels of the corresponding transcripts were essentially not altered by GLP-1Notch signaling ( mes-2: absolute fold change ( fc ) -1 . 3747; mes-3: fc 1 . 003; mes-6: fc 1 . 037 ) . To test for a functional relationship between GLP-1Notch and PRC2 , we examined genetic interactions between GLP-1 and PRC2 mutants . At 20\u00b0C , both the temperature-sensitive gain-of-function glp-1 ( ar202 ) and the homozygous loss-of-function mes-2 ( bn11 ) mutants , derived from heterozygous mothers providing maternal MES-2 ( mes-2\u2009M+Z- mutants ) , were viable and produced gonads with nearly wild-type appearance . The double mes-2\u2009M+Z-; glp-1 ( ar202 ) mutants , however , displayed distal and proximal tumors at the same temperature ( Figure 2B; 32/32 examined gonads ) . PRC2 and GLP-1Notch thus interact functionally , and they appear to do so in a germ cell autonomous manner ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3 , Figure 2\u2014source data 1 ) . Given the striking enrichment of Notch-activated genes on the X chromosome , and the genetic interaction between PRC2 and GLP-1Notch , we speculated that GLP-1Notch and PRC2 act on similar genes . To determine whether Notch-activated genes are also PRC2-repressed , we first determined putative PRC2 targets by expression analyses on isolated wild-type , M+Z- mes-2 or mes-6 mutant gonads ( GEO accession number GSE49395 ) . Consistent with the joint function of MES-2 and MES-6 in the PRC2 complex , a very similar set of genes was upregulated upon the loss of either protein ( Figure 2C; Figure 2\u2014source data 1; henceforth \u2018PRC2 repressed\u2019 genes; also see ( Gaydos et al . , 2012 ) . Indeed , those PRC2-repressed genes overlapped strongly with Notch-activated genes , particularly those linked to the X chromosome . Nearly all of the X-linked Notch-activated genes were also derepressed upon the loss of PRC2 ( Figure 2C ) . This is consistent with the observed genetic interaction and suggests that increased GLP-1Notch signaling can induce expression of specific PRC2-repressed genes . This activation of the PRC2-repressed genes is not due to a global loss of the repressive tri-methylation of Histone H3 at lysine residue 27 ( H3K27me3 ) , since , upon examining gonads of different GLP-1Notch mutants , we observed no global loss of H3K27me3 in the germline ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4 ) . Germ cell conversion to neurons can be triggered not only by LIN-53 depletion but also by the depletion of PRC2 ( Patel et al . , 2012 ) . Potentially , the depletion of LIN-53 could facilitate reprograming by inhibiting PRC2 , since the depletion of LIN-53 results in a global loss of H3K27me3 in the germline ( Patel et al . , 2012 ) . Considering the antagonistic relation between GLP-1Notch and PRC2 on cell proliferation and gene regulation , we wondered whether GeCo triggered by the depletion of PRC2 would be sensitive to Notch signaling . Indeed , GeCo was strongly enhanced in PRC2-depleted ( mes-2 , mes-3 or mes-6 RNAi ) animals , when they also carried the gain-of-function glp-1 ( ar202 ) allele ( Figure 3A , Figure 3\u2014source data 1 ) . Moreover , similar to the LIN-53\u2013depleted gld-1 ( q497 ) gld-2 ( q485 ) ; glp-1 ( q175 ) gonads ( Figure 1D ) , the loss of GLP-1 effectively prevented GeCo in PRC2\u2013depleted gld-1 ( q497 ) gld-2 ( q485 ) ; glp-1 ( q175 ) gonads ( Figure 3B , Figure 3\u2014source data 1 ) . Together , these results suggest that GLP-1Notch stimulates GeCo in PRC2-compromised gonads . 10 . 7554/eLife . 15477 . 014Figure 3 . GLP-1Notch enhances reprograming upon the depletion of PRC2 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 15477 . 015 To determine how GLP-1Notch might counteract PRC2 , we depleted candidate Notch-activated genes ( Supplementary file 1 ) , and examined GeCo efficiency ( Figure 4A , Figure 4\u2014source data 1 ) . The strongest suppression of the GeCo+ and GeCo phenotype was observed upon the depletion of utx-1 , which also suppressed mes-3 RNAi-mediated GeCo+ in glp-1 ( ar202 ) gonads ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . Depletion of two other candidates , the uncharacterized C07G1 . 6 and the aldolase ortholog aldo-1 , also suppressed GeCo+ , albeit less efficiently ( Figure 4A ) . Because UTX-1 was suggested to effect gonadal development by functioning in the somatic gonad ( Vandamme et al . , 2012 ) , we re-examined GeCo efficiency upon utx-1 RNAi in the rrf-1 ( pk1417 ) background . Importantly , in rrf-1 mutants , RNAi is impaired in the somatic gonad , including the distal tip cell ( DTC ) , which constitutes the germline stem cell niche ( Kumsta and Hansen , 2012 ) . Because the suppression of GeCo+ upon utx-1 RNAi was observed also in the rrf-1 background , UTX-1 does not seem to enhance GeCo by functioning in the somatic gonad ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A ) . Furthermore , different genetic backgrounds and RNAi agains utx-1\u00a0do not affect the expression levels of\u00a0CHE-1 in the germline ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 15477 . 016Figure 4 . The H3K27 demethylase UTX-1 is required for GeCo enhancement . ( A ) UTX-1 is critical for GeCo enhancement . Candidate Notch-activated genes , selected from Supplementary file 2 with available RNAi clones , were assayed for a role in GeCo in glp-1 ( ar202 ) animals , expressing CHE-1\u2013induced nGFP and treated with lin-53 RNAi . While the additional depletion of utx-1 had the strongest impact on GeCo+ and GeCo , the depletion of C07G1 . 6 and aldo-1 had a weaker effect .

UTX-1 is required for the GeCo+ enhancement upon the depletion of PRC2 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 15477 . 018 Importantly , utx-1 encodes a conserved H3K27me3 demethylase , an enzyme erasing the repressive mark deposited by PRC2 ( Agger et al . , 2007; Jin et al . , 2011; Maures et al . , 2011 ) , potentially explaining how its depletion impairs GeCo efficiency . However , a number of other H3K27me3 demethylases exist in C . elegans , which prompted us to test whether depletion of these demethylases might have an effect on GeCo in the glp-1 ( ar202 ) gonads . We RNAi-depleted jmjd-1 . 2 , encoding a H3K9/27me2 demethylase ( Kleine-Kohlbrecher et al . , 2010 ) , jmjd-3 . 1 , jmjd-3 . 2 , and jmjd-3 . 3 , which were reported to demethylate H3K27me2/3 ( Agger et al . , 2007; Kleine-Kohlbrecher et al . , 2010; Zuryn et al . , 2014 ) , and , as a control , jmjd-2 , encoding a H3K9/36 demethylase ( Whetstine et al . , 2006; Greer et al . , 2014 ) ( Figure 4B , Figure 4\u2014source data 1 ) . Only the depletion of JMJD-1 . 2 suppressed GeCo+ significantly , though to a lesser degree than the depletion of UTX-1 ( Figure 4B , Figure 4\u2014source data 1 ) . The suppression of GeCo by the depletion of UTX-1 or JMJD-1 . 2 stresses the importance of counteracting PRC2 in reprograming . However , only the expression of utx-1 is activated by the GLP-1Notch signaling , suggesting that it is the activity of UTX-1 which is key for the reprograming dependent on GLP-1Notch signaling . The inhibition of GeCo enhancement upon utx-1 RNAi in the rrf-1 background suggested that UTX-1 functions in the germline . To test the potential expression of utx-1 in the germline , we constructed a strain expressing single copy-integrated , FLAG and GFP-tagged , functional UTX-1 ( expressed from the endogenous utx-1 promoter under the control of endogenous utx-1 3'UTR ) . We found that this protein was indeed expressed in the germline ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . To examine the potential transcriptional regulation of utx-1 expression by GLP-1Notch and PRC2 , we also created a strain expressing GFP-tagged histone H2B from the utx-1 promoter ( putx-1 reporter ) , under the control of an unregulated ( tbb-2 ) 3\u2019UTR . This construct was also single-copy integrated into a defined genomic location . With both the UTX-1 fusion protein and the putx-1 reporter , we expected expression patterns similar to that of other reported GLP-1Notch target genes ( Lamont et al . , 2004; Lee et al . , 2006; Kershner et al . , 2014 ) . Among these , lst-1 and sygl-1 account for the role of GLP-1Notch in stem cell maintenance , and both genes are expressed in the distal-most stem cells/progenitors ( Kershner et al . , 2014 ) . By contrast , both the UTX-1 fusion protein and the putx-1 reporter were little or not expressed in the distal-most , proliferative part of the germline ( Figure 5A\u2013C; Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . Concomitantly with progression through meiosis , their expression increased toward the proximal end of the gonad ( Figure 5A\u2013C ) . When examining the existing mRNA hybridization patterns of Notch-activated and PRC2-repressed genes ( 33 genes ) , we noticed that half of these ( 18 , all X-linked ) are similarly expressed in the medial and/or proximal , but not the distal-most , gonads ( Supplementary file 2 ) , arguing against direct transcriptional activation of these genes by GLP-1Notch in the wild type . Nevertheless , in agreement with the expression analyses , we observed increased expression of the putx-1 reporter in PRC2-depleted gonads; this increase occurred throughout the gonad , including the distal-most region ( Figure 5A ) . In situ hybridization for the endogenous utx-1 transcript also showed increased expression throughout the gonad in the absence of PRC2 ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . Moreover , expression of the putx-1 reporter was higher upon increased GLP-1Notch activity in glp-1 ( ar202 ) mutants , including the distal-most region where , in the wild\u00a0type , utx-1 is little or not expressed ( Figure 5B ) . Importantly , we found that the activation of the utx-1 promoter by Notch signaling was depended on the putative LAG-1/CSL binding sites within the promoter ( Yoo et al . , 2004 ) , as deleting those sites reduced reporter expression by approximately one-fourth ( Figure 5C ) . The interaction between LAG-1 and utx-1 was also tested by chromatin immunoprecipitation ( ChIP ) , performed on a strain expressing FLAG-tagged LAG-1 in either wild-type or glp-1 ( ar202 ) background ( Figure 5D and Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3 ) ; the previously identified GLP-1Notch targets , lst-1 and sygl-1 ( Kershner et al . , 2014 ) , served as positive controls for the ChIP . Expectedly , we observed the enhanced binding of LAG-1 to the utx-1 promoter , indicating that utx-1 is a transcriptional target of GLP-1Notch signaling . Summarizing , based on the observations in mutant backgrounds , PRC2 and GLP-1Notch signaling have antagonistic effects on utx-1 transcription . However , in wild type , the endogenous levels of GLP-1Notch signaling are apparently insufficient to overcome PRC2-mediated repression of utx-1 in the distal-most part of the gonad . 10 . 7554/eLife . 15477 . 019Figure 5 .

Results are represented as average changes in the GFP intensity ( relative to mock RNAi-ed or untreated animals ) . The error bars represent SEM . The numbers of analyzed gonads were as follows: n = 44 for wild-type reporter; n = 36 for glp-1 ( ar202 ) ; n = 55 for wild-type reporter on control RNAi; n = 48 for mes-2 ( RNAi ) ; n = 15 for mes-3 ( RNAi ) ; n = 29 for mes-6 ( RNAi ) , and n = 20 for the LAG-1 binding sites deleted reporter . ( A ) The putx-1::GFP reporter is repressed by PRC2 . In all mes-depleted gonads , the reporter was de-repressed in proliferating cells ( a ) as well as in more proximal gonadal regions ( b-c ) . ( B ) The putx-1::GFP reporter is upregulated by GLP-1Notch . In the gain-of-function glp-1 ( ar202 ) mutant , the reporter was strongly derepressed in the proliferating cells in the distal-most gonad ( a ) . Its expression was also increased in the more proximal regions ( b-c ) , which , in this mutant background , contain proliferating cells instead of meiotic cells . ( C ) putx-1::GFP expression depends on the predicted LAG-1/CSL binding sites in the promoter . Upon deletion of putative LAG-1/CSL binding sites , the reporter expression was abolished .

Both negative control lysates did not show any differences during the ChIP experiment when tested with either specific antibody ( anti-FLAG coupled to \u00b5MACS beads ) or unspecific antibody ( anti-HA coupled to \u00b5MACS beads ) . Lysates of worms expressing the recombinant target protein in N2 or glp-1 ( ar202 ) background were incubated with specific ( anti-FLAG ) and unspecific ( anti-HA ) antibodies coupled to \u00b5MACS beads .

Here , we report an unexpected role of GLP-1Notch signaling in promoting cell fate reprograming . To understand this phenomenon , we identified genes activated upon increased GLP-1Notch signaling . While the identified genes include the physiological GLP-1Notch targets , sygl-1 and lst-1 , many other genes , including utx-1 , appear to be only weakly or not expressed in the distal-most region of the wild-type gonad , where both sygl-1 and lst-1 are induced by GLP-1Notch ( Kershner et al . , 2014 ) . Thus , the wild-type levels of GLP-1Notch signaling are either insufficient to induce expression of many potential target genes ( see below ) , or their expression is controlled by additional mechanisms , perhaps similarly to lip-1 mRNA , which , while induced by GLP-1Notch , is post-transcriptionally degraded in the distal-most gonad ( Hajnal and Berset , 2002;\u00a0Lee et al . , 2006 ) . In addition to its major proliferation-promoting function , GLP-1Notch has been suggested to have a lesser role in promoting germ cell differentiation ( Hansen et al . , 2004 ) . Some of the identified Notch-activated genes appear to promote germ cell differentiation , potentially explaining the proposed differentiation-promoting function of GLP-1Notch . However , whether these genes are activated by GLP-1Notch and promote differentiation under physiological conditions remains to be determined . Many of the Notch-activated genes are repressed by PRC2 , suggesting that the expression of these genes is determined by the crosstalk between the extrinsic intercellular signaling pathway , Notch , and the intrinsic chromatin modifier PRC2 . Indeed , at least in the case of utx-1 , PRC2 appears to prevent its inappropriate expression in the distal-most gonad , which , nevertheless , can be overcome upon increased GLP-1Notch signaling . Our findings suggest that GLP-1Notch antagonizes PRC2 , at least in part , by stimulating expression of the H3K27 demethylase UTX-1 , which is essential for the enhancement of cellular reprograming . Previously , it was suggested that UTX-1 influences the germline by functioning in the somatic gonad ( Vandamme et al . , 2012 ) . However , by using the rrf-1 background , which displays defective RNAi in the somatic gonad , including the\u00a0DTC ( Kumsta and Hansen , 2012 ) , we found that the reprograming-promoting role of UTX-1 is unlikely to depend on its function in the somatic gonad . Although we cannot fully exclude the possibility that the reprograming-facilitating role of UTX-1 depends on its expression in another somatic tissue ( such as the intestine , in which RNAi remains functional in the rrf-1 mutant; Kumsta and Hansen , 2012 ) , the germline expression of UTX-1 reported here suggests a germline-autonomous function . Consistent with this hypothesis , manipulating either PRC2 or GLP-1Notch affected the germline expression of utx-1 . Although additional factors , such as the uncharacterized C07G1 . 6 and the ortholog of the human aldolase A ( Kuwabara and O'Neil , 2001; Shaye and Greenwald , 2011 ) might contribute to reprograming , they appear to be less critical . In addition to UTX-1 , another H3K27/H3K9-demethylating enzyme , JMJD-1 . 2 ( Kleine-Kohlbrecher et al . , 2010 ) , is required for enhanced reprograming . Similar to UTX-1 , JMJD-1 . 2 is likely to be directly involved in regulating chromatin accessibility , since its depletion results in increased levels of the repressive H3K9me2 and H3K27me2 modifications ( Kleine-Kohlbrecher et al . , 2010 ) . The reprograming-promoting role of JMJD-1 . 2 might indicate that , besides further demethylation of H3K27me2 , perhaps also the removal of H3K9me2 facilitates GeCo . Future studies will shed light on this interesting question . UTX-1 orthologs in other species contribute to tissue-specific chromatin signatures , for example during myogenesis or in cardiac development ( Seenundun et al . , 2010; Lee et al . , 2012 ) , and have been implicated in germ-cell and somatic reprograming ( Mansour et al . , 2012 ) . Together with our data , these findings underscore the importance of UTX-1 in cellular reprograming . Here , we suggest that one way the activity of UTX-1 may be stimulated to promote reprograming is through its Notch signaling-dependent transcriptional activation . Interestingly , an antagonistic relationship between Notch and PRC2 has also\u00a0been observed in T-cell leukemia ( Ntziachristos et al . , 2012 ) . A fascinating possibility is that a regulatory principle described here could help explain the etiology of this and perhaps other human diseases linked to a pathological increase in Notch signaling . \n Standard procedures were used to maintain animals . Worms ( RRID:WB_DL226 ) were grown at 25\u00b0C unless stated otherwise . All heat-shock and temperature-sensitive strains were kept at 15\u00b0C . The C . elegans lines used in this study are listed and described in detail in the Supplementary file 3A . The enhancer-suppressor screen on Notch targets was performed by feeding the animals with bacteria containing RNAi clones from the Ahringer and Vidal RNAi libraries . The clones not present in either of these libraries were cloned using primers as described in detail in the Supplementary file 3B . Experiments were performed at 15\u00b0C , 20\u00b0C or 25\u00b0C using bleached embryos or overnight-synchronized L1 animals as stated in Supplementary file 1 . The percentage of adult animals with the germline tumor phenotype was scored . To test germ-cell autonomy , RNAi clones that induced significant suppression or enhancement in either setting were re-tested in a strain carrying the glp-1 ( ar202 ) ( RRID:WB_GC833 ) allele and , additionally the rrf-1 ( pk1417 ) ( RRID:WB_NL2098 ) mutation , which impairs RNAi primarily in the soma ( Sijen et al . , 2001 ) . For this test , gravid adults were picked to RNAi plates and allowed to lay eggs overnight at the semi-permissive temperature of 20\u00b0C . Progeny was scored for enhancement or suppression of the germline tumorous phenotype at the young adult stage by DAPI staining of dissected gonads and scoring gonads as either wild-type , as containing a proximal or distal tumor but still some eggs , or as completely tumorous . Reprograming experiments were carried out as F1-RNAi . Worms were put on RNAi plates and the following F1 generation was screened for phenotypes . Used RNAi clones are described in the Supplementary file 3B . The genotype of the worms used for germ cell reprograming assays is BAT28 ( otIs305 ntIs1 , RRID:WB_OH9846 , details in Supplemental Materials and methods ) . Animals were synchronized by bleaching and eggs were put on NGM-agar containing E . coli OP50 ( RRID:WB_OP50 ) as a\u00a0food source to grow at 15\u00b0C until worms reached the L4-stage . At this stage 15\u201320 worms were put per well of a 6-well plate , containing bacteria expressing dsRNA or carrying an empty RNAi vector , and grown at 15\u00b0C until most of the F1 progeny reached the L3/L4 stage . The plates were heat-shocked at 37\u00b0C for 30\u2009min followed by an overnight incubation at 25\u00b0C . Next day ( ~16\u2009hrs post heat-shock ) the plates were screened for progeny showing ectopic GFP induction in the germline . To induce the Glp\u00a0phenotype in glp-1 ( ar202 ) , the animals were shifted to room temperature 9\u2009hrs before the heat-shock . For double RNAi , bacteria were grown as saturated culture . The OD600 was measured to ensure that the bacteria were mixed in an appropriate 1:1 ratio and subsequently seeded on RNAi 6-well plates . The RNAi screen was performed as described above . The p-values were calculated using Student's t-test . Hydroxyurea ( HU ) treatment was carried out as previously described ( Fox et al . , 2011; Patel et al . , 2012 ) . HU was added to seeded RNAi-plates at a final concentration of 250 \u00b5M . L4 worms ( strain BAT32 , details in Supplementary file 3A ) grown on RNAi-plates were transferred to HU plates and incubated at room temperature for 5\u2009hrs prior to heat-shock in order to induce CHE-1 expression . To test HU efficiency , control animals were treated with HU for 12\u2009hrs with subsequent staining for DAPI and H3Ser10ph ( pH3 ) antibody ( Abcam #ab5176 ) . After overnight incubation , the worms were assessed for GFP induction in the germline as described above . To assess the efficiency of the HU treatment , the E . coli strain MG1693 ( E . coli stock center ) , with incorporated 5-ethynyl-20-deoxyuridine ( EdU ) , was used to feed L3/L4 worms . EdU in combination with DAPI staining was performed similar to the procedure described previously ( Ito and McGhee , 1987 ) and according to the manufacturer's instructions ( Invitrogen , Europe ) of the EdU labeling kit . The Click-iT EdU reaction buffer ( Invitrogen , Europe ) was mixed with Alexa Fluor azide ( \u2018click\u2019 reaction ) dye to detect cells that were replicating DNA . Staining was performed by freeze cracking worms after fixation with 2% formaldehyde . Parental animals were raised at 15\u00b0C and shifted to 25\u00b0C for egg laying . Offspring was dissected after the L4-adult transition . Fifty gonads per analyzed genotype in triplicates were dissected in M9 containing levamisole . RNA was isolated using the PicoPure RNA Isolation Kit ( Applied Biosystems ) according to the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations . Total RNA ( 200 ng for the Notch ON/OFF experiments or 100 ng for the mes/wild-type experiments ) was amplified using the Affymetrix GeneChip WT Amplified Double Stranded cDNA Synthesis Kit according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions . The Affymetrix GeneChip WT Double-Stranded cDNA Terminal Labeling Kit was used for the fragmentation and labeling of 7 . 5\u2009\u03bcg cDNA . The labeled material was loaded onto Affymetrix GeneChip C . elegans Tiling 1 . 0R Arrays and hybridized at 65\u00baC for 16\u2009hrs . The arrays were washed in an Affymetrix Fluidics station with the protocol FS450_0001 and scanned in an Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner 3000 with autoloader using Affymetrix GCC Scan Control v . 3 . 0 . 0 . 1214 software . All tiling arrays were processed in R ( 32 , 33 ) using Bioconductor ( 34 ) and the packages tilingArray and preprocessCore . The arrays were RMA background corrected and log2 transformed on the oligo level using the following command: expr <- log2 ( rma . background . correct ( exprs ( readCel2eSet ( filenames , rotated = TRUE ) ) ) ) . We mapped the oligos from the tiling array ( bpmap file from www . affymetrix . com ) to the C . elegans genome assembly ce6 ( www . genome . ucsc . edu ) using bowtie ( Langmead et al . , 2009 ) , allowing no error and unique mapping position . Expressions for individual transcripts were calculated by intersecting the genomic positions of the oligos with transcript annotation ( WormBase WS190 ) and averaging the intensity of the respective oligos . For the mes-4/wt experiment , no quantile normalization was performed as the distributions for the mes-4 mutant and the wt differed substantially . In the case of the Notch ON/OFF dataset quantile normalization was performed on the level of transcripts . The p-values were calculated in R with the hypergeometric distribution function 'phyper' . RNA was isolated as described above . cDNA was synthesized with oligo dT primer using the ImProm II Reverse Transcription System from Promega according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions . cDNA was used for qPCR with the Absolute QPCR SYBR Green ROX Mix ( AbGene ) on an ABI PRISM 7700 system ( Applied Biosystems ) . qPCR reactions were performed as described previously ( Biedermann et al . , 2009 ) . At least one primer in each pair is specific for an exon-exon junction . Sequences of the used primers are described in detail in the Supplementary file 3C . Mouse RNA was added before RNA isolation and reverse transcription , allowing for normalization to cyt-c and thereby correcting for variations in RNA isolation and reverse transcription . Standard curves for quantification were generated from a serial dilution of input cDNA for each primer pair . The amount of target present in each replicate was derived from the standard curve; an average was calculated for each of the triplicates . To compare total mRNA levels , the qPCR results were normalized to mouse cyt-c and to the C . elegans tubulin gene tbb-2 , and fold enrichments were calculated . RNA in situ hybridization was performed and analyzed as previously described ( Biedermann et al . , 2009 ) . Description of the primer pairs to generate probes from cDNA can be found in the Supplementary file 3C . Images were captured with a Zeiss AxioImager Z1 microscope , equipped with a Zeiss AxioCam MRc camera . Images were taken in linear mode of the Axiovision software ( Zeiss ) and processed with Adobe Photoshop CS4 in an identical manner . ChIP was performed as described ( Askjaer et al . , 2014 ) . In brief , worms ( strains OP591 , RRID:WB_OP591 , and BAT890 ) were washed with M9 buffer and frozen as \u2018worm popcorn\u2019 in liquid nitrogen prior to pulverization with a mortar and pestle . The powder was dissolved in 10 volumes of 1 , 1% formaldehyde in PBS + 1\u00a0mM PMSF and incubated 10\u2009mins with gentle rocking at room temperature with subsequent quenching for 5\u2009mins at room temperature by adding 2 , 5 molar glycine ( final concentration 125\u2009mM ) . After centrifugation with 4 . 000\u2009g at 4\u00b0C the pellet was washed with ice-cold PBS+1\u00a0mM PMSF and resuspended in 50\u2009mM FA buffer ( 50\u2009mM HEPES/KOH pH 7 , 5; 1\u00a0mM EDTA; 1% Triton-X 100; 0 , 1% sodium deoxycholate; 150\u2009mM NaCl ) + 1% sarkosyl + protease-inhibitors . Samples were sonicated twice using the Biorupter ( 15 times 30 s ON , 30 s OFF ) on high settings at 4\u00b0C followed by spinning at 13 . 000\u2009g , 15\u2009min , 4\u00b0C . The supernatant corresponding to 4 mg of protein measured by Bradford assay was used for ChIPs . Samples were incubated with 50 \u00b5l of FLAG or HA antibodies coupled to \u00b5MACS microbeads ( Milteny ) ( all blocked with 5% milk in FA-buffer ) . After incubating 1\u2009hr at 4\u00b0C , the beads where washed in \u00b5MACS matrix columns in a magnetic rack with FA buffer containing 1\u00a0M and 0 . 5\u2009M NaCl and subsequent wash with TE and TEL buffer ( 0 , 25\u2009M LiCl; 1% Sodium deoxycholate; 1\u2009mM EDTA; 10\u2009mM Tris pH 8 , 0 ) . Bound material was eluted with 65\u00b0C pre-warmed 125 \u00b5l ChIP elution buffer ( 1% SDS , 250\u2009mM NaCl , 10\u2009mM Tris pH 8 . 0 , 1\u2009mM EDTA ) and fixation was reversed using 2 \u00b5l of 10 mg/ml Proteinase K at at 50\u00b0C for 1\u2009hr followed by 65\u00b0C incubation overnight . DNA was purified using the Quiaquick PCR purification kit in a final volume of 40 \u00b5l and 1 \u00b5l was used for qPCR . Negative controls were used to assess the quality of the ChIP and fold enrichment of the target genes: lysates ( N2 worms ) which do not express the recombinant target protein with specific antibody ( anti-FLAG coupled to \u00b5MACS beads ) and lysates of worms expressing the recombinant target protein with unspecific antibody ( anti-HA coupled to \u00b5MACS beads ) controls , respectively . Primer for qPCRs was designed using Primer3Plus ( Untergasser et al . , 2007 ) with the following settings: amplified region min . 100 bp \u2013 max . 200 bp; GC content: 50\u201360%; min . primer length: 18 nt \u2013 max . length 24 nt; melting temperature: min . 58\u00b0C \u2013 max . 63\u00b0C; max . ; 3' self complementary allowance set to 1; max . allowed length of a mononucleotide repeat ( max . poly-x ) : 3 . Sequences of the used primers are listed in in the Supplementary file 3C . The qPCRs were run on CFX96 Touch Real-Time PCR Detection System from BioRad using the Maxima SYBR Green/ROX qPCR Master Mix ( 2X ) . The data analysis was performed by calculating the \u0394\u0394Ct-values . Differences were assessed using Student's t-test . Worms were transferred to a slide and fixed by adding 10\u201320 \u00b5l 95% ethanol and letting evaporate the ethanol . The ethanol fixation was repeated 2 more times before adding the DAPI solution in microscopy mounting media ( vectashield from Vector or similar ) . The samples were sealed with a coverslip and nail polish before microscopy . Fluorescent micrographs were recorded with Zeiss AxioImager Z1 microscope and the SensicamII camera ( PCO ) and the micromanager software was used to capture Z-stack images with 0 . 5 \u00b5m slice steps . Images subject to direct comparison were taken at identical exposure times . Counting of germ cells within the range from the DTC to the turn of gonadal arms of glp-1 ( ar202 ) ; hsp::che-1; gcy-5::gfp animals treated with either mock or lin-53 RNAi was performed using the Z-stacks . Micromanager was used to control the Z-stack levels and the ImageJ plugin for cell counting for scoring the number of germ cells . Germ cell counts in gonads of Notch ON: gld-2 ( q497 ) gld-1 ( q485 ) ; glp-1 ( ar202 ) and Notch OFF: gld-2 ( a497 ) gld-1 ( q485 ) ; glp-1 ( e2144 ) ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2 ) and germline tumor phenotype in glp-1 ( ar202 ) and glp-1 ( ar202 ) ; rrf-1 ( pk1417 ) were scored after dissection , formaldehyde fixation and DAPI staining . For Notch ON and Notch OFF mutants , the central plane of the gonads was imaged and germ cells in the entire dissected gonad were counted using the CellCounter plugin with ImageJ . For each of the two strains , germ cells in the entire gonad of 15 dissected gonads were counted . Antibody stainings of intact worms were performed using a freeze-crack procedure as described ( Duerr , 2006 ) . In brief , after washing , worms were resuspended in 0 . 025% glutaraldehyde , and frozen between two frost-resistant glass slides on dry ice . Separating the glass slides while frozen creates additional cracks in the cuticle . Acetone/methanol or 4% paraformaldehyde in 0 . 1\u00a0M phosphate buffer for 1\u2009hr on ice fixation was used . Worms were washed off the slides in PBS , blocked with 0 . 2% gelatin + 0 . 25% Triton in PBS , and stained . Primary antibodies were diluted in PBS with 0 . 1% gelatin and 0 . 25% Triton and fixed worms were incubated 4\u2009hrs - overnight at 4\u00b0C . After PBS washes secondary antibody was applied for 3\u2009hrs . After PBS washes worms were mounted with DAPI-containing mounting medium ( Dianova , #CR-38448 ) on glass slides . The primary antibodies used were anti-H3K27me3 ( 1:400; gift from Dr . Hiroshi Kimura ) ; anti-HA ( 1:100 , Roche #12CA5; acetone fixation ) ; anti-H3Ser10ph ( 1:400 , Abcam , #ab14955; acetone fixation ) . Secondary antibodies were Alexa Fluor dyes applied at 1:1000 dilution . Stainings for H3K27me3 on dissected gonads were performed using anti-H3K27me3 from Millipore ( catalogue number 07\u2013449 , Lot 1959680; courtesy of Jan Padeken , Gasser laboratory ) on dissected gonads . The\u00a0adult animals were dissected in M9 containing levamisole , fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS on poly-lysine coated slides , snap-frozen on dry ice , freeze-cracked , incubated for 5 mins in ice-cold DMF at \u221220\u00b0 , washed for 5\u2009mins in PBS 0 . 1% Tween-20 at room temperature , blocked for 20\u2009mins in PBS 0 . 1% Tween-20 + 5% BSA and incubated with the primary antibody over night at 4\u00b0C . Secondary antibodies ( Alexa 488 , goat anti rabbit , 1:500 ) were applied for 2\u00a0hrs at room temperature . Slides were then washed three times for 5\u2009mins in PBS 0 . 1% Tween-20 at room temperature and mounted with Vectashield mounting medium containing DAPI . The transcriptional reporter gene putx-1::gfp-h2b ( rrrSi185 ) was constructed from the 1302 bp putative promoter region of the gene utx-1 ( human UTX ( Ubiquitously transcribed TPR on X ) homolog - 1 ) fused to sequences encoding for GFP-H2B and the ubiquitously expressed tbb-2 3\u2019UTR using the Gateway Reporter Cloning System ( Merritt et al . , 2008 ) . The reporter gene putx-1::gfp-h2b ( rrrSi185 and rrrSi281 ) was constructed with the following primers: putx-attB4: GGGGACAACTTTGTATAGAAAAGTTGGGATTTTATCTTCATCGGACCTG putx-attB1 : GGGGACTGCTTTTTTGTACAAACTTGTGGCGGTGTGAGAAGCGATAC The full-length functional transgene putx-1::flag-gfp-utx-1::utx-1 3\u2019UTR ( rrrSi189 ) was constructed with the following primers: utx-1+3UTR+attB2 L ggggacagctttcttgtacaaagtggACGACGAATCAGAACCTCTGCCGGAGGAGCGTCATgtaag utx-1+3UTR+attB3 R ggggacaactttgtataataaagttgaatgcggatactgccttctc The functional UTX-1 transgene putx-1::flag-gfp-tev::utx-1::utx-1 3\u2019utr ( rrrSi189 ) contains the same promoter as the transcriptional reporter , the full-length utx-1 genomic sequence as well as the endogenous 3\u2019UTR , and was equipped with N-terminal GFP , FLAG , and TEV tags . Transgenic animals were produced\u00a0as\u00a0single-copy integrants\u00a0using the MosSCI direct insertion protocol ( Fr\u00f8kjaer-Jensen et al . , 2008 ) . The rrrSi189 transgene is functional , as it rescues the utx-1 mutant ( ok3553 allele ) . For GFP quantification , gonads were dissected from live animals in M9 buffer containing levamisole and mounted to glass microscopy slides ( Fr\u00f8kjaer-Jensen et al . , 2008 ) . Fluorescent micrographs were recorded with Zeiss AxioImager Z1 microscope and a Zeiss Axioncam MRm REV 2 CCD camera was used to capture images . Fluorescence intensities were quantified using ImageJ . GFP intensities were normalized to the picture background and corrected with the average autofluorescences measured in wild type ( N2 ) gonads at the corresponding temperatures . Images subject to direct comparison were taken at identical exposure times and were processed with Adobe Photoshop CS4 in an identical manner . The numbers of analyzed gonads were as follows: n = 44 for wild-type reporter; n = 36 for glp-1 ( gf ts ) ; n = 55 for wild-type reporter on control RNAi; n = 48 for mes-2 ( RNAi ) ; n = 15 for mes-3 ( RNAi ) ; n = 29 for mes-6 ( RNAi ) , and n = 20 for LAG-1 binding sites deleted reporter . Alleles used were glp-1 ( ar202 ) and mes-2 ( bn11 ) . Worms were grown at the semi-permissive temperature of 20\u00b0C and gonads were dissected and DAPI-stained shortly after the L4-young adult transition . The experiment was performed twice . In a first round , a low number of gonads were examined to identify whether the double mutant had a phenotype and to define phenotypic categories to score . Based on the observation of a clear and penetrant phenotype , gonads were scored in a second round according to the categories defined in the first round .", "headings": ["Abstract", "Introduction", "Results", "Discussion", "Materials and methods"], "keywords": ["developmental biology"], "id": "elife-15477-v3"}
{"lay_summary": "Klebsiella pneumoniae is a type of bacteria that can cause life-threatening infections \u2013 including pneumonia , blood stream infections , and urinary tract infections \u2013 in hospitalized patients . These infections can be difficult to treat because some K . pneumoniae are resistant to antibiotics . The bacteria are normally found in the human intestine , and they do not usually cause infections in healthy people . This implies that healthy people\u2019s immune systems are better able to fend off K . pneumoniae infections; learning how could help scientists develop new ways to treat or prevent infections in hospitalized patients . In healthy people , a type of immune cell called neutrophils are the first line of defense against bacterial infections . Several different proteins are needed to activate neutrophils , including a protein called SKAP2 . But the role of this protein in fighting K . pneumoniae infections is not clear . To find out what role SKAP2 plays in the defense against pneumonia caused by K . pneumoniae , Nguyen et al . compared infections in mice with and without the protein . Mice lacking SKAP2 in their white blood cells had more bacteria in their lungs than normal mice . The experiments showed that neutrophils from mice with SKAP2 produce a burst of chemicals called \u201creactive oxygen species\u201d , which can kill bacteria . But neutrophils without the protein do not . Without SKAP2 , several proteins that help produce reactive oxygen species do not work . Understanding the role of SKAP2 in fighting infections may help scientists better understand the immune system . This could help clinicians to treat conditions that cause it to be hyperactive or ineffective . More studies are needed to determine if SKAP2 works the same way in human neutrophils and if it works against all types of K . pneumoniae . If it does , then scientists might be able use this information to develop therapies that help the immune system fight infections .", "article": "Klebsiella pneumoniae is a respiratory , blood , liver , and bladder pathogen of significant clinical concern . We show that the adaptor protein , SKAP2 , is required for protection against K . pneumoniae ( ATCC 43816 ) pulmonary infections . Skap2-/- mice had 100-fold higher bacterial burden when compared to wild-type and burden was controlled by SKAP2 expression in innate immune cells . Skap2-/- neutrophils and monocytes were present in infected lungs , and the neutrophils degranulated normally in response to K . pneumoniae infection in mice; however , K . pneumoniae-stimulated reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) production in vitro was abolished . K . pneumoniae-induced neutrophil ROS response required the activity of SFKs , Syk , Btk , PLC\u03b32 , and PKC . The loss of SKAP2 significantly hindered the K . pneumoniae-induced phosphorylation of SFKs , Syk , and Pyk2 implicating SKAP2 as proximal to their activation in pathogen-signaling pathways . In conclusion , SKAP2-dependent signaling in neutrophils is essential for K . pneumoniae-activated ROS production and for promoting bacterial clearance during infection . \n Klebsiella pneumoniae is an opportunistic Gram-negative pathogen that can cause a wide range of life-threatening infections , including pneumonia , sepsis and urinary tract infections ( Bengoechea and Sa Pessoa , 2019; Paczosa and Mecsas , 2016; European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control , 2018; Weiner et al . , 2016 ) . K . pneumoniae is a leading cause of hospital-associated infections with one recent study reporting that K . pneumoniae contributes to 7 . 7% of cases from over 4500 hospitals ( Weiner et al . , 2016 ) . The increasing number of severe , and sometimes systemic , K . pneumoniae infections are largely attributed to a rise in antibiotic-resistant strains ( Falagas et al . , 2014; European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control , 2018; Kobayashi et al . , 2016 ) and hypervirulent strains that generate thicker capsules ( Zhang et al . , 2016; Harada et al . , 2019; Lam et al . , 2018 ) . Highlighting the importance of the innate immune response , neutropenic patients are highly susceptible to life-threatening respiratory and bloodstream infections , including those caused by K . pneumoniae ( Zhu et al . , 2018; Micozzi et al . , 2017 ) . K . pneumoniae lung pathogenesis has been extensively investigated in a mouse model using the rodent-adapted ATCC 43816 ( Bengoechea and Sa Pessoa , 2019; Lawlor et al . , 2005; Xiong et al . , 2015; Bachman et al . , 2015; Vornhagen et al . , 2019; Batra et al . , 2012 ) . In murine models of infection , the K . pneumoniae 43816 strain robustly infects lungs eliciting a strong innate immune response through rapid and concurrent recruitment of neutrophils and iMOs to the infected lungs ( Lawlor et al . , 2005; Xiong et al . , 2015; Cai et al . , 2010; Batra et al . , 2012; Sharma et al . , 2014; Ye et al . , 2001 ) . Work using this strain has revealed several genes that protect K . pneumoniae against the host neutrophil response ( Paczosa et al . , 2020; Silver et al . , 2019 ) . Neutrophils are the first responder cell type for fighting against invading pathogens , however , their activation is tightly regulated to prevent severe tissue damage that have been correlated with several autoimmune and inflammatory diseases ( M\u00f3csai , 2013 ) . At the site of infection , neutrophils can bind to pathogens leading to the activation of various killing mechanisms , including phagocytosis , generation of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) , degranulation , and release of neutrophil extracellular traps ( NETs ) ( Futosi et al . , 2013; Nguyen et al . , 2017; M\u00f3csai , 2013 ) . Although the K . pneumoniae capsule decreases bacterial binding and internalization ( Regueiro et al . , 2006; March et al . , 2013 ) , ROS , degranulation , NETs , and cytokine production have all been implicated in host defense against K . pneumoniae ( Bengoechea and Sa Pessoa , 2019; Chen et al . , 2016; Hirche et al . , 2005; Ivin et al . , 2017; Paczosa et al . , 2020; Papayannopoulos et al . , 2010; Zhao et al . , 2015 ) . The importance of ROS in host protection is highlighted in the setting of Chronic Granulomatous Disease ( CGD ) , a disease characterized by genetic mutations in the NADPH oxidase , where patients are unable to make ROS and are susceptible to Klebsiella infections ( Wolach et al . , 2017; Bortoletto et al . , 2015 ) . Furthermore , mice with defective ROS production ( Cybb-/- ) have a\u00a0higher bacterial burden than wild-type mice during K . pneumoniae lung infection ( Paczosa et al . , 2020 ) . Receptor-mediated ROS production in neutrophils is driven by signal-transduction pathways that activate components of the NADPH oxidase complex ( Nguyen et al . , 2017; Futosi et al . , 2013 ) . These signaling pathways are tightly regulated to prevent inappropriate activation and subsequent tissue damage ( Futosi et al . , 2013 ) . Work in mice suggests that signaling through integrin , mincle receptors , G-protein couple receptors ( GPCRs ) and toll-like receptors ( TLRs ) are critical for protection against K . pneumoniae infection ( Teng et al . , 2016; Sharma et al . , 2014; Sharma et al . , 2017; Regueiro et al . , 2006; Galv\u00e3o et al . , 2018; Bengoechea and Sa Pessoa , 2019 ) . In fact , multiple receptors may sense and/or bind to K . pneumoniae triggering ROS production . Prior studies have indicated a critical role for Src Kinase Associated Phosphoprotein-2 , SKAP2 ( SKAP-Hom and SKAP-55R ) downstream of integrin , and GPCRs in neutrophils and macrophages ( Boras et al . , 2017; Alenghat et al . , 2012; Swanson et al . , 2008; Tanaka et al . , 2016; M\u00f3csai et al . , 2002; Togni et al . , 2005 ) . SKAP2 , a cytosolic adaptor protein , is required for integrin-mediated ROS production , adhesion , and migration to sterile inflammatory sites through its interaction with mediators of actin rearrangement ( Alenghat et al . , 2012; Boras et al . , 2017; Shimamura et al . , 2013; Tanaka et al . , 2016 ) . SKAP2 is also a target for inactivation by bacterial virulence factors , suggesting that it plays a key role in host defenses against infections ( Black et al . , 2000; Rol\u00e1n et al . , 2013 ) . In humans , the Skap2 gene has been identified as a risk locus for Type 1 Diabetes , and Crohn\u2019s disease ( Jostins et al . , 2012; Barrett et al . , 2009 ) . In resting cells , SKAP2 is thought to exist in an autoinhibitory conformation as a homodimer that is constitutively bound to PRAM-1 in neutrophils ( Moog-Lutz et al . , 2001; Rol\u00e1n et al . , 2013 ) , or its homolog , ADAP , in other immune cells ( Liu et al . , 1998; Marie-Cardine et al . , 1998; Black et al . , 2000; Ophir et al . , 2013 ) . Upon receptor activation , SKAP2 changes to an active conformation that is localized to the plasma membrane , which allows it to interact other effector proteins including Src Family Kinases ( SFKs ) ( Bureau et al . , 2018; Marie-Cardine et al . , 1998; Liu et al . , 1998 ) . In addition , activated SKAP proteins can relay information from receptors to focal adhesion kinases ( FAK1/Pyk2 ) to other cytoskeletal mediators ( M\u00e9nasch\u00e9 et al . , 2007; Boras et al . , 2017; Tanaka et al . , 2016; Raab et al . , 2017; Ophir et al . , 2013 ) . Using a murine model of K . pneumoniae 43816 infection , we characterized the role of SKAP2 in pulmonary host defense against K . pneumoniae in this study . We demonstrate that SKAP2-expressing neutrophils contributed to the pulmonary containment of K . pneumoniae in lungs independent of inflammatory monocytes . Using murine neutrophils , we show that K . pneumoniae-induced ROS production requires SKAP2 , SFKs , Syk , PLC\u03b3 , Btk , and PKC , and that SKAP2 is required for maximal K . pneumoniae-activated phosphorylation of the tyrosine kinases SFKs , Syk , and Pyk2 . \n To examine the role of SKAP2 in the pathogenesis of pneumonic K . pneumoniae infection , we intranasally infected wild-type ( WT ) BALB/c or BALB/c Skap2-/-\u00a0mice with a streptomycin-resistant derivative of K . pneumoniae 43816 , a hyper-capsule producer that belongs to one of the most common hypervirulent serotype , K2 ( Paczosa and Mecsas , 2016; Paczosa et al . , 2020; Silver et al . , 2019 ) . Previous studies using K . pneumoniae 43816 or a derivative of this strain have reported a 50% lethal dose at 48 hr after infection with 3\u22125 \u00d7 103 colony forming units ( cfu ) in BALB/c mice , and a robust infection with high bacterial burden and cellular infiltration in the lungs by 24 hr with mice developing disseminated infection by 48 hr in C57BL/6J ( Lawlor et al . , 2005; Xiong et al . , 2015; Ye et al . , 2001; Feldman et al . , 2019 ) . WT and Skap2-/-\u00a0mice were infected with 5 \u00d7 103 cfu and were monitored for weight loss , bacterial colonization , and innate cell recruitment at 8 , 16 , and 24 hr post infection ( hpi ) ( Figure 1A\u2013C; Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A , E\u2013J ) . Consistent with prior studies , by 24 hr , infected WT mice lost 2% of their body weight , and K . pneumoniae reached on average 106 cfu with a 5-fold increase in neutrophil presence in the infected lungs ( Figure 1A\u2013C; Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A; Xiong et al . , 2015 ) . However , Skap2-/-\u00a0mice lost significantly more body weight than the WT cohort at 24 hpi ( Figure 1A ) and had significantly higher bacterial loads in their lungs at 16 and 24 hpi ( Figure 1B ) , indicating that Skap2-/-\u00a0mice are less competent at controlling K . pneumoniae infection . The increase in bacterial burden did not appear to be due to differences in the numbers of neutrophils ( CD11b+ Ly6Ghi ) because neutrophils were detected at comparable levels in WT and Skap2-/-\u00a0lungs , bone marrow as well as bronchoalveolar lavage of infected mice ( Figure 1C; Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013D ) . In addition , there was no difference in alveolar macrophages ( CD11bint CD11chi ) , resident monocytes ( CD11b+ Gr1lo ) , or dendritic cells ( CD11bhi CD11chi ) in the lungs of K . pneumoniae-infected WT and Skap2-/-\u00a0mice ( Figure 1C; Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1E\u2013J ) . Histological examination showed extensive leukocyte infiltration in both the WT and Skap2-/-\u00a0infected lungs supporting the flow cytometry data ( Figure 1D\u2013L , black arrows ) . This interstitial infiltration inflammatory cells can be seen in the early stages of infection prior to bronchopneumonia ( Lawlor et al . , 2005; Xiong et al . , 2015 ) . Furthermore , some infected Skap2-/-\u00a0lungs ( 2/5 lungs ) had lesions with cellular destruction and uncontrolled bacterial growth surrounded by sparse leukocyte infiltration ( Figure 1K\u2013L , blue arrows ) . To evaluate whether SKAP2-dependent control of K . pneumoniae colonization was required in a different mouse background , C57BL/6J , C57BL/6J Skap2-/- , or heterozygous littermates were inoculated retropharyngeally with K . pneumoniae ( Figure 1M\u2013N; Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1K\u2013N ) . At 24 hpi , C57BL/6 Skap2-/-\u00a0mice had a significant increase in bacterial burden compared to C57BL/6 and heterozygous littermates ( Figure 1M ) . In general , comparable numbers of neutrophils and inflammatory monocytes were detected in all three strains ( Figure 1N; Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1L\u2013N ) although the percent of neutrophils recovered in C57Bl/6 Skap2-/-\u00a0mice was higher ( Figure 1N ) In summary , although leukocytes are present in the Skap2-/-\u00a0lungs at comparable or slightly higher level to wild-type lungs , Skap2-/-\u00a0mice were more susceptible to K . pneumoniae infection suggesting that their antimicrobial functions are compromised . To investigate whether Skap2 expression in bone marrow-derived leukocytes was required for controlling the antibacterial response to K . pneumoniae infection , we generated bone marrow ( BM ) chimeric mice by transplanting WT or Skap2-/-\u00a0BM cells into either WT or Skap2-/-\u00a0mice ( Figure 2A ) . Transplantation efficiency was confirmed by flow cytometry ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . WT recipient mice reconstituted with Skap2-/-\u00a0BM had significantly more K . pneumoniae in contrast to WT mice transplanted with WT BM ( Figure 2B ) . Conversely , Skap2-/-\u00a0recipients with WT BM cells had significantly decreased K . pneumoniae in their lungs as compared to Skap2-/-\u00a0hosts that received Skap2-/-\u00a0BM cells ( Figure 2B ) . The differences in bacterial burdens were not due to differences in numbers of neutrophils as equivalent numbers were recovered among all four groups of mice ( Figure 2C; Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C\u2013E ) . While fewer inflammatory monocytes ( iMOs ) were detected in Skap2-/-\u00a0recipients regardless of BM cell donor , the difference did not correlate with bacterial load ( Figure 2B , D; Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1F\u2013H ) . Combined , these data indicate Skap2 expression in BM-derived immune cells is required to contain K . pneumoniae growth during lung infection , and that Skap2 expression in cells that are not derived from the marrow do not contribute to this phenotype . The contribution of neutrophils and iMOs to host defense against K . pneumoniae infection is dependent on the bacterial strain used with K . pneumoniae ATCC 43816 being more susceptible to neutrophils ( Xiong et al . , 2015; Silver et al . , 2019 ) . To determine the role of neutrophils and iMOs in the increased susceptibility of Skap2-/-\u00a0mice to K . pneumoniae , WT and Skap2-/-\u00a0mice were treated with the \u03b1-Ly6G ( clone 1A8 ) to deplete neutrophils , or the MC-21 antibody , which targets CCR2+ cells to deplete iMOs ( Figure 2E ) . Depletion efficiency was confirmed by flow cytometry ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2A\u2013F ) . While the K . pneumoniae burden in iMOs-depleted WT mice was similar to vehicle-treated mice , significantly more bacteria were recovered from the lungs of neutrophil-depleted WT mice ( Figure 2E ) confirming the importance of neutrophils in host defense ( Ye et al . , 2001; Xiong et al . , 2015 ) . The neutrophil-depleted WT mice had similarly high bacterial burdens as Skap2-/-\u00a0mice ( Figure 2E ) , and the depletion of Skap2-/-\u00a0mice of neutrophils or iMOs did not increase their bacterial burden suggesting that protection against K . pneumoniae infection is SKAP2-dependent ( Figure 2E ) . To assess the contribution of Skap2 expression in BM-derived iMOs and neutrophils in limiting K . pneumoniae infection , iMOs and neutrophils were depleted from irradiated Skap2-/-\u00a0mice that had been reconstituted with WT BM cells ( Figure 2F ) . Depletion efficiency was confirmed by flow cytometry ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2G\u2013J ) . As expected , reconstitution of Skap2-/-\u00a0mice with WT BM resulted in a significant reduction in bacterial burden compared to Skap2-/-\u00a0mice that received Skap2-/-\u00a0BM cells ( Figure 2F ) . Skap2-/-\u00a0mice that received WT BM and were then depleted of neutrophils with \u03b1-Ly6G showed an increase in bacterial load and that burden was similar to those in Skap2-/-\u00a0mice that received Skap2-/-\u00a0neutrophils ( Figure 2F ) . By contrast , \u03b1-CCR2-treated mice had a similar bacterial burden as PBS-treated mice ( Figure 2F ) . Together , these data indicate that neutrophils cannot control K . pneumoniae 43816 infection in the absence of SKAP2 in the hematopoietic compartment . As Skap2-/-\u00a0neutrophils are present in infected tissues ( Figure 1D , J , N; Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013D ) , the uncontrolled K . pneumoniae growth may occur because of defects in the antimicrobial functions of Skap2-/-\u00a0neutrophils at the site of infection . Neutrophils have multiple antimicrobial mechanisms to limit bacterial growth during infection ( Futosi et al . , 2013; M\u00f3csai , 2013 ) . To investigate which antimicrobial functions are controlled by SKAP2 , the ER-Hoxb8 conditionally-immortalized stem cell system was adopted as a tool to produce a supply of neutrophils ( Wang et al . , 2006; Chu et al . , 2019 ) . Mouse BM-derived stem cells from WT and Skap2-/-\u00a0mice were retrovirally transduced with Hoxb8 regulated by estrogen ( ER-Hoxb8 ) , and maintained in media containing estrogen ( E2 ) and stem cell factor ( SCF ) to expand granulocyte-monocyte progenitors ( GMP ) in vitro ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013I and see Materials and Methods ) . Removal of E2 inactivates Hoxb8 expression and the addition of interleukin-3 and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor led to terminal neutrophil differentiation ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013I ) . Neutrophil maturation from WT and Skap2-/-\u00a0ER-HoxB8-immortalized GMP cells ( Hoxb8 GMP ) was evaluated by nuclear morphology ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B ) and cell surface expression of cKit , CD11b and Ly6G ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C\u2013D , G\u2013I ) . Hoxb8 GMP cells were mononuclear and cKit+ CD11b- Ly6G- ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C\u2013D , G\u2013I ) . Cells from both mouse lines differentiated by day 4 and were comparably viable ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1E\u2013F ) . Fully differentiated cells are referred to as differentiated in vitro ( DIV ) neutrophils . Like BM-derived neutrophils , DIV neutrophils expressed polymorphonuclear morphology and are cKit- CD11b+ Ly6G+ ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B\u2013D , G\u2013I ) . To confirm the functionality of DIV neutrophils in comparison to BM neutrophils , their ability to generate reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) following integrin and Fc\u03b3 receptor stimulation was assessed ( Chu et al . , 2019 ) . When plated onto surfaces coated with poly-RGD , an engineered polypeptide containing multiple copies of the integrin binding motif , WT BM and DIV neutrophils released superoxide , while Skap2-/-\u00a0BM and DIV neutrophils did not ( Figure 3A\u2013C ) . This is consistent with previously published data in C57BL/6J and Skap2-/-\u00a0BM neutrophils ( Boras et al . , 2017 ) . The loss in integrin-mediated ROS production was not due to defects in the NADPH oxidase itself , as Skap2-/-\u00a0BM and DIV neutrophils robustly released ROS when stimulated with phorbol myristate acetate ( PMA ) , which bypasses receptor-mediated signaling pathways and activates NADPH oxidase via protein kinase C ( PKC ) ( Dang et al . , 2001; Figure 3C ) . By contrast , after stimulation of Fc\u03b3 receptors by IgG immune complexes ( IC ) , WT and Skap2-/-\u00a0BM and DIV neutrophils robustly produced ROS ( Figure 3D\u2013F ) . Skap2-/-\u00a0BM and DIV neutrophils consistently released 60\u201380% as much ROS as compared to levels seen in comparable WT neutrophils . This indicates IC-stimulated ROS is partially dependent on SKAP2 . Differences in ROS production were not due to differences in surface marker expression levels as WT and Skap2-/-\u00a0DIV neutrophils expressed similar levels of integrin and Fc\u03b3 receptors as measured by CD11b and CD16 expression , respectively , by flow cytometry ( Figure 3G\u2013J ) . Combined , these results indicate WT and Skap2-/-\u00a0DIVs phenocopy primary BM neutrophils both morphologically and functionally and are a useful tool to investigate how SKAP2 modulates K . pneumoniae-induced neutrophil responses . Furthermore , these data suggest that a functional NADPH complex can assemble in Skap2-/-\u00a0neutrophils and that SKAP2 is required for receptor-activated signaling pathways downstream of integrin receptors , but not Fc\u03b3 receptors . Multiple neutrophil antimicrobial mechanisms , including degranulation , phagocytosis , and NETs , have been implicated in host defense against K . pneumoniae infection ( Chen et al . , 2016; Ivin et al . , 2017; Papayannopoulos et al . , 2010; Bengoechea and Sa Pessoa , 2019; Paczosa and Mecsas , 2016; Hirche et al . , 2005; Zhao et al . , 2015; Kobayashi et al . , 2016 ) . To examine whether Skap2-/-\u00a0neutrophils degranulated as efficiently as WT neutrophils during K . pneumoniae infection , we measured levels of released MMP-9 and neutrophil elastase ( ELA2 ) , proteins found in tertiary and primary granules , respectively ( Papayannopoulos et al . , 2010; Sheshachalam et al . , 2014 ) . Supernatants from WT and Skap2-/-\u00a0K . pneumoniae-infected lungs had equivalent levels of MMP-9 and ELA2 in Skap2-/-\u00a0at 16 and 24 hpi as detected by ELISA ( Figure 4A\u2013B ) . This suggests that the increased in susceptibility of Skap2-/-\u00a0mice was not due to defects in degranulation . To determine the role of SKAP2 in phagocytosis of K . pneumoniae , phagocytosis was initially measured using microscopy . However , microscopic examination of WT DIV neutrophils infected with GFP-labeled K . pneumoniae and counterstained with Alexa594-conjugated polyvalent \u03b1-K . pneumoniae for extracellular bacteria did not reveal any internalized bacteria indicating that phagocytosis levels were less than 1% ( unpublished data ) . Using a more sensitive gentamicin protection assay ( Walker et al . , 2019 ) , K . pneumoniae 43816 was recovered on average at less than 0 . 01% in WT and Skap2-/-\u00a0DIV neutrophils , while a non-encapsulated ( \u0394cpsB ) K . pneumoniae strain was recovered at approximately 0 . 05% ( Figure 4C ) . This low level was not due to a defect in phagocytosis of DIV neutrophils as WT and Skap2-/-\u00a0DIV neutrophils were able to phagocytose Yersinia pseudotuberculosis YPIII \u0394yscNU strain , a strain that is susceptible to phagocytosis ( Balada-Llasat and Mecsas , 2006 ) . WT and Skap2-/-\u00a0DIV neutrophils phagocytosed 20% and 10% of \u0394yscNU , respectively ( Figure 4C ) , suggesting that phagocytosis of this Y . pseudotuberculosis strain is partially dependent on SKAP2 . Although we observed low level of phagocytosis of K . pneumoniae 43816 , the SKAP2-mediated defect in phagocytosis might be more prominent when challenged with other K . pneumoniae isolates . Combined , these results indicate that the K . pneumoniae 43816 strain is resistant to neutrophil phagocytosis regardless of SKAP2 expression , but can elicit SKAP2-independent degranulation during infection . ROS is an important mechanism for protection against K . pneumoniae as mice that lack the essential gp91phox component of NADPH oxidase , Cybb-/- , were significantly more susceptible to K . pneumoniae infection and had a significant increase in bacterial burden in their lungs ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A; Paczosa et al . , 2020 ) . To test whether SKAP2 deficiency resulted in a defect in neutrophil ROS production after K . pneumoniae infection , an isoluminol-amplified chemiluminiscence assay was used . In contrast to WT BM and DIV neutrophils , neither Skap2-/-\u00a0BM nor DIV neutrophils produced ROS following exposure to K . pneumoniae ( Figure 5A\u2013B; Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B-C ) . The loss of K . pneumoniae-stimulated ROS production was not due to a defect in bacterial-binding as WT and Skap2-/-\u00a0DIV neutrophils bound GFP-labeled K . pneumoniae equivalently when assessed by flow cytometry following both 15- and 30 min incubations ( Figure 5C ) . Without treating the cells with actin inhibitor , such as cytochalasin B , bound and phagocytosed bacteria could contribute to the levels of GFP+ cells . However , the less than 1% of internalization of K . pneumoniae observed in the gentamicin protection assay ( Figure 4C ) suggests that the majority of the bacteria are extracellular , and that GFP+ cells are more likely reflective of binding . Finally , SKAP2 was important for ROS production after infection with another gram-negative bacterial strain , a type 3 deficient Y . pseudotuberculosis strain , \u0394yscF ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1D ) . In summary , Skap2-/-\u00a0neutrophils are defective in triggering the signaling cascade ( s ) required for ROS after K . pneumoniae binding to surface receptors . To investigate how SKAP2 mediates K . pneumoniae-induced ROS production , we first evaluated the requirement for several well-established proteins that are critical for receptor-mediated ROS production after K . pneumoniae infection . Src family kinases ( SFKs ) , Spleen Associated Tyrosine Kinase ( Syk ) , Bruton\u2019s tyrosine kinase ( Btk ) , Phospholipase C\u03b32 ( PLC\u03b32 ) , and PKC play critical roles in receptor-mediated ROS production ( L\u00f6fgren et al . , 1999; Braselmann et al . , 2006; Volmering et al . , 2016; Dang et al . , 2001; Raad et al . , 2009; Kov\u00e1cs et al . , 2014; Fumagalli et al . , 2007; Graham et al . , 2007; Nguyen et al . , 2017 ) . To determine whether these proteins are required for K . pneumoniae-stimulated ROS production , WT DIV neutrophils were pretreated with PP2 , R406 , Ibrutinib , U-73122 , and Go6983 , which are small molecules that inhibit the functions of SFKs , Syk , Btk , PLC\u03b32 , and PKC ( both novel and conventional isoforms ) , respectively ( Figure 5D; Peterman et al . , 2004; Braselmann et al . , 2006; Rol\u00e1n et al . , 2013; Prezzo et al . , 2019; Fumagalli et al . , 2007 ) . The DIV neutrophils were then infected with K . pneumoniae . Pretreatment with PP2 , R406 , Ibrutinib , U-73122 , and Go6983 abolished ROS production after K . pneumoniae infection compared to vehicle-pretreated neutrophils ( Figure 5E ) . As expected , only pretreatment with Go6983 blocked ROS after PMA exposure . U73433 , an U73122 analog that does not target PLC\u03b3 , did not block K . pneumoniae- and PMA-induced ROS ( Figure 5E; Rol\u00e1n et al . , 2013 ) . This suggests SFKs , Syk , Btk , PLC\u03b32 , and PKC are each necessary for K . pneumoniae-activated ROS production . Next , we assessed whether SKAP2 mediates K . pneumoniae-induced ROS production by influencing tyrosine phosphorylated-dependent functions of SFKs and Syk . To determine whether SFKs and Syk are phosphorylated in response to K . pneumoniae infection , western blots of lysates from K . pneumoniae-infected WT DIV neutrophils were probed with phospho-specific antibodies . Infection with K . pneumoniae induced phosphorylation of SFKs ( pSFK ) and Syk ( pSFK ) to levels 2\u20135-fold higher than in unstimulated neutrophils ( Figure 5F\u2013I; Supplementary file 1 ) . These results support findings with inhibitors showing that SFKs and Syk functions are required for K . pneumoniae-activated ROS ( Figure 5E ) . In addition , proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2 ( Pyk2 ) , which is a tyrosine kinase that functions downstream of SFKs and Syk to mediate ROS production ( Kamen et al . , 2011; Zhao and Bokoch , 2005 ) , was phosphorylated in response to K . pneumoniae stimulation ( Figure 5K\u2013L; Supplementary file 1 ) . Thus , signaling circuit ( s ) containing SFKs , Syk , and Pyk2 were activated in neutrophils following receptor binding of K . pneumoniae . To determine if SKAP2 is required for phosphorylation of these tyrosine kinases , the levels of pSFKs , pSyk , and pPyk2 were assessed in Skap2-/-\u00a0DIV neutrophils following K . pneumoniae exposure . While SFKs , Syk , and Pyk2 phosphorylation were all slightly induced in Skap2-/-\u00a0neutrophils , the level of induction was often significantly reduced as compared to WT neutrophils ( Figure 5F\u2013L; Supplementary file 1 ) . To determine if the reduction in phosphorylation was due to decreased cell viability , Skap2-/-\u00a0DIV neutrophils were also stimulated with IC as a control . Stimulation of Fc\u03b3Rs resulted in the phosphorylation for SFKs , Syk , and Pyk2 to similar levels in both WT and Skap2-/-\u00a0DIV neutrophils ( Figure 5F , H , K and Supplementary file 1 ) . Collectively , these results show that SFKs , Syk , and Pyk2 are required for K . pneumoniae-stimulated ROS production , and that the loss of SKAP2 prevents full phosphorylation of SFKs , Syk , and Pyk2 after K . pneumoniae stimulation such that neutrophils are unable to generate ROS production . \n Our experiments reveal that SKAP2 plays a key role in host defense in the hematopoietic compartment against K . pneumoniae 43816 in pulmonary infections in a murine lung model of infection . SKAP2 was indispensable for K . pneumoniae-stimulated neutrophil ROS production , but not degranulation or phagocytosis , suggesting that the increased bacterial burden in the Skap2-/-\u00a0mice is affected by the loss of ROS . Sensitivity of K . pneumoniae to ROS is strongly supported by the increased bacterial burden in Cybb-/- mice during lung infection , and observations in CGD patients ( Wolach et al . , 2017; Paczosa et al . , 2020 ) . In murine neutrophils , SKAP2 was required for full phosphorylation of SFKs , Syk , and Pyk2 , demonstrating a critical role in K . pneumoniae-induced signaling pathways that are required for ROS production . Consistent with previous findings ( Regueiro et al . , 2006; March et al . , 2013 ) , K . pneumoniae 43816 was resistant to internalization indicating that phagocytosis is most likely not the primary protective mechanism provided by neutrophils to this strain . Prior studies , including one using K . pneumoniae 43816 , have shown that degranulation of myeloperoxidase , ELA2 , and cathepsin G are important for reducing bacterial burden of K . pneumoniae in mice ( Hirche et al . , 2005; Zhao et al . , 2015 ) . However , we found that despite equivalent levels of ELA2 , degranulation in Skap2-/-\u00a0mice was not sufficient to control K . pneumoniae burden in the absence of ROS , indicating that neutrophil ROS and degranulation may cooperate in containing K . pneumoniae infection . Since degranulation occurred normally in Skap2-/-\u00a0lungs , the pathways of ROS production are distinct from signaling pathways regulating degranulation in murine neutrophils after K . pneumoniae infection . Neutrophils and ROS contribute to the defense against other pathogens such as Y . pseudotuberculosis , Staphylococcus aureus , Candida albicans , among others ( Green et al . , 2016; M\u00f3csai , 2013; Nguyen et al . , 2017 ) . The immunological mechanisms of SKAP2-mediated neutrophil responses to other pathogens are under investigation . We propose the following model for SKAP2-dependent neutrophilic response to K . pneumoniae in mice based our findings and work of others ( Figure 6; Alenghat et al . , 2012; Swanson et al . , 2008; Togni et al . , 2005; Timms et al . , 1999 ) . Following K . pneumoniae infection , activation of receptors , like GPCRs recognizing N-formylated bacterial proteins or mincle recognizing bacterial lectins , leads to the activation of phosphoinositide 3 kinase ( PI3K ) and the generation of phosphatidylinositol [3 , 4 , 5]-triphosphate ( PIP3 ) , resulting in PIP3-mediated SKAP2 activation and membrane localization ( Figure 6A\u2013B; Futosi et al . , 2013; Swanson et al . , 2008; Sharma et al . , 2014; Alenghat et al . , 2012 ) . The activated ( open ) phosphorylated SKAP2 complex can then bind to and enhance phosphorylation of SFKs shifting their active/inactive equilibrium to more active forms and leading to Syk activation ( Figure 6B; Marie-Cardine et al . , 1998; Bureau et al . , 2018; Kouroku et al . , 1998; Lowell , 2011 ) . This is supported by previous biochemical and pull-down studies showing that SKAP2 can directly interact with SFKs ( Bureau et al . , 2018; Liu et al . , 1998; Wang and Rudd , 2008 ) . SFKs and Syk may directly associate with and activate Pyk2 , as observed in response to GPCRs , integrin , TNF\u03b1 , and/or Salmonella stimulation ( Dikic et al . , 1996; Evangelista et al . , 2007; Han et al . , 2003; M\u00f3csai et al . , 2002 ) . Furthermore , SKAP2 may interact with Pyk2 signaling complex directly or indirectly through their association with Sirp\u03b1 ( Raab et al . , 2017; Alenghat et al . , 2012 ) . Any of these mechanisms would promote stabilization and propagation of SFKs/Syk/Pyk2 phosphorylation in activated murine neutrophil leading to ROS . While SFKs , Syk , and Pyk2 have been shown to be important for degranulation in murine and human neutrophils ( Van Ziffle and Lowell , 2009; Kamen et al . , 2011; M\u00f3csai et al . , 1999; Han et al . , 2003 ) , we observed degranulation in murine lungs and low levels of phosphorylation after K . pneumoniae infection in murine neutrophils in vitro . These low levels may be sufficient to induced degranulation through a SKAP2-independent signaling pathway . Alternatively , specific phosphorylation sites of SFKs or Syk not tested here may still occurred in the absence of SKAP2 and be sufficient to induce degranulation ( Carsetti et al . , 2009; Tsang et al . , 2008; Moroco et al . , 2014; M\u00f3csai et al . , 2010 ) . In addition , different domains of Pyk2 regulate ROS and degranulation ( Han et al . , 2003 ) . Specifically , the inhibition of the carboxy-terminus of Pyk2 in human neutrophils leads to a reduction in ROS production in response to TNF , Salmonella , and Listeria , but did not impair neutrophil degranulation and bacterial killing ( Han et al . , 2003 ) . SKAP2 may impact the carboxy-terminus of Pyk2 in murine neutrophils , but not activation of other domains . Skap2-/- mice have normal levels of circulating neutrophils and Skap2-/-\u00a0neutrophils were present in K . pneumoniae-infected lungs at a similar , and sometimes higher , levels as WT neutrophils ( Figure 1C\u2013D; Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A ) and ( Togni et al . , 2005 ) . However , prior studies revealed that Skap2-/-\u00a0myeloid cells , including\u00a0neutrophils , have impaired recruitment and migration into\u00a0tissues\u00a0during sterile inflammation ( Tanaka et al . , 2016; Boras et al . , 2017 ) . This suggests that migration to sterile , but not infectious sites , may require SKAP2 , which is consistent with findings with Syk . Syk is required for neutrophil migration in an inflammatory model but not during bacterial infection ( Zarbock et al . , 2007; Frommhold et al . , 2007; Van Ziffle and Lowell , 2009; Schymeinsky et al . , 2006 ) . Alternatively , it is possible that Skap2-/-\u00a0neutrophils may have a reduced migration level in K . pneumoniae-infected lungs but this is balanced by significantly higher rate of neutrophil survival and these two factors result in a net neutrophil level that is equivalent to or higher than that observed in WT mice . This result could arise because ROS production can increase myeloid cell death ( Coxon et al . , 1996; Geering and Simon , 2011; Geering et al . , 2011 ) , and thus , defects in ROS production by Skap2-/-\u00a0neutrophils could contribute to higher survival and accumulation in infected murine lungs . These possibilities are important to address with additional experiments , such as pulse-labelling newly differentiated neutrophils to track rates of migration during infection in vivo . Murine models of infection have been helpful in illuminating K . pneumoniae infection biology , however , there exist significant differences between mice and humans in the immune response to infection , including disparities in structural anatomy , circulating neutrophil counts , surface receptors , and signaling cascades , among others ( Mizgerd and Skerrett , 2008; Mestas and Hughes , 2004; Condliffe et al . , 2005; Hajjar et al . , 2010; Sun et al . , 2016; Bagaitkar et al . , 2012; Bengoechea and Sa Pessoa , 2019 ) . Thus , to date it is unknown if SKAP2 plays a role in mediating the\u00a0human neutrophil response to K . pneumoniae infection . Skap2 has 9 transcripts and at least 50 exonic variants that have been reported in the human population , however , their functional consequences , if any , remains unclear ( Cunningham et al . , 2019 ) . It would be interesting to explore if the SKAP2-mediated K . pneumoniae-stimulated responses occur in human neutrophils , and whether neutrophils ( or other cell types ) from individuals carrying specific Skap2 variants respond differently K . pneumoniae 43816 infection . In addition , it is unclear whether our results with K . pneumoniae 43816 will be found with other K2 strains or strains of other serotypes . Genome-wide analyses of K . pneumoniae clinical isolates have shown extensive genetic diversity , virulence factors , and pathogenicity ( Holt et al . , 2015; Deleo et al . , 2014; Agard et al . , 2019 ) . Furthermore , since neutrophils are not the major player in host defenses against all strains of K . pneumoniae , including some multi-drug resistant clinical isolates ( Xiong et al . , 2016; Xiong et al . , 2015; Broug-Holub et al . , 1997; Greenberger et al . , 1996 ) , future studies can use these K . pneumoniae strains to probe the role of SKAP2 in neutrophils as well as other hematopoietic cells during K . pneumoniae infections . In summary , neutrophils and their production of ROS play a dual role in host health in many disease states from acute infections to autoimmune diseases to cancer ( Hoffmann and Griffiths , 2018; Nguyen et al . , 2017 ) , and the crucial function of SKAP2-mediated ROS in murine neutrophils suggests that further analysis of the role of SKAP2 in human health warrants investigation . \n BALB/c and C57BL/6J mice were purchased from Taconic Biosciences and Jackson laboratory ( Bar Harbor , ME ) , respectively . Mating pairs of Cybb-/- in C57BL/6J background , and Skap2+/- ( B6 . 129S5-Skap2Gt ( VICTR20 ) 21Lex/Mmjax ) were purchased from Jackson laboratory and bred at Tufts University in the specific pathogen-free facility of Tufts University . Generation of Skap2-/-\u00a0mice in the BALB/c background was previously described ( Togni et al . , 2005; Alenghat et al . , 2012 ) . Skap2-/-\u00a0mice were genotyped by two independent PCRs using primer sequences: SkapLeft-forward primer ( common for both PCRs ) , 5\u2019 CAG CTT GCC GAC TTT TCT; GTLexVir , 5\u2019GAG GGC TGG ACC GCA TCT GG; GTSkapRight , 5\u2019CCG CCT CCC ACC CCT CAA TC following procedures described from Jackson laboratory and ( Alenghat et al . , 2012 ) . All mice were handled in accordance with protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Tufts University . Mouse infections were carried out as previously described ( Paczosa et al . , 2020; Silver et al . , 2019 ) with the following modifications . MKP220 , streptomycin-resistant derivative of K . pneumoniae ATCC43816 strain was used for all infections ( Paczosa et al . , 2020; Silver et al . , 2019 ) . Isoflurane anesthetized mice on a BALB/c background were intranasally infected dropwise with 5 \u00d7 103 cfu K . pneumoniae in 40 \u03bcl of sterile PBS , or with PBS ( Fisher Scientific ) alone . C57BL/6J mice were inoculated retropharyngeally with 5 \u00d7 103 cfu as previously described ( Paczosa et al . , 2020 ) . This change in infection route was because we have found that if delivered intranasally , C57BL/6J mice will rapidly dispel the inoculum through their nose and mouth\u00a0resulting\u00a0in inconsistent infection . Mice were euthanized using CO2 asphyxiation at the indicated time points after infection . Lungs were collected into sterile PBS , weighed , and aseptically homogenized by pushing the tissue through a 70 \u03bcM cell strainer . For bacterial burden analyses , serially diluted homogenates were plated on L-agar and incubated at 37\u00b0C overnight to determine CFU/g lung . For depletion of neutrophils or iMOs , mice were intraperitoneally injecting 100 \u03bcl of 50 \u03bcg/ml \u03b1-Ly6G antibody ( clone: 1A8 , Fisher Scientific ) , or 100 \u03bcl of 200 \u03bcg/ml \u03b1-MC21 antibody 16 hr pre-infection . Depletion efficiency was measured by flow cytometry as described below . Collection of bronchoalveolar lavage was conducted as previously described ( Silver et al . , 2019 ) . 4\u20135 week-old BALB/c and Skap2-/-\u00a0mice received 100 mg/kg/24 hr SulfaTrim available ad libitum in drinking water for a week prior to and a week following whole body irradiation . Mice were lethally irradiated with 2 doses of 4 . 5 G\u03b3 with a 3\u20134 hr interval between doses . The next day , each mouse intravenously received 100 \u03bcl of sterile PBS containing 5 \u00d7 106 BM cells from either BALB/c or Skap2-/-\u00a0donor mice ( 7\u201315 week-old ) and were infected with K . pneumoniae 4\u20135 weeks later . For histological studies , lungs from mock or K . pneumoniae-infected mice were perfused through a tracheal incision using 4% formaldehyde ( MP Biomedicals ) , removed , and incubated in fresh 4% formaldehyde overnight at room temperature ( RT ) . Excess fatty tissues were removed , and lungs were placed in histology cassettes for processing by the Tufts Animal Pathology Core . Tissues were embedded in paraffin and 7 \u03bcM thick sections were sliced and stained with hematoxylin and eosin ( HE ) . Sections were blindly scored for number of areas of leukocyte infiltration and detectable bacteria by 4\u20137 individuals with at least 3 lung sections per mouse using light microscopy . Three PBS-inoculated and 5 K . pneumoniae-infected mice were scored per genotype . Tissues were imaged using an Echo Revolve R4 microscope in the upright brightfield configuration at 4x ( NA 0 . 13 ) or 40x ( NA 0 . 75 ) magnification and acquired at RT using a 12 MP CMOS color camera and the Echo Revolve built-in software . After passage of lung tissues through 70 \u03bcm strainers , the cell suspensions were centrifuged at 13 , 000 x g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C . Supernatants were then transferred into new Eppendorf tubes for measurement of release of matrix metalloproteinase ( MMP-9 ) , and neutrophil elastase ( ELA-2 ) by DuoSet ELISA kits ( R and D Systems ) per manufacturer\u2019s protocols . After passage of lung tissues through a 70 \u03bcm strainer , cell suspensions were treated with 1 mg/ml Collagenase D ( ThermoFisher Scientific ) for 1 hr at 37\u00b0C , and then with 1X Pharm Lyse ( Fisher Scientific ) for 5 min at 4\u00b0C . Cells were resuspended in ice-cold fluorescence-activated cell sorter ( FACS ) buffer ( PBS containing 1% FBS ) , and blocked with rat anti-mouse CD16/CD32 ( Mouse BD Fc Block BD Biosciences ) for 10 min at 4\u00b0C . For time courses , cells were stained with \u03b1-CD11b-PE ( BioLegend ) , \u03b1-Ly6G PE-Cy7 ( BioLegend ) , \u03b1-CD11c-PerCP-Cy5 . 5 ( BD Biosciences ) , and \u03b1-Gr1-FITC ( BioLegend ) for analysis of neutrophils ( CD11b+ Ly6G+ ) , alveolar macrophages ( CD11bint CD11chi ) , resident monocytes ( CD11b+ Gr1lo ) , and dendritic cells ( CD11bhi CD11chi ) . For bone marrow chimeric and depletion experiments , lung cells were stained with \u03b1-CD11b-PacBlue ( BioLegend ) , \u03b1-Ly6G-PE-Cy7 ( BioLegend ) , \u03b1-Gr1-APC ( BioLegend ) , and \u03b1-Ly6C-AlexaFluor647 ( BioLegend ) for analysis of neutrophils and inflammatory monocytes as indicated in figure legends . For some experiments , cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde , permeabilized with 0 . 1% saponin , and intracellularly stained with \u03b1-SKAP2 ( Proteintech ) or rabbit IgG polyclonal isotype antibody ( Proteintech ) , followed by goat anti-rabbit\u00a0AlexaFluor488\u00a0secondary antibody ( ThermoFisher Scientific ) . Data were collected by a BD LSRII , and analyzed with FlowJo ( version 10 . 1 ) . Mouse BM neutrophils were isolated as previously described ( Rol\u00e1n et al . , 2013 ) with the following modifications . Neutrophils were isolated using a three step Percoll density gradient ( 55% , 65% , and 75% ) , and centrifuged at 480 x g for 30 min at 26\u00b0C without applying the break . Neutrophils were collected at the 65\u201375% interface , resuspended in HBSS without Ca2+ or Mg2+ ( HBSS- ) , then centrifuged at 250 x g for 5 min at RT to wash and pellet the cells . Supernatants were removed and cells were resuspended in HBSS- and centrifuged for a total of three washes . Neutrophils were rested at RT for one hour , resuspended in HBSS with Ca2+ and Mg2+ ( HBSS+ ) to the desired concentration , incubated at RT for 20 min , and then shifted to 37\u00b0C for 10 min prior to the experiment . The purity of neutrophil preparations was verified by staining an aliquot of the cells with \u03b1-CD11b-PacBlu , \u03b1-Ly6G-PE-Cy7 , and \u03b1-Gr1-APC and analyzed by flow cytometry . Immortalization of murine BM cells with ER-HoxB8 was done as previously described ( Wang et al . , 2006 ) with the following modifications . Bone marrow stem cells were collected from the tibias and femurs of mice and passed through a 40 \u03bcm filter . Cells were layered over Ficoll-Paque-Plus ( Pharmacia ) , and centrifuged at 400 x g for 25 min at RT without applying the break to enrich for mononuclear cells . These cells were incubated in a 6-well tissue culture plate ( Greiner Bio-One ) for 24 hr at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2 prior to the retroviral transduction in complete RPMI , cRPMI ( RPMI-1640 with 10% FBS , 2 mM L-glutamine , and 100U penicillin and 0 . 1 mg/ml streptomycin ) , supplemented with 10 ng/ml stem cell factor ( SCF ) , 10 ng/ml interleukin-3 ( IL-3 ) , and 10 ng/ml interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) . The next day , non-adherent cells were harvested and 5 \u00d7 105 cells in 500 \u03bcl of cRPMI were plated onto a 12-well tissue culture plate ( Corning ) coated with 10 \u03bcg/ml human fibronectin ( Sigma ) . Retroviral supernatant ( MSCVneo-HA-ER-Hoxb8 ) was applied in the presence of 8 \u03bcg/ml polybrene and the plates were centrifuged for \u2018spinoculation\u2019 at 1000 x g for 90 min at RT . Following spin infection , cells were maintained in cRPMI supplemented with 0 . 5 \u03bcM beta-estradiol ( Sigma , E2 ) and conditioned media containing approximately 50 ng/ml SCF ( SCF + E2 cRPMI ) . Cells were maintained for 3\u20134 weeks to select for ER-HoxB8-carrying granulocyte-monocyte progenitor cells . Uninfected cells were maintained alongside as controls and all died by 4 weeks . To confirm the identify of cell lines , we assessed for SKAP2 protein expression by intracellular staining or western blotting . Mycoplasma testing of cultured lines was conducted at 3\u20136 month intervals using e-Myco Mycoplasma PCR Detection Kit ( Bulldog Bio ) . ER-HoxB8 stem cell lines were grown in E2 + SCF cRPMI . Differentiation into neutrophils was done as previously described ( Wang et al . , 2006; Pelletier et al . , 2017 ) with the following modifications . Aliquots of ER-HoxB8 progenitors were washed 3 times in PBS and cultured in E2-free cRPMI media supplemented with\u00a0~50 ng/ml SCF , IL-3 , and GCSF for two days . Cells were then restimulated with 50 ng/ml GCSF for another 48 hr . At this point , cells were differentiated and termed DIV neutrophils . DIV neutrophils were collected , pelleted at 250 x g for 5 min at 4\u00b0C , re-suspended in HBSS- and rested for 1 hr at RT . DIV neutrophils were re-suspended in HBSS+ to the desired concentration , incubated at RT for 20 min , and then shifted to 37\u00b0C for 10 min for functional assays . DAPI staining and flow cytometry were performed to confirm that\u00a0>90% of cells were neutrophils . An aliquot of 1 \u00d7 105 BM and DIV neutrophils were spun onto microscope slide using Shannon Cytospin 3 , fixed with 4% formaldehyde , stained with DAPI ( ThermoFisher Scientific ) , and mounted using ProLong Gold antifade reagent ( Invitrogen ) . Cell morphology was imaged at 60X by an Echo Revolve R4 microscope in the upright fluorescent configuration . Aliquots of cells were resuspended in cold FACS buffer and blocked with Mouse BD Fc Block ( BioLegend ) for 10 min at 4\u00b0C . Cells were then stained with \u03b1-CD11b-PacBlu , \u03b1-Ly6G-PE-Cy7 , and \u03b1-cKit-PE , and then fixed with 4% formaldehyde prior to analysis . Viability was assessed using trypan blue ( Gibco ) exclusion test immediately prior to functional studies to confirm that\u00a0>85% of cells were live and all counts were based on live cells . In addition , an ATP-based assay , Promega CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell viability Assay , was conducted during the time course of several experiments to assess viability per instructor\u2019s instructions ( Promega ) ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1E-F ) . Neutrophils ( 1 \u00d7 105 cells/well ) and green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) -labeled K . pneumoniae ( MOI 40 ) were added to non-tissue-treated 96-well plates ( CellTreat ) , centrifuged at 250 x g for 3 min , and then incubated for 30 min at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2 for 15 or 30 min . Cells were then harvested , centrifuged at 250 x g for 5 min , and resuspended in 200 ul/well ice-cold FACS buffer; this was repeated for a total of 3 washes . Cells were then fixed with 4% formaldehyde , and nuclei were stained with DAPI . The percentage of K . pneumoniae-associated neutrophils was determined by flow cytometry using uninfected neutrophils as control . K . pneumoniae MKP220 and a isogenic non-encapsulated \u0394cpsB strain ( Paczosa et al . , 2020; Silver et al . , 2019 ) were grown overnight in LB media at 37\u00b0C with aeration , and the next day diluted 1:40 into fresh LB media and grown for an additional 2 hr at 37\u00b0C with aeration . The Y . pseudotuberculosis YPIII \u0394yscNU strain ( Balada-Llasat and Mecsas , 2006 ) was grown in 2XYT at 26\u00b0C with aeration . K . pneumoniae and Y . pseudotuberculosis were then used to infect 1 \u00d7 105 DIV neutrophils at an MOI of 10 for 30 min at 37\u00b0C in the presence of 5% CO2 in 96-well 4HBX plates pre-coated with 10% FBS , and then 100 \u03bcg/ml gentamicin was added to wells for 1 hr at 37\u00b0C to kill extracellular bacteria . Control FBS-coated wells contained bacteria but no neutrophils and were not treated with gentamicin ( non-gentamicin-treated wells ) . All following steps were conducted at 4\u00b0C . Cold PBS was added to the wells; plates were centrifuged at 250 x g for 5 min , and all media were gently removed; this was repeated for a total of four washes . All wells were treated with 0 . 1% Triton X-100 ( Sigma-Aldrich ) for 10 min at 4\u00b0C , and then serially diluted and plated to quantify surviving bacteria . The percent of phagocytosis was calculated as ( # of bacteria with neutrophils from gentamicin-treated wells ) / ( # of bacteria from non-gentamicin-treated wells ) . High-bound tissue-treated 4HBX 96-well plates ( Fisher Scientific ) were used for all ROS assays . Plates were prepared as follows . For integrin activation , wells were coated with 15 \u03bcg/ml poly-RGD ( Sigma ) for 2 hr at 37\u00b0C or overnight at RT . For Fc\u03b3 receptor activation by IgG immune complexes ( IC ) , wells were coated with 20 \u03bcg/ml human serum albumin ( Sigma ) for 1 hr , washed twice with PBS , blocked with 10% FBS for 30 min , washed twice with PBS , and incubated with anti-human serum albumin ( Sigma ) at 1:400 dilution in 10% FBS for 1 hr at 37\u00b0C . Control wells were coated with 10% FBS for 30 min at 37\u00b0C . All wells were washed twice with PBS prior to use . For experiments with K . pneumoniae , wells were coated with 10% FBS for 30 min at 37\u00b0C and washed twice with PBS prior to use . For all ROS assays , 100 nM of PMA was used as positive control . To evaluate whether Skap2-/-\u00a0neutrophils generated ROS after infection with another species of bacteria , a Y . pseudotuberculosis YPIII type 3 secretion mutant , \u0394yscF was used ( Green et al . , 2016 ) . To detect RGD or IgG IC-stimulated ROS , superoxide detection by cytochrome C ( Sigma ) was performed as previously described ( Lowell et al . , 1996 ) with the following modifications . Cytochrome C was added to each well at a final concentration of 100 \u03bcM and 1 \u00d7 105 neutrophils were added to each well coated with either FBS or ligand . Absorbance at 490 nm and 550 nm were recorded at 37\u00b0C using Biotek Synergy HT . Superoxide concentration was calculated by ( OD550-OD490 ) x ( 2 . 11 \u00d7 104 M\u22121cm\u22121 ) , which is the extinction coefficient of cytochrome C ( Dahlgren et al . , 2007 ) . Total superoxide production was calculated by the sum of the area under the curves for the indicated time . To detect ROS production following K . pneumoniae exposure , isoluminol was performed as previously described ( Kobayashi et al . , 2016; Dahlgren et al . , 2007 ) with the following modifications . Neutrophils resuspended in HBSS+ , rested at RT for 30 min , were loaded with 50 \u03bcM isoluminol ( Sigma ) and 15 U/ml HRP ( Sigma ) , added to a 96-well plate at 1 \u00d7 105 cells/well , and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 10 min . K . pneumoniae ( grown as described in gentamicin protection assays ) were then added to wells at a MOI of 2 . 5 or 5 , and the plate was centrifuged at 500 x g for 3 min at 4\u00b0C . For inhibitor studies , following isoluminol and HRP loading , DIV neutrophils were pre-treated with 10 nM PP2 ( Selleck Chemical ) , 2 \u03bcM R406 ( Selleck Chemical ) , 1 \u03bcM Ibrutinib ( Selleck Chemical ) , 10 \u03bcM Go 6983 ( Abcam ) , 1 \u03bcM U-73122 ( Sigma ) , 1 \u03bcM U-73433 ( Sigma ) , or DMSO ( 1:10 , 000 final concentration , Sigma ) vehicle control for 10 min at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2 . A BioTek Synergy HT late reader was used to detect chemiluminescence ( RLU ) . Total ROS ( total RLU ) production was calculated by the sum of the area under the curves for the indicated time in figure legends . DIV neutrophils ( 7 . 5 \u00d7 105 cells/well ) in HBSS+ were plated onto 96-well 4HBX plates coated with 10% FBS . K . pneumoniae was added at MOI 40 and spun at 250 x g for 2 min . Cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C in presence of 5% CO2 for 10 or 15 min , lysed in 1X Novex buffer ( 4X stock: 40% sucrose , 6 . 82% Tris-Base , 6 . 66% Tris-HCL , 8% SDS , 0 . 06% EDTA , 0 . 075% Bromophenol Blue , 2 . 5 mM NaVO4 , 100 mM DTT ) and 5\u20137 . 5 \u00d7 105 cells equivalents were resolved on 4\u201312% NuPAGE gel ( Invitrogen ) in MOPS buffer ( 10 . 5% MOPS , 6% Tris-Base , 5% SDS , 0 . 3% EDTA ) . Proteins were transferred to Immobilon-FL PVDF ( Millipore Sigma ) and subjected to western blot analysis using antibodies at a dilution of 1:500 unless otherwise indicated . Antibodies to phosphorylated proteins include Src Family-Y416 ( Cell Signaling Technology ) , Syk-Y352 ( Cell Signaling Technology ) and Pyk2-Y402 ( Cell Signaling Technology ) . All blots were also probed with RhoGDI ( Cell Signaling Technology ) at a dilution of 1:1000 as loading control . Secondary LI-COR goat anti-mouse IRDye 800 CW ( Cell Signaling Technology ) and goat anti-rabbit IRDye 800 CW ( Cell Signaling Technology ) were used at a dilution of 1:20 , 000 . The Odyssey CLx LI-COR system was used to develop the blots and IS Image Studio was used for analysis and quantification of bands . Blots were then stripped with 7M Guanine Hydrochloride ( Fisher Scientific ) by incubating at 56\u00b0C for 30 min with shaking , washed 3 times in 1x TBST ( 0 . 1% Tween-20 in 1x TBS ) , and reprobed with antibodies for total proteins against Syk and Pyk2 ( Cell Signaling Technology ) . The normalized protein level of pSFKs was calculated by taking the ratio of phosphorylated protein to RhoGDI loading control . The normalized protein levels of pSyk and pPyk2 were calculated by first taking the ratio of phosphorylated to total protein and then normalizing to the RhoGDI loading control . Normalized phospho-protein levels were used to calculate the fold change to unstimulated ( 0 min ) control within each group , or to unstimulated control of WT ( Supplementary file 1 ) . In addition , the relative induction of phosphorylation in unstimulated controls was determined by dividing the fold change of each experiment by the average of the three experiments . Fold change was log transformed and subjected to statistical analysis . Differences between the groups were evaluated by one-way ANOVA or two-way ANOVA with either Tukey\u2019s or Sidak\u2019s post-test , where appropriate ( GraphPad Software version 7 ) . Log-transformed values were used for determining significance in experiments measuring CFU .", "headings": ["Abstract", "Introduction", "Results", "Discussion", "Materials and methods"], "keywords": ["microbiology and infectious disease", "immunology and inflammation"], "id": "elife-56656-v2"}
{"lay_summary": "Malaria is one of the world's most deadly infections , causing 100s of 1000s of deaths each year despite being both preventable and curable . Malaria is caused by Plasmodium parasites , which are transmitted between humans by mosquitoes . When a mosquito bites a human , Plasmodium is injected into the bloodstream with the mosquito's saliva . The parasite then travels through the bloodstream to the liver , infects liver cells and multiplies within those cells without causing any noticeable symptoms . After remaining silent in the liver for weeks or months , the now abundant parasite ruptures the host liver cell , re-enters the bloodstream , and begins infecting red blood cells . If another mosquito bites the infected individual and takes a blood meal , the parasite moves into the mosquito and the cycle of transmission continues . There are several species of Plasmodium that are known to cause malaria . The most widely studied species is P . falciparum , which also causes one of the deadliest types of malaria . However , another Plasmodium species called P . vivax is the most widely distributed species and , despite being less virulent than P . falciparum , is particularly dangerous because it causes recurring malaria . In contrast to P . falciparum , P . vivax has the ability to form hypnozoites: a dormant form of the parasite that can remain inside liver cells for long periods of time , sometimes for years . The reservoir of P . vivax hypnozoites can regularly populate the bloodstream with the infectious form of the parasite , triggering relapses of malaria . Even if an individual suffering a relapse receives prompt treatment to clear parasites in the blood , more parasites may emerge from the liver and cause new blood-stage infections . White et al . developed a mathematical model to help understand how P . vivax is transmitted . Unlike many of the established models of malaria transmission , the new model accounts for the reservoir of P . vivax hypnozoites in the liver , and assumes that hypnozoites in the reservoir either die , or are activated and enter the bloodstream , at a constant rate . This produces patterns that closely match how often relapses occur in patients . White et al . go on to predict that although many infected people have few or no hypnozoites in their liver , some have many hypnozoites , and these people are more likely to suffer from malaria relapses . This suggests that if the initial treatments given to malaria sufferers incorporate additional drugs that kill the hypnozoites in the liver , then it may be possible to substantially reduce the extent of P . vivax transmission .", "article": "Plasmodium vivax relapse infections occur following activation of latent liver-stages parasites ( hypnozoites ) causing new blood-stage infections weeks to months after the initial infection . We develop a within-host mathematical model of liver-stage hypnozoites , and validate it against data from tropical strains of P . vivax . The within-host model is embedded in a P . vivax transmission model to demonstrate the build-up of the hypnozoite reservoir following new infections and its depletion through hypnozoite activation and death . The hypnozoite reservoir is predicted to be over-dispersed with many individuals having few or no hypnozoites , and some having intensely infected livers . Individuals with more hypnozoites are predicted to experience more relapses and contribute more to onwards P . vivax transmission . Incorporating hypnozoite killing drugs such as primaquine into first-line treatment regimens is predicted to cause substantial reductions in P . vivax transmission as individuals with the most hypnozoites are more likely to relapse and be targeted for treatment . \n The study of the transmission dynamics of vector-borne diseases such as Plasmodium falciparum malaria has a rich history , with a theoretical foundation based on the Ross-Macdonald models ( malERA Consultative Group on Modeling , 2011; Smith et al . , 2012; Reiner et al . , 2013; Smith et al . , 2014 ) , a class of mathematical models describing the transmission of a pathogen between human and vector hosts . In the case of P . falciparum , the parasite has a reservoir in both the human host and the Anopheles mosquito , with transmission occurring when a mosquito takes a blood meal from a human . Ross-Macdonald models have provided insights into the dynamics of P . falciparum transmission resulting in valuable guidance for historical and contemporary malaria control programmes , most notably the large reductions in transmission that are achievable if the lifespan of the mosquito is reduced through vector control ( Macdonald , 1952a; Macdonald , 1952b ) . In contrast to the extensive theory of the mathematical epidemiology of P . falciparum malaria ( Smith et al . , 2012 ) , P . vivax malaria has been comparatively neglected . This is in spite of P . vivax being the geographically most widely distributed species of malaria in the world , causing in the region of 80\u2013300 million clinical episodes every year ( Mueller et al . , 2009a; Gething et al . , 2012 ) . P . falciparum models are not applicable to P . vivax as they fail to account for the reservoir of dormant liver stages ( hypnozoites ) which give rise to relapsing infections\u2014one of the defining characteristics of the biology and epidemiology of P . vivax ( Mueller et al . , 2009a ) . In natural transmission settings relapses are often undistinguishable from re-infections from new mosquito bites or recrudescences of existing blood-stage infections . When the origin of renewed parasitemia following primary P . vivax infection is unknown , it can be classified as a recurrent infection ( Battle et al . , 2014 ) . Most existing models of malaria transmission do not account for the additional reservoir of parasites in the liver , but the hypnozoite reservoir has been incorporated into some P . vivax transmission models as a state to denote hypnozoite infection ( Ishikawa et al . , 2003; Chamchod and Beier , 2013; Roy et al . , 2013 ) or as up to two broods of hypnozoites ( Dezoysa et al . , 1991 ) . Relapse patterns and their implications for transmission have also been investigated using statistical distributions for the time to first relapse ( Lover et al . , 2014 ) . Here we advance on existing work by considering how the number of hypnozoites in the liver contributes to patterns of relapse infections and the epidemiology and control of P . vivax . When a P . vivax infected mosquito takes a blood meal from a human , sporozoites are injected into the skin and migrate to the liver , where they invade hepatocytes and develop into either actively dividing schizonts or dormant hypnozoites . The development of actively dividing schizonts may lead to a primary blood-stage infection and potentially clinical malaria ( Mueller et al . , 2013 ) . Hypnozoites will lie dormant in the liver for weeks to years before activating to initiate new blood-stage infections . The biological mechanisms regulating the activation of hypnozoites remain unknown ( Mueller et al . , 2009a ) , although a number of triggers for relapses have been proposed , including fever caused by other pathogens such as P . falciparum ( Shanks and White , 2013 ) and exposure to Anopheles-specific proteins ( Hulden and Hulden , 2011 ) . There is considerable geographical variation in the timing and frequency of P . vivax relapse infections , with strains from tropical areas having an average time to first relapse of 3\u20136 weeks and long-latency strains from temperate areas relapsing within 6\u20139 months ( Lover and Coker , 2013; Battle et al . , 2014 ) . Beyond the first relapse , periodic patterns in multiple relapses from a single mosquito bite have been observed ( White , 2011 ) . For example , following a single infection with a tropical strain of P . vivax the time until next relapse has been observed to increase with each successive relapse ( Berliner et al . , 1948; White , 2011 ) . In contrast , temperate strains are associated with a long latency period until first relapse ( of the order of 6 months ) followed by short intervals between successive relapses ( Coatney et al . , 1950; Hankey et al . , 1953; White , 2011 ) . A descriptive epidemiology of P . vivax relapses will thus require estimation of three key quantities: ( i ) the time to first relapse , ( ii ) the number of relapses per primary infection , and ( iii ) the duration of hypnozoite carriage . In this manuscript , a within-host model of hypnozoites in liver hepatocytes is developed to demonstrate that many of the epidemiological patterns of relapse infections can be explained by making the assumption that hypnozoites activate and die at a constant rate . This model is integrated into the existing theory of Ross-Macdonald models to account for the relapse infections characteristic of P . vivax malaria . We use this model to provide qualitative insights into the relative contribution of relapses to P . vivax transmission and illustrate the consequences for controlling P . vivax with vector control and anti-malarial drugs . \n Figure 1 shows the best fit within-host relapse model to data on time to first relapse infection from three ecological zones with tropical strains of P . vivax: South America , South East Asia and Melanesia ( Battle et al . , 2014 ) . In each ecological zone , the number of hypnozoites N and the hypnozoite activation rate \u03b1 were correlated ( see Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . For example , a short time to relapse could be explained by a single fast activating hypnozoite or a large number of slow activating hypnozoites . Longitudinal data where multiple relapses are observed in individuals would allow better estimation of the number of hypnozoites in the liver and the duration of hypnozoite carriage . 10 . 7554/eLife . 04692 . 003Figure 1 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 04692 . 004 The within-host model can be used to simulate beyond the first relapse infection . Figure 2 shows some sample relapse patterns from the within-host models for tropical and temperate strains of P . vivax . This model predicts notable dose-dependency with increased numbers of hypnozoites associated with a greater number of relapses and shorter time to first relapse . Following the long latency to first relapse in temperate strains , the interval between subsequent relapses is considerably shorter . The within-host model assumes that hypnozoites act independently of each other , and hence the time to next relapsing hypnozoite is exponentially distributed . In particular we do not predict periodicity between relapsing hypnozoites ( in the absence of external triggers [White , 2011; Shanks and White , 2013] ) . If the simulated data are censored such that relapses occurring within 14 days of a previous relapse remain undetected ( due to either prophylaxis by blood-stage anti-malarials or the presence of parasites from an existing infection ) then there is an apparent periodicity in detected relapses . The observed periodicity of relapses will be determined by the duration of prophylactic protection and not via the biological mechanisms considered here . The periodicity in detected relapses is most evident for large numbers of hypnozoites with the period being determined by the assumed duration of prophylactic protection ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . However , as has been previously argued , periodicity in relapses could also be attributable to a cycle of fevers initiating hypnozoite activation which in turn cause new blood-stage infections and malaria-associated fevers ( White , 2011 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 04692 . 005Figure 2 . Sample relapse patterns for tropical and temperate strains of P . vivax . A relapse is assumed to be undetected if it occurs within 14 days of a detected relapse . Both tropical and temperate phenotypes exhibit dose dependency , with a larger number of hypnozoites giving rise to a greater number of relapses and shorter times to first relapse . For larger numbers of hypnozoites ( N = 50 ) , periodicity in detected relapses is observed . The appearance of this periodicity is due to the undetected relapses .

For the temperate phenotype the time between relapses was calculated as the mean duration between consecutive relapses over the first 12 months based on 10 , 000 stochastic simulations . The red curves denote the time between detected relapses: it is assumed that within 14 days of a detected relapse some activating hypnozoites can go undetected due to anti-malarial prophylaxis or the presence of blood-stage parasites . The grey curve denotes the expected time between all consecutively activating hypnozoites . The dashed line denotes a 3 week duration which has been regularly been observed as a common period between consecutive relapses ( White , 2011 ) . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 04692 . 006 Figure 3 shows the predicted number of relapsing hypnozoites in a population exposed to P . vivax in the absence of new infections . For tropical strains the mean number of hypnozoites in the liver is expected to decrease exponentially , but the proportion of individuals carrying hypnozoites is expected to decrease at a slower rate as an individual can relapse even if they have just one hypnozoite ( Figure 3A ) . For temperate strains the mean number of hypnozoites in the liver decreases slowly , as hypnozoites remain in the long-latency phase for approximately 6 months ( Figure 3B ) . The model allows estimation of time to second , third and consecutive relapses in addition to estimates of time to first relapse obtainable via survival analysis of patient data ( Lover and Coker , 2013; Battle et al . , 2014 ) ( Figure 3C , D ) . The expected number of relapsing hypnozoites per individual is expected to follow an approximately exponential distribution ( Figure 3E , F ) in agreement with empirical observations ( Horing , 1947; White , 2011 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 04692 . 007Figure 3 .

EIR is a measurement of the number of infectious bites per person per year . The proportion of people infected with hypnozoites is predicted to be higher than the proportion infected with P . vivax blood-stage parasites . For a given EIR , P . vivax blood-stage prevalence is predicted to be higher than P . falciparum prevalence as a single mosquito bite can give rise to multiple blood-stage infections . However this does not account for the longer duration of P . falciparum infections as a consequence of antigenic switching ( Molineaux et al . , 2001 ) , and the important role of heterogeneity in exposure ( Smith et al . , 2005 ) . With the exception of the P . vivax hypnozoite rate , these quantities can be measured in epidemiological field studies ( Smith et al . , 2005; Kelly-Hope and McKenzie , 2009 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 04692 . 008Figure 4 .

The black line denotes the median number of hypnozoites , and the shaded areas denote the 50% and 95% ranges . ( C ) The distribution of the hypnozoite reservoir when PvPR = 50% . The grey bar represents individuals with zero hypnozoites . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 04692 . 008 Figure 4B shows how the median number of hypnozoites increases with increasing P . vivax transmission . Figure 4C shows the distribution in the number of hypnozoites when PvPR = 50% . The number of hypnozoites per individual is predicted to be over-dispersed following a negative binomial distribution . Thus some individuals will harbour a large number of hypnozoites while some will have none . This phenomenon will be further amplified if there is heterogeneity in exposure where some individuals receive a large number of mosquito bites . The impact of malaria control interventions will depend on how effectively the parasite is targeted in each of the reservoirs in the mosquito , the blood and the liver . Figure 5 shows the qualitative effects of malaria control on the transmission dynamics of P . falciparum and P . vivax . Vector control with insecticide treated nets ( ITNs ) or indoor residual spraying ( IRS ) is assumed to increase mosquito mortality . The introduction of vector control is expected to cause a rapid decline in P . falciparum parasite rate ( PfPR ) , and a smaller and slower decline in P . vivax ( Figure 5A ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 04692 . 009Figure 5 .

Transmission model incorporating treatment of new infections with blood-stage anti-malarials . Treatment coverage \u03c7 is assumed , that is , the proportion of new blood-stage infections that receive treatment with blood-stage anti-malarials . There will be a delay between the emergence of parasites into the blood-stream and the administration of treatment following symptoms . This stage is described by treatment compartment Ti and lasts 1/\u03bd = 7 days . Importantly , transmission to mosquitoes is possible during this stage as P . vivax gametocytes ( the sexual stage of the parasite that can be transmitted to mosquitoes ) are present in the blood very early on in the infection . Following treatment , individuals progress to a period of prophylactic protection Pi , during which they are not susceptible to new blood-stage infections but may still acquire hypnozoites from new bites from infectious mosquitoes . It is assumed that individuals remain under prophylactic protection for 1/\u03be = 14 days after which they return to being susceptible Si .

Transmission model incorporating treatment of new infections with blood-stage anti-malarials and primaquine . The incorporation of primaquine into first-line treatment regimens is accounted for by assuming that treatment clears all hypnozoites from the liver as well as clearing blood-stage infections . A 14 day daily dosing regimen of primaquine which has proven efficacy at preventing relapses . In particular we assume treatment eliminates all hypnozoites , so that treated individuals move to compartment P0 ( under prophylaxis from treatment and with all hypnozoites removed ) . The 14 day treatment regimen is assumed to provide a period of prophylactic protection against new hypnozoite infection , that is , new hypnozoites cannot be acquired while primaquine is being administered . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 04692 . 011 Figure 5B shows the effect of targeting the parasite reservoir in the blood by providing first-line treatment for new blood-stage infections with anti-malarial drugs such as chloroquine or artemisinin combination therapies ( ACTs ) . See details of how treatment was implemented in the model are provided in Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1 , 2 . Increasing treatment coverage leads to reductions in blood-stage prevalence of both P . falciparum and P . vivax . Notably the reduction in the P . vivax hypnozoite rate is slow as the hypnozoite reservoir is not directly targeted . The hypnozoite reservoir can be directly targeted using a drug such as primaquine that can eliminate hypnozoites from the liver ( Wells et al . , 2010 ) . The inclusion of primaquine in first-line treatment regimens is predicted to cause substantial reductions in both the P . vivax parasite rate and hypnozoite rate ( Figure 5C ) , as individuals being treated for blood-stage P . vivax infections will also have their hypnozoites removed . A consequence of this strategy is that the hypnozoite reservoir can be targeted efficiently , as individuals with the most hypnozoites are most likely to relapse and potentially be detected by health systems . Figure 6 shows how the inclusion of primaquine in first-line treatment regimens preferentially targets the most intense infections , with the greatest reductions observed in individuals with the most hypnozoites . 10 . 7554/eLife . 04692 . 012Figure 6 .

Individuals with large numbers of hypnozoites are more likely to experience new blood-stage infections and hence become targeted for treatment and have their hypnozoites removed . This results in a selective targeting of the most intensely infected individuals . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 04692 . 012 \n Relapse infections arising from the activation of hypnozoites in the human liver have important consequences for the transmission dynamics of P . vivax . Hypnozoites in the liver constitute a third malaria parasite reservoir , in addition to the reservoirs in the blood circulation and mosquito also present for P . falciparum . Relapses can be incorporated into Ross-Macdonald models of malaria transmission through the addition of a state to represent the hypnozoite reservoir ( Roy et al . , 2013 ) , or as demonstrated here , through consideration of the number of hypnozoites in the liver . This allows the intensity of hypnozoite infection to be estimated which is crucial for understanding patterns of relapse infections ( White , 2011 ) and evaluating the effect of interventions such as primaquine treatment that directly target the hypnozoite reservoir . Hypnozoites are assumed to be subjected to two processes: activation at constant rate \u03b1 , and death at constant rate \u00b5 . By considering infection with batches of hypnozoites , these simple processes can explain many of the complex patterns observed in P . vivax relapses ( see Box 1 ) . A key assumption in the proposed model is the constant activation of hypnozoites . This implies that relapses can occur immediately after primary P . vivax infection , in contrast to suggestions that the first relapse does not occur until 2\u20133 weeks later . The best evidence on early relapses comes from treatment efficacy studies where patients treated for P . vivax are followed for recurrent infection for 42 days ( Douglas et al . , 2010 ) . Except in cases with documented chloroquine resistance ( Price et al . , 2014 ) , recurrent infections are rarely observed prior to day 14 , however the inclusion of long-lasting anti-malarials in treatment regimens provides prophylaxis during this period making detection of parasites unlikely . In a recent study of the slowly eliminated drug dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine ( DP ) Tarning et al . ( 2014 ) tested a model where relapses occur in bursts every 3 weeks , but it arguably provided no better fit to the data than a model of constant hypnozoite activation . Testing the hypothesis of constant activation would require follow up of patients treated with rapidly eliminated artemisinin monotherapy , a challenging proposition given the concerns over artemisinin resistant P . falciparum ( Ashley et al . , 2014 ) . Although the model captures the key drivers of the dynamics of P . vivax transmission , it is a simplified representation subject to a number of limiting assumptions . The potential role of triggers of hypnozoite activation such as febrile illness ( Shanks and White , 2013 ) are not accounted for . There is no heterogeneity or seasonality in transmission , and no age structure . Incorporation of the acquisition of natural immunity into the model will be particularly important for settings with high transmission intensity where immunity has a role in regulating blood-stage infections ( Mueller et al . , 2013 ) . It is assumed that all individuals infected with blood-stage parasites are capable of transmitting to mosquitoes . Similar to the corresponding P . falciparum models , incorporation of these factors would change the quantitative predictions of the model , but not its qualitative behaviour . P . falciparum and P . vivax parasite prevalence ( PfPR and PvPR ) are the most widely reported and best validated metrics of malaria transmission from epidemiological studies ( Gething et al . , 2011a; Gething et al . , 2012 ) providing measurements of the proportion of individuals with detectable blood-stage parasites . In settings with similar levels of P . vivax and P . falciparum transmission , the model predicts PvPR to be greater than PfPR due to the additional blood-stage infections arising from relapses . However , this does not agree with empirical observations which find PfPR to be similar to or greater than PvPR ( Snounou and White , 2004; Mueller et al . , 2009b ) . This is most likely explained by the rapid acquisition of immunity to P . vivax ( Koepfli et al . , 2013; Mueller et al . , 2013 ) the low detectability of P . vivax blood-stage infections ( Harris et al . , 2010 ) , and the longer durations of P . falciparum blood-stage infection ( Molineaux et al . , 2001 ) not captured in the model . Furthermore , the additional P . vivax parasite reservoir in the liver means that PfPR and PvPR are not directly comparable metrics . Thus if a parasitological survey indicates similar parasite prevalence , a greater control effort will be required to reduce P . vivax transmission than to reduce P . falciparum transmission because of the additional infections emerging from the hypnozoite reservoir . The model described here allows the proportion of individuals harbouring hypnozoites to be estimated given metrics such as PvPR . The number of hypnozoites per person is predicted to be over-dispersed with some individuals with intensely infected livers and most carrying few or no hypnozoites ( Figure 4C ) . Estimates of the prevalence and intensity of hypnozoite infection will be dependent on both the uncertainty in the measurable data and the model assumptions . Vector control with ITNs or IRS , and treatment with effective anti-malarial drugs are the cornerstones of malaria control efforts targeting the parasite in the vector and the human host , however they are predicted to have different effects on P . vivax and P . falciparum transmission . Vector control interventions that increase mosquito mortality are expected to cause greater reductions in PfPR than PvPR ( Figure 5A ) , as higher levels of P . vivax transmission can be maintained with fewer mosquito bites . This has been observed in both Thailand ( Sattabongkot et al . , 2004 ) and Brazil ( Coura et al . , 2006 ) where increased vector control has caused greater reductions in P . falciparum than P . vivax . First-line treatment of new blood-stage infections with anti-malarial drugs such as chloroquine or ACTs is predicted to cause moderate reductions in blood-stage prevalence of both P . falciparum and P . vivax ( Figure 5B ) . The addition of primaquine to first-line treatment regimens is expected to cause large reductions in P . vivax blood-stage prevalence , as individuals with the most intense hypnozoite infections are more likely to relapse and be targeted for treatment and hence have their hypnozoites eliminated . The potential to simultaneously target parasite reservoirs in the blood and liver may turn the cause of P . vivax parasites' robust transmission into its Achilles' heel . In P . vivax and P . falciparum co-endemic regions , heterogeneity in exposure to mosquito bites may cause associations between P . falciparum fevers and the risk of future P . vivax relapses ( Douglas et al . , 2011 ) . Thus the inclusion of primaquine in first-line treatment for P . falciparum may also reduce P . vivax transmission . In addition to inclusion in first-line treatment regimens , primaquine can also be administered as part of mass drug administration ( MDA ) programmes . In treatment-reinfection studies of Papua New Guinean children ( Betuela et al . , 2012; Robinson et al . , unpublished ) , mass administration of drugs such as chloroquine or artemether-lumefantrine successfully cleared P . vivax blood-stage infections but rapid recurrence of infection was observed during follow-up\u2014most likely due to relapses . The addition of primaquine to the treatment regimen caused large reductions in the rate of recurrent infections . Although primaquine treatment clears the hypnozoite reservoir , it requires a difficult 14 day treatment regimen , and is not without risk due to vulnerability to haemolytic toxicity among glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase ( G6PD ) deficient patients ( Howes et al . , 2013 ) . Individuals should thus be tested for G6PD deficiency ( Kim et al . , 2011 ) before the administration of primaquine . A primaquine analogue , tafenoquine , is currently undergoing phase three trials and is likely to be licensed for use by 2017 ( Llanos-Cuentas et al . , 2014 ) . Tafenoquine requires a single dose alongside a 3 day chloroquine regimen , but is subject to the same risks in G6PD deficient patients . A quantitative model of P . vivax transmission will allow for the benefits of primaquine treatment to be weighed against the risks of G6PD deficiency and the costs of G6PD testing . Mathematical models of malaria transmission that account for P . vivax relapses can provide valuable insights into the impact of malaria control interventions on the parasite's reservoirs in the vector , the blood and the liver . In the absence of effective diagnostics for detecting liver-stage parasites ( malERA Consultative Group on Diagnoses and Diagnostics , 2011 ) , models will play a crucial role in estimating and predicting the effectiveness of interventions that target the hypnozoite reservoir , either indirectly via vector control and blood-stage anti-malarials or directly via primaquine treatment . \n Following infection with a tropical strain of P . vivax , the population dynamics of hypnozoites in the liver can be described by a within-host model where each hypnozoite is subject to two processes: ( i ) activation leading to relapse infection; and ( ii ) death , either of the hypnozoite itself or the host hepatocyte ( Malato et al . , 2011 ) . Constant activation ( \u03b1 ) and death ( \u00b5 ) rates are assumed implying hypnozoite residence time in the liver is exponentially distributed . The long latency of temperate strains before first relapse can be accounted for by assuming a period of dormancy during which hypnozoites must wait before they can activate . A schematic representation of the within-host model is presented in Figure 7 . 10 . 7554/eLife . 04692 . 014Figure 7 . Within-host model schematic of relapsing hypnozoites in the liver . Hypnozoites from tropical strains of P . vivax will progress to the relapsing phase where they are subject to two processes: death and activation leading to relapse .

During this time they may also move to the right along the flow diagram as the number of hypnozoites reduces due to death . After passing through the M compartments for the long-latency phase , infections will enter the relapsing phase where relapse can occur . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 04692 . 015 The tropical relapse model is assumed to begin with an initial population of N hypnozoites , each of which can either activate at rate \u03b1 , or die at rate \u00b5 , independently of each other . The number of hypnozoites in the liver will decay exponentially with an expected Ne\u2212 ( \u00b5+\u03b1 ) t hypnozoites at time t . Let HiN ( t ) denote the probability that i of N hypnozoites remain in the liver after time t . The hypnozoite population dynamics can be described by the following set of equations: ( 1 ) dHNNdt=\u2212 ( \u03bc+\u03b1 ) NHNNdHiNdt=\u2212 ( \u03bc+\u03b1 ) iHiN+ ( \u03bc+\u03b1 ) ( i+1 ) Hi+1N , i=0\u2026N\u22121 Equation 1 can be solved analytically to give: ( 2 ) HiN ( t ) = ( Ni ) e\u2212N ( \u03bc+\u03b1 ) t ( e ( \u03bc+\u03b1 ) t\u22121 ) N\u2212i Define PjN ( t ) to be the probability that j relapses have occurred by time t . This can be calculated as follows: if i hypnozoites remain in the liver , then N \u2212 i have either activated or died . The probability of each hypnozoite activating is \u03b1\u03bc+\u03b1 . The probability that j of N \u2212 i hypnozoites have activated can thus be calculated from a binomial distribution . Summing over the allowable number of hypnozoites ( at least j hypnozoites must have activated or died for j relapses to be observed ) gives: ( 3 ) PjN ( t ) =\u2211i=0N\u2212j ( N\u2212ij ) ( \u03b1\u03bc+\u03b1 ) j ( \u03bc\u03bc+\u03b1 ) N\u2212i\u2212jHiN ( t ) = ( Nj ) \u03b1j\u03bcN\u2212j ( \u03bc+\u03b1 ) N ( 1\u2212e\u2212 ( \u03bc+\u03b1 ) t ) N ( 1+\u03bc+\u03b1\u03bc1e ( \u03bc+\u03b1 ) t\u22121 ) N\u2212j Equations 1\u20133 describe the population dynamics of hypnozoites in a single individual with N hypnozoites in the absence of exposure to new infections . In a population of individuals , we would expect substantial variation in the numbers of hypnozoites due to heterogeneity in exposure and the variation in sporozoite inoculum from each infectious mosquito bite ( Beier et al . , 1991; Medica and Sinnis , 2005; White et al . , 2013 ) . Based on evidence that the number of sporozoites injected with a mosquito bite approximately follows a geometric distribution ( Beier et al . , 1991 ) , we assume that the number of hypnozoites following a primary infection is also geometrically distributed . If the mean number of hypnozoites is N , then the probability of k hypnozoites is ( NN+1 ) k1N+1 . Assuming a geometrically distributed number of hypnozoites , the three quantities describing the epidemiology of relapses can be estimated in terms of the within-host parameters .

Underlying assumptions of this model are: ( i ) each hypnozoite acts independently of other hypnozoites , for example , hypnozoites will not activate in batches due to mechanisms such as quorum sensing; and , ( ii ) hypnozoite death occurs at a constant rate , due to either death of the hypnozoite within the hepatocyte or death of the hepatocyte itself ( Malato et al . , 2011 ) . The activation of a hypnozoite may not directly correspond to a detected relapse . For example , an infection arising from two hypnozoites activating within a day of each other is likely to be classified as a single relapse . The within-host model can be extended to account for temperate strains of P . vivax . We assume that before a hypnozoite is capable of activating , it must undergo a long-latency phase of duration d . During this period hypnozoites are subject to death at rate \u00b5 . In particular , we assume that the time spent in the temperate long-latency phase can be described by a gamma distribution with mean d and variance d2/M . This gamma distribution can be simulated by M successive compartments with exponential waiting times 1/\u03b4 = d/M . Increasing the number of compartments M reduces the variance in the duration of the dormancy period ( Wearing et al . , 2005 ) . Following a primary infection where N hypnozoites of a temperate phenotype develop in the liver , we define Li , jN as the probability that i of N hypnozoites are waiting in long-latency compartment number j , then the number of dormant and potentially active hypnozoites can be described by the following system of differential equations .

Equation 7 cannot be solved analytically and must be computed numerically to calculate HiN ( t ) and Li , jN ( t ) . A greater deal of uncertainty surrounds the biological processes accounting for the initial long-latency phase observed in temperate strains of P . vivax . In the model implemented here , it is assumed that all hypnozoites in an infection must undergo some waiting period before any of them can activate , and that during the long-latency phase hypnozoites are at risk of death due to natural hepatocyte death . We next embedded the within-host model for tropical relapses in a model for the transmission of P . vivax between humans and mosquitoes ( Figure 8 ) . The transmission dynamics are driven by two processes: ( i ) transmission of parasites through mosquito bites; and ( ii ) relapsing of liver-stage hypnozoites to cause new blood-stage infections . As per the standard Ross-Macdonald theory , the force of blood-stage infections in humans can be calculated as the product of the number of mosquitoes per human m , the rate at which each mosquito bites a human host a , the probability of transmission from mosquito to human following an infectious bite b , and the proportion of mosquitoes that are infectious IM , to give \u03bb = mabIM . Parameter values are provided in Table 1 . The force of infection on mosquitoes can be calculated in a similar manner . We assume that people can be susceptible ( Si ) or infected with blood-stage parasites ( Ii ) , where i denotes the number of hypnozoites in the liver . 10 . 7554/eLife . 04692 . 016Figure 8 .

In the absence of super-infection , the recovery from blood-stage infection is \u03c1i=r .

The within-host model for tropical relapses was fitted in a Bayesian framework to data on time to first relapse infection from three ecological zones with tropical strains of P . vivax: South America , South East Asia and Melanesia ( see Source data 1 ) . The data are described in detail by Battle et al . ( 2014 ) . Individual-level data on time to first recurrence was collated from individuals exposed to P . vivax infection ( either via natural exposure or artificial challenge ) and mostly followed up in the absence of exposure to new infections ( Battle et al . , 2014 ) . The likelihood of the tropical relapse model can be evaluated by applying the model to the data on time to first relapse infection . The first detected relapse will occur after clearance of parasites from the primary infection and after the period of prophylactic protection from anti-malarial drugs . Define QN ( t ) to be the probability that at least 1 of N hypnozoites has relapsed by time t . ( 9 ) QN ( t ) =1\u2212P0N ( t ) =1\u2212 ( \u03bc+\u03b1e\u2212 ( \u03bc+\u03b1 ) t\u03bc+\u03b1 ) N Accounting for a geometrically distributed number of hypnozoites gives: ( 10 ) QG ( N ) ( t ) =\u2211k=0\u221e1N+1 ( NN+1 ) kQk ( t ) where G ( N ) denotes a geometric distribution . An individual j followed up after a primary P . vivax infection will either relapse ( Ij = 1 ) or avoid infection ( Ij = 0 ) . Denote \u03c4j to be the time of detection of infection , or if uninfected , the time until the end of follow up . The likelihood of the parameters \u03b8 = {N , \u03b1 , \u00b5} given the data Dj = {Ij , \u03c4j} is: ( 11 ) L ( \u03b8|Dj ) = ( dQG ( N ) dt|t=\u03c4j ) Ij ( 1\u2212QG ( N ) ( \u03c4j ) ) 1\u2212Ij The log-likelihood ( LL ) for all j individuals is: ( 12 ) LL=\u2211j ( Ijlog ( dQG ( N ) dt|t=\u03c4j ) + ( 1\u2212Ij ) log ( 1\u2212QG ( N ) ( \u03c4j ) ) ) Data on time to first relapse were not sufficiently informative to estimate the three parameters simultaneously and hence prior distributions were assumed . N was assumed to have an informative gamma prior distribution with median 10 ( 95% credible interval ( CrI ) : 1 , 28 ) ( Beier et al . , 1991 ) . \u00b5 was assumed to have an informative gamma prior distribution with median 1/200 ( 95% CrI: 1/309 , 1/140 ) day\u22121 ( Malato et al . , 2011 ) . \u03b1 was assumed to have an uninformative uniform prior distribution U ( 0 , 1 ) .

{"lay_summary": "The Amazon rainforest in South America is the largest tropical forest in the world . Along with being home to a huge variety of plants and wildlife , rainforests also play an important role in storing an element called carbon , which is a core component of all life on Earth . Certain forms of carbon , such as the gas carbon dioxide , contribute to climate change so researchers want to understand what factors affect how much carbon is stored in rainforests . Trees and other plants absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and then incorporate the carbon into carbohydrates and other biological molecules . The Amazon rainforest alone holds around 30% of the total carbon stored in land-based ecosystems . Humans selectively harvest certain species of tree that produce wood with commercial value from the Amazon rainforest . This \u201cselective logging\u201d results in the loss of stored carbon from the rainforest , but the loss can be compensated for in the medium to long term if the forest is left to regrow . New trees and trees that survived the logging grow to fill the gaps left by the felled trees . However , it is not clear how differences in the forest ( for example , forest maturity ) , environmental factors ( such as climate or soil ) and the degree of the disturbance caused by the logging affect the ability of the forest ecosystem to recover the lost carbon . Piponiot et al . used computer modeling to analyze data from over a hundred different forest plots across the Amazon rainforest . The models show that the forest\u2019s ability to recover carbon after selective logging greatly differs between regions . For example , the overall amount of carbon recovered in the first ten years is predicted to be higher in a region in the north known as the Guiana Shield than in the south of the Amazonian basin where the climate is less favorable . The findings of Piponiot et al . highlight the key role the trees that survive selective logging play in carbon recovery . The next step would be to couple this model to historical maps of logging to estimate how the areas of the rainforest that are managed by selective logging shape the overall carbon balance of the Amazon rainforest .", "article": "When 2 Mha of Amazonian forests are disturbed by selective logging each year , more than 90 Tg of carbon ( C ) is emitted to the atmosphere . Emissions are then counterbalanced by forest regrowth . With an original modelling approach , calibrated on a network of 133 permanent forest plots ( 175 ha total ) across Amazonia , we link regional differences in climate , soil and initial biomass with survivors\u2019 and recruits\u2019 C fluxes to provide Amazon-wide predictions of post-logging C recovery . We show that net aboveground C recovery over 10 years is higher in the Guiana Shield and in the west ( 21 \u00b13 Mg C ha-1 ) than in the south ( 12 \u00b13 Mg C ha-1 ) where environmental stress is high ( low rainfall , high seasonality ) . We highlight the key role of survivors in the forest regrowth and elaborate a comprehensive map of post-disturbance C recovery potential in Amazonia . \n With on-going climate change , attention is increasingly drawn to the impacts of human activities on carbon ( C ) cycles ( Griggs and Noguer , 2002 ) , and in particular to the 2 . 1 \u00b1 1 . 1 Pg C yr-1 of C loss caused by various forms and intensities of anthropogenic disturbances in tropical forests ( Grace et al . , 2014 ) . Among those disturbances , selective logging , i . e . the selective harvest of a few merchantable tree species , is particularly widespread: in the Brazilian Amazon alone , about 2 Mha yr\u22121 were logged in 1999\u20132002 ( Asner et al . , 2005 ) . The extent of selective logging in the Brasilian Amazon was equivalent to annual deforestation in the same period , and resulted in C emissions of 90 Tg C yr-1 ( Huang and Asner , 2010 ) which increased anthropogenic C emissions by almost 25% over deforestation alone ( Asner et al . , 2005 ) . In contrast to deforested areas that are used for agriculture and grazing , most selectively logged forests remain as forested areas ( Asner et al . , 2006 ) and may recover C stocks ( West et al . , 2014 ) . Previously logged Amazonian forests may thus accumulate large amounts of C ( Pan et al . , 2011 ) , but this C uptake is difficult to accurately estimate , because while detecting selective logging from space is increasingly feasible ( Frolking et al . , 2009 ) ( even if very few of the IPCC models effectively account for logging ) , directly quantifying forest recovery remains challenging ( Asner et al . , 2009; Houghton et al . , 2012; Goetz et al . , 2015 ) . Studies based on field measurements ( e . g . Sist and Ferreira , 2007; Blanc et al . , 2009; West et al . , 2014; Vidal et al . , 2016 ) , sometimes coupled with modeling approaches ( e . g . Gourlet-Fleury et al . , 2005; Valle et al . , 2007 ) or airborne light detection and ranging ( LiDAR ) measurements ( e . g . Andersen et al . , 2014 ) have assessed post-logging dynamics at particular sites . Nonetheless , to our knowledge no spatially-explicit investigation of post-logging C dynamics at the Amazon biome scale is available . C losses from selective logging are determined by harvest intensity ( i . e . number of trees felled or volume of wood extracted ) plus the care with which harvest operations are conducted , which affects the amount of collateral damage . After logging , C losses continue for several years due to elevated mortality rates of trees injured during harvesting operations ( Shenkin et al . , 2015 ) . Logged forests may recover their aboveground carbon stocks ( ACS ) via enhanced growth of survivors and recruited trees ( Blanc et al . , 2009 ) . Full recovery of pre-disturbance ACS in logged stands reportedly requires up to 125 years , depending primarily on disturbance intensity ( Rutishauser et al . , 2015 ) . The underlying recovery processes ( i . e . tree mortality , growth and recruitment ) are likely to vary with the clear geographical patterns in forest structure and dynamics across the Amazon Basin and Guiana Shield . In particular , northeast-southwest gradients have been reported for ACS ( Malhi and Wright , 2004 ) , net primary productivity ( Arag\u00e3o et al . , 2009 ) , wood density ( Baker et al . , 2004 ) , and floristic composition ( ter Steege et al . , 2006 ) . Such gradients coincide with climate and edaphic conditions that range from nearly a\u00a0seasonal nutrient-limited in the northeast to seasonally dry and nutrient-rich in the southwest ( Quesada et al . , 2012 ) . These regional differences in biotic and abiotic conditions largely constrain demographic processes that ultimately shape forest C balances . Here we partition the contributions to post-disturbance ACS gain ( from growth and recruitment of trees \u226520 cm DBH ) and ACS loss ( from mortality ) of survivors and recruited trees to detect the main drivers and patterns of ACS recovery in forests disturbed by selective logging across Amazonia sensu lato ( that includes the Amazon Basin and the Guiana Shield ) . Based on long-term ( 8\u201330 year ) inventory data from 13 experimentally-disturbed sites ( Sist et al . , 2015 ) across Amazonia ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1 ) , 133 permanent forest plots ( 175 ha in total ) that cover a large gradient of disturbance intensities ( ACS losses ranging from 1% to 71% ) were used to model the trajectory of those post-disturbance ACS changes ( Figure 1 ) in a comprehensive Bayesian framework . We quantify the effect of pre-disturbance ecosystem characteristics [the site\u2019s average pre-logging ACS ( a\u2062c\u2062s\u20620 ) and the relative difference between each plot and a\u2062c\u2062s\u20620 as a proxy of forest maturity ( d\u2062a\u2062c\u2062s ) ] , disturbance intensity [percentage of pre-logging ACS lost ( l\u2062o\u2062s\u2062s ) ] , and interactions with the environment [annual precipitation ( p\u2062r\u2062e\u2062c ) , seasonality of precipitation ( s\u2062e\u2062a\u2062s ) , and soil bulk density ( b\u2062d ) ] ( Figure 2 ) on the rates at which post-disturbance ACS changes converge to a theoretical steady state ( as in Figure 1 , see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods for more details ) . With global maps of ACS ( Avitabile et al . , 2016 ) , climatic conditions ( Hijmans et al . , 2005 ) and soil bulk density ( Nachtergaele et al . , 2008 ) , we up-scale our results to Amazonia ( sensu lato ) and elaborate predictive maps of potential ACS changes over 10 years under the hypothesis of a 40% ACS loss , which is a common disturbance intensity after conventional logging in Amazonia ( Blanc et al . , 2009; Martin et al . , 2015; West et al . , 2014 ) . Summing these ACS changes over time gives the net post-disturbance rate of ACS accumulation . Disentangling ACS recovery into demographic processes and cohorts is essential to reveal mechanisms underlying ACS responses to disturbance and to make more robust predictions of ACS recovery compared to an all-in-one approach ( see Appendix ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 21394 . 003Figure 1 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 21394 . 007 \n At a given site , variations of post-logging ACS changes are explained with the disturbance intensity ( l\u2062o\u2062s\u2062s ) and the relative forest maturity ( d\u2062a\u2062c\u2062s ) . At high disturbance intensity ( positive l\u2062o\u2062s\u2062s ) as well as in relatively immature forests ( negative d\u2062a\u2062c\u2062s ) , ACS gain from recruits is high: recruitment decreases slowly ( Figure 2b and Figure 3b ) and recruits\u2019 growth increases rapidly ( Figure 2c and Figure 3c ) . In the same conditions of high disturbance intensity , survivors\u2019 ACS growth is lower in the first years following logging than for low disturbance intensities , but declines slowly ( Figure 2a and Figure 3a ) . Disturbance intensity and relative forest maturity have a weak effect on ACS loss from both survivors and recruits ( Figures 2d , e and 3d , e ) . Overall , net ACS change stays high longer at high disturbance intensity ( Figure 3f ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 21394 . 008Figure 3 .

ACS changes were calculated with all parameters set to their maximum-likelihood value and covariates ( except standardized disturbance intensity l\u2062o\u2062s\u2062s ) set to 0 . Time since minimum ACS varies from 0 to 30 year ( i . e . the calibration interval ) and disturbance intensity ranges between 5% and 60% of initial ACS loss . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 21394 . 008 Variations of post-logging ACS changes between sites are explained with the mean ACS of each site ( a\u2062c\u2062s\u20620 ) , climatic conditions [annual precipitation ( p\u2062r\u2062e\u2062c ) , seasonality of precipitation ( s\u2062e\u2062a\u2062s ) ] and the soil bulk density ( b\u2062d ) . Contribution of survivors\u2019 growth to ACS recovery declined slowly in sites with low a\u2062c\u2062s\u20620 and high water stress ( low precipitation , high seasonality and high bulk density ) ( Figure 2a ) . Survivors\u2019 ACS loss showed the opposite pattern ( Figure 2d ) except in apparent response to high seasonality of precipitation ( s\u2062e\u2062a\u2062s ) that slowed the post-disturbance rates of decline of both ACS growth and loss . Despite slower recruits\u2019 ACS growth in sites with high pre-logging ACS ( a\u2062c\u2062s\u20620 ) , no other regional covariate had significant effects on recruits\u2019 ACS changes ( Figure 2b , c and e ) . While no significant environmental effects were detected for recruits\u2019 ACS changes ( Figures 2 and 4 ) , the\u00a0survivors showed a highly structured regional gradient: ( i ) ACS gain from survivors\u2019 ACS growth is high in the west and in the Guiana Shield , but low in the south ( Figure 4a ) , whereas ( ii ) survivors\u2019 ACS loss is low in the south and in the Guiana Shield but high in the west ( Figure 4d ) . To illustrate how these regional differences will be critical for future ACS across Amazonia , we developed a map of net ACS recovery over the first 10 years after a 40% ACS loss by integrating the sum of ACS change predictions through time ( Figure 5 ) . Across the region , net ACS recovery over the first ten years after a 40% ACS loss is predicted to be 17 \u00b1\u00a07 Mg C ha-1 , with higher values in the west and in the Guiana Shield ( Figure 5a ) . The uncertainty in predictions was low to medium ( coefficient of variation under 40% ) in 82% of the mapped area , and high ( coefficient of variation above 50% ) in 5% of the mapped area ( Figure 5b ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 21394 . 009Figure 4 .

Four areas were arbitrarily chosen to illustrate four different geographical behaviours: ( 1 ) the Guiana Shield and ( 2 ) northwestern Amazonia are two areas with high ACS recovery; the Guiana Shield has higher initial ACS and slower ACS dynamics whereas northwestern Amazonia has lower initial ACS and faster ACS dynamics . ( 3 ) central Amazonia has intermediate ACS recovery . ( 4 ) southern Amazonia has low ACS recovery . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 21394 . 010 Four areas ( Figure 5a ) were selected to represent four contrasted cases of net ACS recovery in time ( Figure 6 ) : two areas , northwestern Amazonia and the Guiana Shield , with high ACS accumulation ( 21 \u00b1\u00a03 Mg C ha-1 over 10 year ) , one intermediate area , central Amazonia ( 15 \u00b1\u00a01 Mg C ha-1 over 10 year ) and one area with low ACS accumulation , southern Amazonia ( 12 \u00b1\u00a03 Mg C ha-1 over 10 year ) . Survivors\u2019 contribution to the sum of ACS gains ( recruitment and growth ) over the first 10 years after disturbance was 71 \u00b1\u00a04% in the Guiana Shield , 71 \u00b1\u00a02% in the west; 63 \u00b1\u00a04% in central Amazonia and 55 \u00b1\u00a06% in the south . Predicted net ACS recovery ( Figure 5 ) and survivors\u2019 ACS growth ( Figure 4a ) are highly correlated: \u03c1=0 . 90 ( Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 21394 . 011Figure 6 . Predicted contribution of annual ACS changes in ACS recovery in four regions of Amazonia ( Figure 5 ) . The white line is the net annual ACS recovery , i . e . the sum of all annual ACS changes . Survivors\u2019 ( green ) and recruits\u2019 ( orange ) contribution are positive for ACS gains ( survivors\u2019 ACS growth , new recruits\u2019 ACS and recruits\u2019 ACS growth ) and negative for survivors\u2019 and recruits\u2019 ACS loss . Areas with higher levels of transparency and dotted lines are out of the calibration period ( 0\u201330 year ) . In the Guiana Shield and in nothwestern Amazonia , high levels of net ACS recovery are explained by large ACS gain from survivors\u2019 growth . Extrapolation was based on global rasters: topsoil bulk density from the Harmonized global soil database ( Nachtergaele et al . , 2008 ) , precipitation data from Worldclim ( Hijmans et al . , 2005 ) and biomass stocks from Avitabile et al . ( Avitabile et al . , 2016 ) map . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 21394 . 011 \n Contrasting post-disturbance ACS dynamics were detected among the western Amazon , Guiana Shield , and southern Amazon ( Figure 4 ) . ( i ) In the western Amazon , environmental stress is reduced due to fertile soils and abundant , mostly non-seasonal precipitation , but forests are prone to frequent and sometimes large-scale wind-induced disturbances ( Esp\u00edrito-Santo et al . , 2014 ) . Such conditions of low stress and high disturbance tend to favor fast-growing species with rapid life cycles ( He et al . , 2013 ) , which results in fast ACS gain and loss from survivors even after the logging disturbance ( Figures 4a , d and 6 ) . ( ii ) Forests of the Guiana Shield are generally dense and grow on nutrient-poor soils ( Quesada et al . , 2012 ) , where wood productivity is highly constrained by competition for key nutrients , especially phosphorus and nitrogen ( Santiago , 2015; Mercado et al . , 2011 ) . The short duration pulse of nutrients released from readily decomposed stems , twigs and leaves of trees damaged and killed by logging may thus explain the substantial but limited-duration increase in growth of survivors on these nutrient-poor soils ( Figure 6 ) . Yet post-disturbance ACS loss from survivors\u2019 mortality decreases slowly in the Guiana Shield ( Figure 6 ) . This is consistent with the low mortality rates and the high tree longevity reported in old-growth forests of this region ( Phillips et al . , 2004 ) . ( iii ) In the southern Amazon , high seasonal water stress is the main constraint on ACS recovery ( Wagner et al . , 2016 ) . Stress-tolerant trees are generally poor competitors ( He et al . , 2013 ) and this may explain the slow ACS changes of survivors in this region ( Figures 4a , d and 6 ) . Finally , Central Amazonia is a transition zone for the main environmental and biotic gradients found in Amazonia: ( 1 ) a competition gradient between dense and nutrient-poor northeastern forests and nutrient-rich western forests; ( 2 ) an environmental gradient between northern wet forests and southern drier forests ( Quesada et al . , 2012 ) . Across Amazonia , survivors contribute most to post-disturbance ACS recovery . In regions where survivors\u2019 ACS gain is high ( west and northeast ) , net ACS recovery is also high: annual ACS recovery is between 1 and 3 Mg C ha-1 yr-1 in the first 10 year after logging ( Figure 6 ) , lower than in Amazonian secondary forests ( 3\u20135 Mg C ha-1 yr\u22121 in the first 20 year after abandonment of land use [Poorter et al . , 2016] ) . Recruits , for their part , have very low geographical variations in post-logging ACS changes: 10 years after the disturbance they are predicted to store similar amounts of ACS almost everywhere in Amazonia . Nevertheless , small trees with DBH <20 cm have not been accounted for in our study and may play an important role in post-logging ACS changes . The 10\u201320 cm DBH size class contains as much as 14% of total ACS and may be highly dynamic in some Amazonian forests ( Vieira et al . , 2004 ) . Because of the slow tree growth rates in Amazonia ( Vieira et al . , 2005; Herault et al . , 2010 ) , many trees will not reach the 20 cm DBH threshold 10 years after logging: the effects of the 10\u201320 cm DBH stratum on post-logging ACS changes are likely to be missed in sites with less than 10 years of measurements ( e . g . Peteco , Ecosilva , Iracema , Cumaru ) and should be studied , together with the natural regeneration , in the future . At the stand level , high disturbance intensities reduce survivors\u2019 ACS: survivors\u2019 ACS growth is consequently lower ( Figure 3a ) , resulting in lower net ACS change during the first 10 years of the recovery period ( Figure 3f ) . High disturbance intensities as well as relatively low forest maturity alleviate competition , and this is probably why ACS contributions from recruits remain high for longer ( Figure 2b ) in such enhanced growth conditions ( Herault et al . , 2010 ) . In the first years after logging , net ACS recovery depends little on disturbance intensity ( Figure 3f ) , but recovery is predicted to last longer in heavily logged forests . In immature forests , intense self-thinning ( Swaine et al . , 1987 ) may explain fast ACS losses from survivors\u2019 mortality ( Figure 2d ) . In the tropics , reduced-impact logging techniques ( RIL; [Putz et al . , 2008] ) are promoted to reduce collateral damage to residual stands and biodiversity . Our results reveal that lower disturbance intensities , as a direct consequence of the\u00a0employment of RIL techniques , could increase survivors\u2019 ACS growth and slow down their ACS loss . Given that government specified minimum cutting cycles are short , e . g . 35 year in the Brazilian Amazon ( Blaser et al . , 2011 ) , and that many commercial species are slow-growing and dense-wooded ( Dauber et al . , 2005; Wright et al . , 2010 ) , available timber stocks for the next cutting cycle will be comprised mostly of survivors . Attention should be taken to high harvest intensities and/or substantial incidental damage due to poor harvesting practices that diminish stocks of survivors , even if they promote recruitment . Most trees that recruit are fast-growing pioneers that are favored by disturbance but are vulnerable to water stress ( Bonal et al . , 2016 ) and competition ( Valladares and Niinemets , 2008 ) , and because their height is lower than in mature forests ( Rutishauser et al . , 2016 ) , they might have reduced carbon sequestration potential . With ongoing climate change and increased frequencies and intensities of droughts in Amazonia ( Malhi et al . , 2008 ) , betting on recruits to store C in forests disturbed by selective logging might thus be a risky gamble . In this study , we focus on one type of disturbance: selective logging . Because of its economic value and implications for forest management , selective logging is a long-studied human disturbance in tropical forests , and the data gathered by the TmFO network are unique in terms of experiment duration and spatial extent . We nevertheless believe that our study gives clues on the regional differences in Amazonian forests response to large ACS losses induced by other disturbances ( e . g . droughts , fire ) that are expected to increase in frequency with ongoing global changes ( Bonal et al . , 2016 ) . \n Our study includes data from thirteen long-term ( 8\u201330 year ) experimental forest sites located in the Amazon Basin and the Guiana Shield ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . Sites meet the following criteria: ( i ) located in tropical forests with mean annual precipitation above 1000 mm; ( ii ) a total censused area above 1 ha; ( iii ) at least one pre-logging census and ( iv ) at least two post-logging censuses . For each site , we extracted annual precipitation and seasonality of precipitation data from WorldClim ( RRID:SCR_010244 ) ( Hijmans et al . , 2005 ) , topsoil bulk density data from the Harmonized World Soil database ( Nachtergaele et al . , 2008 ) , and the synthetic climatic index from Chave et al . ( Chave et al . , 2014 ) , using in all cases the highest resolution data available ( 30 arc-seconds ) . For one of our sites ( La Chonta , see Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1 ) , field measurements of precipitation ( mean\u00a0=\u00a01580 mm yr-1 ) differed substantially from WorldClim data ( 1032 mm yr-1 ) : in this particular case we used the measured value and adjusted the synthetic climatic index ( E ) in the allometric equation ( Chave et al . , 2014 ) accordingly . Sites' data is available at Dryad Digital Repository ( Piponiot et al . , 2016 ) . In all plots , diameter at breast height ( DBH ) of trees >20 cm DBH were measured , and trees were identified to the lowest taxonomic level: to the species level ( 75% ) when possible , or to the genus level ( 15% ) ; 10% of trees were not identified . To get the wood density , we applied the following standardized protocol to all sites: ( i ) trees identified to the species level were assigned the corresponding wood specific gravity value from the Global Wood Density Database ( GWDD , doi:10 . 5061/dryad . 234/1 ) ( Zanne et al . , 2009 ) ; ( ii ) trees identified to the genus level were assigned a genus-average wood density; ( iii ) trees with no botanical identification or that were not in the GWDD were assigned the site-average wood density . The aboveground biomass ( AGB ) was estimated with the allometric equations from Chave et al . ( Chave et al . , 2014 ) . Biomass was assumed to be 50% carbon ( Penman et al . , 2003 ) . The ACS of every tree i was then computed as follows: ( 1 ) ACSi^=exp ( \u22121 . 803\u22120 . 976\u00d7E+0 . 976\u00d7ln ( WDi ) ++2 . 673\u00d7ln ( DBHi ) \u22120 . 0299\u00d7ln ( DBHi2 ) ) \u00d70 . 5 where W\u2062Di and D\u2062B\u2062Hi are the specific wood density and diameter at breast height of the tree i and E is the synthetic climatic index ( Chave et al . , 2014 ) . The ACS changes\u00a0data that was generated is available at Dryad Digital Repository ( Piponiot et al . , 2016 ) . After logging , plot ACS decreases rapidly until it reaches its minimum value ( a\u2062c\u2062s\u2062m\u2062i\u2062n ) a few years later . This transition point determines the beginning tm\u2062i\u2062n=t0 of the recovery period . a\u2062c\u2062s\u2062m\u2062i\u2062n was estimated as the minimum ACS in the 4 years following logging activities . Because our focus is on post-logging ACS recovery , we did not include in our analysis plots where the minimum ACS value was not reached within the 4 years after logging , either because the logging activity did not affect the plot or because there were other sources of disturbance long after logging ( fire , road opening , silvicultural treatments ) . For each plot j and census k , with tk the time since the beginning of the recovery period t0 , we define 5 ACS changes : new recruits\u2019 ACS ( R\u2062rj , k ) is the ACS of all trees <20 cm DBH at tk-1 and \u226520 cm DBH at tk; recruits\u2019 ACS growth ( R\u2062gj , k ) is the ACS increment of living recruits between tk-1 and tk ; recruits\u2019 ACS loss ( R\u2062lj , k ) is the C in recruits that die between tk-1 and tk; survivors\u2019 ACS growth ( S\u2062gj , k ) is the ACS increment of living survivors between tk-1 and tk; survivors\u2019 ACS loss ( S\u2062lj , k ) is the ACS of survivors that die between tk-1 and tk . ACS gains ( S\u2062g , R\u2062r , R\u2062g ) are positive and ACS losses ( S\u2062l , R\u2062l ) are negative . Instantaneous ACS changes are subject to stochastic variation over time: because we are less interested in year-to-year variations than in long-term ACS trajectories , we modelled cumulative ACS changes instead of annual ACS changes . Cumulative ACS changes ( Mg C ha-1 ) were defined as follows: ( 2 ) c\u2062C\u2062h\u2062a\u2062n\u2062g\u2062ej , k=\u2211m=0kC\u2062h\u2062a\u2062n\u2062g\u2062ej , m where j is the plot , tk the time since t0 ( yr ) and C\u2062h\u2062a\u2062n\u2062g\u2062e is the annual ACS change ( Mg C ha-1 yr-1 ) , either recruits\u2019 ACS ( R\u2062r ) , recruits\u2019 ACS growth ( R\u2062g ) , recruits\u2019 ACS loss ( R\u2062l ) , survivors\u2019 ACS growth ( S\u2062g ) , or survivors\u2019 ACS loss ( S\u2062l ) . To model ACS changes , we chose six covariates : ( 1 ) l\u2062o\u2062s\u2062s disturbance intensity , i . e . percentage of initial ACS loss; ( 2 ) a\u2062c\u2062s\u20620 mean ACS of the site; ( 3 ) d\u2062a\u2062c\u2062s relative ACS of the plot , as a % of a\u2062c\u2062s\u20620; ( 4 ) p\u2062r\u2062e\u2062c annual precipitation; ( 5 ) s\u2062e\u2062a\u2062s precipitation seasonality; ( 6 ) b\u2062d topsoil bulk density . To give equivalent weight to all covariates , we centred and standardized them in order to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one over all observations . The uncertainty associated with ACS covariates ( l\u2062o\u2062s\u2062s , a\u2062c\u2062s\u20620 , d\u2062a\u2062c\u2062s ) is less than 10% ( Chave et al . , 2014 ) . Climatic covariates ( annual precipitation p\u2062r\u2062e\u2062c and precipitation seasonality s\u2062e\u2062a\u2062s ) were extracted from Worldclim rasters ( RRID:SCR_010244 ) . Error in Worldclim precipitation data was estimated to be <10 mm in Amazonia ( Hijmans et al . , 2005 ) . There is no information on the uncertainty on topsoil bulk density but we expect it to be higher than the uncertainty on other covariates , due to measurement ( De Vos et al . , 2005 ) and interpolation methods ( Hendriks et al . , 2016 ) . Survivors\u2019 cumulative ACS changes are null at t=0 ( by definition ) . When all survivors are dead , their ACS changes stop: annual ACS changes become null and cumulative ACS changes reach a constant/finite limit . We decided to model survivors\u2019 cumulative ACS growth c\u2062S\u2062g and ACS loss c\u2062S\u2062l as: ( 3 ) c\u2062Si , j , k\u223c\ud835\udca9\u2062 ( \u03b1jS\u00d7 ( 1-e\u2062x\u2062p\u2062 ( -\u03b2jS\u00d7tk ) ) , ( \u03c3ES ) 2 ) where j is the plot , tk is the time since t0 , S is either S\u2062g or Sl . \u03b1jS is the finite limit of the cumulative ACS change and \u03b2jS the rate at which the cumulative ACS change converges to this limit . By choosing an exponential kernel , we assume that survivors\u2019 ACS change at tk is proportional to survivors\u2019 ACS change at tk-1 . Because \u03b1jS values are expected to vary among plots , they are modelled with the following distribution: ( 4 ) \u03b1jS\u223c\ud835\udca9\u2062 ( \u03b10S , ( \u03c3\u03b1S ) 2 ) Parameter \u03b2jS is the rate at which survivors\u2019 ACS change ( from growth or mortality ) on plot j converges to a finite limit after the disturbance: it reflects the response rapidity of survivors\u2019 ACS changes to disturbance . Because we are interested in predicting variations in \u03b2jS ( S is either S\u2062g or S\u2062l ) , we expressed \u03b2jS as a function of covariates: ( 5 ) \u03b2jS=\u03b20S+\u2211l=16 ( \u03bblS\u00d7Vj , l ) where \u2211l=16 ( \u03bblS\u00d7Vj , l ) , is the effect of covariates ( Vj , l ) on the post-logging rate \u03b2j . Covariates are centred and standardized and are ( 1 ) l\u2062o\u2062s\u2062s : disturbance intensity , i . e . percentage of initial ACS loss; ( 2 ) a\u2062c\u2062s\u20620 : mean ACS of the site; ( 3 ) d\u2062a\u2062c\u2062s relative ACS of the plot , as a % of a\u2062c\u2062s\u20620; ( 4 ) p\u2062r\u2062e\u2062c annual precipitation; ( 5 ) s\u2062e\u2062a\u2062s precipitation seasonality; ( 6 ) b\u2062d topsoil bulk density . When all survivors in plot j are dead , all the C gained by their growth ( c\u2062S\u2062gj , \u221e=\u03b1jS\u2062g ) plus their initial ACS ( a\u2062c\u2062s\u2062m\u2062i\u2062nj ) will have been lost ( c\u2062S\u2062lj , \u221e=\u03b1jS\u2062l ) . We thus added the following constraint to each plot j: ( 6 ) \u03b1jS\u2062l+\u03b1jS\u2062g+a\u2062c\u2062s\u2062m\u2062i\u2062nj=0 with \u03b1jS\u2062g , \u03b1jS\u2062l the finite limits of survivors\u2019 cumulative ACS growth and ACS loss respectively , and a\u2062c\u2062s\u2062m\u2062i\u2062nj the ACS of the plot j at tm\u2062i\u2062n=t0 . When survivors are all dead , recruits will constitute the new forest . We made the assumption that the ACS of this new forest will reach a dynamic equilibrium: recruits\u2019 annual ACS changes are expected to converge to constant values ( that are however prone to small inter-annual variations ) , with ACS gains compensating ACS losses . Because there are no recruits yet at t0 , recruits\u2019 annual ACS growth ( R\u2062g ) and ACS loss ( R\u2062l ) are zero , and progressively increase to reach their asymptotic values . Recruits\u2019 annual ACS growth and ACS loss can be thus modelled with the function: ( 7 ) f\u2062 ( t;\u03b1 , \u03b2 ) =\u03b1\u00d7 ( 1-e\u2062x\u2062p\u2062 ( -\u03b2\u00d7t ) ) where t is the time since the beginning of the recovery period . In the same logic as survivors\u2019 cumulative ACS change , \u03b1 is the asymptotic value of recruits\u2019 annual ACS change ( Mg C ha-1 yr-1 ) , and \u03b2 is the rate at which this asymptotic value is reached . Contrary to recruits\u2019 annual ACS growth and ACS loss , the ACS of new recruits ( R\u2062r ) is high at t0 because of the competition drop induced by logging , but then progressively decreases to reach its asymptotic value . We modelled it with the following function: ( 8 ) f\u2062 ( t;\u03b1 , \u03b2 , \u03b7 ) =\u03b1\u00d7 ( 1+\u03b7\u00d7e\u2062x\u2062p\u2062 ( -\u03b2\u00d7t ) ) where t is the time since logging . The parameter \u03b7 was added to allow annual recruited ACS to be higher than \u03b1 at t0 . As stated before , we chose to model cumulative ACS changes instead of annual ACS changes . The general model for recruits\u2019 cumulative ACS changes is deduced by integrating annual ACS changes from t0 to tk: ( 9 ) cRi , j , k\u223c\ud835\udca9 ( \u03b1iR\u00d7 ( tk+\u03b7\u00d71\u2212exp ( \u2212\u03b2jR\u00d7tk ) \u03b2jR ) , ( \u03c3ER ) 2 ) where i is the site , j is the plot , tk is the time since t0 R is either Rr , Rg or R\u2062l . When R is R\u2062g or R\u2062l , \u03b7=-1; when R is R\u2062r , \u03b7>0 . Once the forest reaches a new dynamic equilibrium , recruits\u2019 annual ACS changes should depend mostly on each site\u2019s characteristics: we expect there to be more inter-site than intra-site variation in recruits\u2019 asymptotic ACS changes \u03b1R . This is why we use one value \u03b1iR per site i , and model it as follows: ( 10 ) \u03b1iR\u223c\ud835\udca9\u2062 ( \u03b10R; ( \u03c3\u03b1R ) 2 ) When the dynamic equilibrium is reached , annual ACS gain ( growth and recruitment ) compensates annual ACS loss ( mortality ) . We thus added the following constraint for every site i: ( 11 ) \u03b1iR\u2062r+\u03b1iR\u2062g+\u03b1iR\u2062l=0 With the same logic as for survivors , we are interested in predicting variation in \u03b2R . Given that we use one value \u03b1iR per site i ( i . e . all plots in one site i have the same value for \u03b1iR ) , we chose to take into account the inter-plot variability as follows: ( 12 ) \u03b2jR\u223c\ud835\udca9\u2062 ( \u03b20R+\u2211l=16 ( \u03bblR\u00d7Vj , l ) \u2062 , \u2062 ( \u03c3\u03b2R ) 2 ) Bayesian hierarchical models were inferred through MCMC methods using an adaptive form of the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling ( Carpenter et al . , 2015 ) . Each observation was given a weight proportional to the size of the plot . Codes were developed using the R language ( RRID:SCR_001905 ) ( R Developement Core Team , 2015 ) and the Rstan package ( Carpenter et al . , 2015 ) . A detailed list of priors is provided in Table 1 . 10 . 7554/eLife . 21394 . 012Table 1 . List of priors used to infer ACS changes in a Bayesian framework . Models are : ( S\u2062g ) survivors\u2019 ACS growth , ( S\u2062l ) survivors\u2019 ACS loss , ( R\u2062r ) new recruits\u2019 ACS , ( R\u2062g ) recruits\u2019 ACS growth , ( R\u2062l ) recruits\u2019 ACS loss . \u03bbl\u2062o\u2062s\u2062s is the parameter relative to the covariate l\u2062o\u2062s\u2062s ( logging intensity ) .

{"lay_summary": "Neurons that arise in the adult nervous system originate from neural stem cells and neural progenitor cells . Neural stem cells have long lives , much of which they spend in a quiescent state . Neural stem cells can also give rise to neural progenitor cells , which proliferate rapidly during their short lives and then \u2018differentiate\u2019 into neurons or glia . Unlike some other tissues , it has not been possible to identify or purify neural stem cells directly from the tissue . Consequently , neural stem and progenitor cells have usually been studied retrospectively , based on their ability to form colonies in laboratory cell cultures . A region of the brain called the subventricular zone contains both neural stem cells and neural progenitor cells , and is one of only two regions of the brain where neural stem cells are found in adult mammals . When cells from the subventricular zone are cultured in a way that allows the cells to freely float around ( rather than growing on a surface ) , a few percent form spherical colonies called neurospheres . Since neurosphere-forming cells can self-renew and differentiate into neurons and glia , the ability of cells to form neurospheres has generally been taken as evidence that they are stem cells . However , the exact relationship between neural stem cells and neurosphere-forming cells has been uncertain . Now , Mich , Signer et al . have used a technique called flow cytometry to identify and isolate neural stem cells and neurosphere-forming cells directly from the subventricular zone . The neural stem cells , which Mich , Signer et al . term pre-GEPCOT cells ( based on an acronym of the markers used to isolate the cells ) , were long-lived and quiescent , but they lacked the ability to form colonies in culture . The neurosphere-forming cells , named GEPCOT cells , were short-lived and highly proliferative in the brain . These results demonstrate that the cells that form neurospheres in culture are not stem cells at all , and that real stem cells are not able to form colonies under existing culture conditions . The identification of undifferentiated pre-GEPCOT and GEPCOT cells will make it possible to directly study the properties of these cells inside the mouse brain , and to isolate live cells to test how they function . The results also highlight the need for new tests to study neural stem cell function , given that current tests using neurospheres do not detect stem cells as commonly assumed .", "article": "Neurosphere formation is commonly used as a surrogate for neural stem cell ( NSC ) function but the relationship between neurosphere-initiating cells ( NICs ) and NSCs remains unclear . We prospectively identified , and isolated by flow cytometry , adult mouse lateral ventricle subventricular zone ( SVZ ) NICs as GlastmidEGFRhighPlexinB2highCD24\u2212/lowO4/PSA-NCAM\u2212/lowTer119/CD45\u2212 ( GEPCOT ) cells . They were highly mitotic and short-lived in vivo based on fate-mapping with Ascl1CreERT2 and Dlx1CreERT2 . In contrast , pre-GEPCOT cells were quiescent , expressed higher Glast , and lower EGFR and PlexinB2 . Pre-GEPCOT cells could not form neurospheres but expressed the stem cell markers Slc1a3-CreERT , GFAP-CreERT2 , Sox2CreERT2 , and Gli1CreERT2 and were long-lived in vivo . While GEPCOT NICs were ablated by temozolomide , pre-GEPCOT cells survived and repopulated the SVZ . Conditional deletion of the Bmi-1 polycomb protein depleted pre-GEPCOT and GEPCOT cells , though pre-GEPCOT cells were more dependent upon Bmi-1 for Cdkn2a ( p16Ink4a ) repression . Our data distinguish quiescent NSCs from NICs and make it possible to study their properties in vivo . \n Neural stem cells ( NSCs ) reside in two regions of the adult mammalian forebrain: the subgranular zone in the dentate gyrus and the subventricular zone in the lateral wall of the lateral ventricle ( SVZ ) . SVZ NSCs persist throughout adult life ( Maslov et al . , 2004; Molofsky et al . , 2006; Imayoshi et al . , 2008 ) , giving rise primarily to neurons in the olfactory bulb as well as some astrocytes in the olfactory bulb ( Lois and Alvarez-Buylla , 1994; Lois et al . , 1996; Doetsch et al . , 1999b; Ahn and Joyner , 2005; Kuo et al . , 2006; Lagace et al . , 2007; Merkle et al . , 2007; Imayoshi et al . , 2008; Chen et al . , 2009 ) and oligodendrocytes in the corpus callosum and cortex ( Nait-Oumesmar et al . , 1999; Menn et al . , 2006 ) . In vivo , these NSCs are quiescent ( Doetsch et al . , 1999a; Pastrana et al . , 2009 ) , resistant to anti-mitotic agents ( Morshead et al . , 1994; Doetsch et al . , 1999b , 2002; Giachino and Taylor , 2009 ) , long-lived ( Ahn and Joyner , 2005; Imayoshi et al . , 2008 ) , and capable of regenerating the SVZ after injury ( Doetsch et al . , 1999b , 2002; L\u00f3pez-Ju\u00e1rez et al . , 2013 ) . Clonal colony-forming assays have been widely used to study neural stem/progenitor cells that give rise to neurons , astrocytes , and oligodendrocytes in adherent cultures ( Davis and Temple , 1994 ) and non-adherent neurosphere cultures ( Reynolds and Weiss , 1992 ) . However , in the adult forebrain it remains uncertain whether these colonies are formed by quiescent neural stem cells ( qNSCs ) or by mitotically active and shorter-lived multipotent progenitors ( Morshead et al . , 1994; Doetsch et al . , 2002; Reynolds and Rietze , 2005; Pastrana et al . , 2009 , 2011 ) . Moreover , reliance upon retrospective colony-formation assays makes it impossible to directly study qNSCs or NICs as they exist in vivo . Pioneering work by Alvarez-Buylla and colleagues has demonstrated the existence of a lineage of NSCs and transit amplifying cells in the SVZ that gives rise to neuronal progenitors throughout life ( Lois and Alvarez-Buylla , 1994; Doetsch et al . , 1997 , 1999a; Mirzadeh et al . , 2008; Ihrie and Alvarez-Buylla , 2011 ) . By electron microscopy and immunofluorescence analysis they identified GFAP-expressing type B cells that appear to be the qNSCs . These cells are resistant to anti-mitotic agents such as AraC and appear capable of repopulating the SVZ after AraC treatment ( Doetsch et al . , 1999a , 1999b , 2002 ) . Type B cells are thought to give rise to Ascl1- and Dlx2-expressing type C cells , which are mitotically active and ablated by anti-mitotic agents ( Morshead et al . , 1994; Doetsch et al . , 1999b , 2002; Pastrana et al . , 2009 ) . The type C cells give rise to Dcx- and PSA-NCAM-expressing type A neuronal progenitors . These studies have provided a critical framework for understanding the SVZ neurogenic lineage , though the inability to purify live cells from each stage of this hierarchy has hampered efforts to assess their properties . The inability to prospectively identify and isolate uncultured stem cells from the central nervous system ( CNS ) has contributed to uncertainty regarding the relationship between qNSCs and NICs . SVZ NICs have been enriched by flow cytometry based on CD15 expression ( Capela and Temple , 2002 ) or ROS levels ( Le Belle et al . , 2011 ) . Multiple lines of evidence have demonstrated that NSCs express GFAP and that these cells sustainably contribute to neurogenesis in vivo ( Doetsch et al . , 1997 , 1999a , 1999b , 2002; Imura et al . , 2003; Morshead et al . , 2003; Garcia et al . , 2004; Mirzadeh et al . , 2008; Pastrana et al . , 2009; Beckervordersandforth et al . , 2010; Giachino et al . , 2013 ) . Pastrana et al . identified quiescent GFAP-GFP+EGFR\u2212 SVZ cells and speculated that these cells include NSCs that give rise to more mitotically active GFAP-GFP+EGFR+ and GFAP-GFP-EGFR+ NICs but did not test this by fate-mapping ( Pastrana et al . , 2009 ) . In contrast , it has been suggested that nearly all GFAP-GFP+CD133+ cells are NICs and that these cells are the qNSCs in the SVZ ( Beckervordersandforth et al . , 2010 ) . Efforts toward prospective identification have therefore generated conflicting results about whether NICs are quiescent or mitotically active in vivo and regarding their relationship to NSCs . We have identified regulators of CNS stem cell self-renewal based on their ability to regulate SVZ proliferation and neurogenesis in vivo as well as multipotent NIC self-renewal in culture ( Molofsky et al . , 2003 , 2006; Nishino et al . , 2008; Chuikov et al . , 2010 ) . However , an important question that we have not been able to address directly is whether those genes are necessary for NSC maintenance in vivo . Impaired NIC self-renewal in culture may not reflect reduced NSC self-renewal in vivo ( Joseph and Morrison , 2005; He et al . , 2009 ) . For example , the polycomb transcriptional repressor Bmi-1 is thought to be required for NSC self-renewal ( Molofsky et al . , 2003; Bruggeman et al . , 2005; Molofsky et al . , 2005; Zencak et al . , 2005; Bruggeman et al . , 2007; Fasano et al . , 2009 ) . However , these studies were performed in germline knockout mice that generally die within a month after birth ( van der Lugt et al . , 1994; Jacobs et al . , 1999; Lessard and Sauvageau , 2003; Park et al . , 2003 ) . Thus , it has not been possible to test whether Bmi-1 is autonomously required by NSCs in the adult brain or whether NSCs differ from NICs in their dependence upon Bmi-1 . Here we report the prospective identification of two phenotypically and functionally distinct populations of cells in the SVZ: GEPCOT cells and pre-GEPCOT cells . The pre-GEPCOTs accounted for 6 \u00b1 3% of adult mouse SVZ cells , were highly quiescent , lacked the ability to form neurospheres or adherent colonies in culture , and included type B1 cells based on marker expression , morphology , and position in vivo . These cells contained long-lived qNSCs based on both fate mapping and temozolomide resistance . GEPCOTs were distinguished by lower GFAP and Glast expression and higher EGFR and PlexinB2 expression . These cells accounted for 3 . 2 \u00b1 0 . 7% of cells in the adult mouse SVZ , were highly mitotically active , highly enriched for NICs , and included type C cells based on marker expression , morphology , and position in vivo . Based on fate-mapping these cells were short-lived in the SVZ . Our data thus provide methods to prospectively identify and distinguish qNSCs from NICs . \n We enzymatically dissociated adult mouse SVZ cells then sorted cells by flow cytometry into non-adherent cultures at clonal density ( 0 . 66 cells/\u00b5l of culture medium ) . We always replated neurospheres to adherent secondary cultures to assess differentiation into TuJ1+ neurons , GFAP+ astrocytes , and O4+ oligodendrocytes . On average , 1 . 8 \u00b1 0 . 4% of SVZ cells formed neurospheres ( >50 \u00b5m diameter ) and 75% of those neurospheres underwent multilineage differentiation ( 1 . 4 \u00b1 0 . 3% of SVZ cells ) . We systematically screened 383 antibodies against 330 distinct cell surface antigens ( Supplementary file 1A ) to identify markers that could enrich NICs ( Figure 1A ) . We identified 49 markers by flow cytometry that were heterogeneously expressed among dissociated SVZ cells . For each of these markers we sorted SVZ cells that differed in their level of staining into non-adherent cultures and assessed neurosphere formation . We found 17 markers that enriched NICs relative to unfractionated SVZ cells ( Supplementary file 1A ) . We multiplexed combinations of these markers to optimize enrichment while ensuring that most NICs were retained within the sorted population . 10 . 7554/eLife . 02669 . 003Figure 1 .

Isolating GEPCOT cells by flow cytometry . ( A ) Side scatter ( SSC ) and forward scatter ( FSC ) were gated to eliminate debris . The parameters of this gate can be set using mouse bone marrow as shown in the first panel such that myeloid cells fall in the center of the plot . FSC threshold was increased to eliminate as much debris as possible without eliminating cells ( this can be checked by sorting events onto a microscope slide and then checking by microscopy to determine whether the events include cells or debris ) . These steps ensure reproducibility across days in spite of extensive debris in SVZ cell preparations . Sucrose density centrifugation ( approximately 90% debris reduction ) or myelin depletion using paramagnetic myelin-binding microbeads ( Miltenyi Biotec , 130-096-733 , approximately \u223c95\u201398% debris reduction ) greatly reduce debris but also reduce cell yield by \u223c50\u201360% . ( B ) The sixth gate ( CD24/Glast ) is drawn using the \u2018live SVZ cells\u2019 population as a guide . On a plot of Glast vs CD24 , live SVZ cells should have two clearly resolved populations that are either CD24mid or CD24\u2212/low . The CD24 gate excludes all the CD24mid cells and retains all the CD24\u2212/low cells . ( C ) Most NICs and multipotent NICs were contained in the GEPCOT population , which was 20-fold enriched for NICs relative to unfractionated SVZ cells . The remaining non-GEPCOT cells were threefold depleted for NICs relative to unfractionated SVZ cells . Data represent mean \u00b1 SD from 11 ( neurospheres >50 \u03bcm ) or 5 ( multipotent neurospheres ) independent experiments . Significance was assessed using two-tailed t tests ( ** , p<0 . 01; *** , p<0 . 001 ) . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 02669 . 004 We greatly enriched NICs by isolating live ( 4\u2032 , 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole ( DAPI ) negative ) SVZ cells that expressed moderate levels of Glast , high levels of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor ( EGFR ) , high levels of PlexinB2 , negative to low levels of CD24 , negative to low levels of O4 and PSA-NCAM , and were negative for the hematopoietic markers Ter119 and CD45 . We refer to these GlastmidEGFRhighPlexinB2highCD24\u2212/lowO4/PSA-NCAM\u2212/lowTer119/CD45\u2212 cells as GEPCOT cells ( Figure 1B , Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A , B ) . GEPCOTs accounted for 3 . 2 \u00b1 0 . 7% of all SVZ cells ( Figure 1B ) . On average , 36 \u00b1 6% of GEPCOT cells formed neurospheres ( >50 \u00b5m diameter ) and 74% of those neurospheres underwent multilineage differentiation ( Figure 1C ) . Nearly all of the neurospheres ( 91% ) could be passaged ( data not shown ) . On average , each neurosphere gave rise to 53 \u00b1 41 multipotent secondary neurospheres upon dissociation and replating , demonstrating self-renewal potential . Most NICs from the SVZ were contained within this GEPCOT population ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C ) . Given that individual NICs are unlikely to form colonies with 100% efficiency after dissociation and flow cytometry , most GEPCOT cells likely have the potential to form neurospheres . The ability to prospectively identify NICs made it possible to assess their cell cycle distribution in vivo by administering bromodeoxyuridine ( BrdU ) to mice . After just a 2 hour pulse of BrdU , 35 \u00b1 2% of GEPCOTs were already BrdU+ as compared to only 11 \u00b1 4% of unfractionated SVZ cells ( Figure 1D ) . Longer pulses of BrdU progressively increased the labeling of the GEPCOT cells . After a 24-hr pulse of BrdU , 89 \u00b1 4% of GEPCOTs were BrdU+ as compared to 47 \u00b1 9% of unfractionated SVZ cells ( Figure 1D ) . GEPCOTs are thus highly mitotically active and enriched for dividing cells relative to unfractionated SVZ cells . The observation that nearly all GEPCOTs incorporated BrdU within 24 hr indicates that few , if any , GEPCOTs are quiescent and that NICs are highly proliferative in vivo . To assess the persistence of NICs in vivo we performed a series of lineage tracing experiments . Guided by previous observations ( Doetsch et al . , 2002; Ahn and Joyner , 2005; Arnold et al . , 2011; Kim et al . , 2011; Taniguchi et al . , 2011; Lee et al . , 2012; Wang et al . , 2012 ) we screened candidate CreERT2 alleles for the ability to recombine a conditional Rosa26-loxp-tdTomato reporter within NICs in vivo after 5 consecutive days of tamoxifen injection ( Figure 2A; 80 mg/kg body mass/day i . p . ) . We found that Dlx1CreERT2 ( Taniguchi et al . , 2011 ) , Ascl1CreERT2 ( Kim et al . , 2011 ) , Gli1CreERT2 ( Ahn and Joyner , 2005 ) , Slc1a3-CreERT ( Wang et al . , 2012 ) , and Sox2CreERT2 ( Arnold et al . , 2011 ) labeled 11\u201394% of NICs 2 days after tamoxifen administration ( Figure 2B\u2013F ) . With each Cre allele and at earch time point , the frequency of tdTomato+ GEPCOTs was statistically indistinguishable from the frequency of tdTomato+ neurospheres that arose in culture from unfractionated SVZ cells ( Figure 2B\u2013F ) . This independently confirms that GEPCOT markers reliably identify uncultured cells with the ability to form neurospheres . 10 . 7554/eLife . 02669 . 005Figure 2 . Individual NICs persist only transiently within the SVZ in vivo but are constantly replenished by more primitive neural stem cells . ( A ) Mice bearing inducible Cre alleles and the Rosa26-loxp-tdTomato conditional reporter were induced with 5 consecutive days of tamoxifen injections ( 80 mg/kg/day ) then chased for 2 to 60 days before analysis of the percentage of labeled SVZ cells or GEPCOT cells in vivo or the percentage of labeled neurospheres ( >50 \u00b5m ) in culture . ( B\u2013F ) Cells marked by recombination of Dlx1CreERT2 ( B , n = 4\u20137 mice/time point in four independent experiments ) , Ascl1CreERT2 ( C , n = 3 or 4 mice/time point in three independent experiments ) , Gli1CreERT2 ( D ) , Slc1a3-CreERT ( E ) , or Sox2CreERT2 ( F , n = 3\u20134 mice/time point in four independent experiments for D\u2013F ) .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 02669 . 005 To assess the persistence of NICs in vivo we quantified the frequencies of all SVZ cells , GEPCOTs , and neurospheres that were tdTomato+ at 2 , 7 , 28 , or 60 days after tamoxifen treatment . In the absence of tamoxifen we detected no tdTomato expression in SVZ cells , GEPCOTs , or cultured neurospheres in Dlx1CreERT2 mice ( Figure 2B ) . 2 days after tamoxifen treatment , Dlx1CreERT2 labeled 51 \u00b1 6% of SVZ cells , 15 \u00b1 6% of GEPCOTs , and 11 \u00b1 4% of neurospheres ( Figure 2B ) . 7 days after tamoxifen this significantly ( p<0 . 001 ) declined to 8 \u00b1 5% of SVZ cells , 0 . 7 \u00b1 0 . 9% of GEPCOTs , and 0 . 9 \u00b1 1% of neurospheres ( Figure 2B ) . 28 days after tamoxifen only rare SVZ cells , GEPCOTs , and neurospheres were labeled ( Figure 2B ) . Dlx1CreERT2-expressing NICs thus persist in vivo for less than 7 days . Ascl1CreERT2 labeled most GEPCOTs and neurospheres . In the absence of tamoxifen , only 0 . 02% of SVZ cells , and no GEPCOTs or neurospheres , were tdTomato+ ( Figure 2C ) . 2 days after tamoxifen , Ascl1CreERT2 labeled 34 \u00b1 7% of SVZ cells , 63 \u00b1 8% of GEPCOTs , and 64 \u00b1 6% of neurospheres ( Figure 2C ) . 7 days after tamoxifen a similar fraction of SVZ cells remained tdTomato+ ( 35 \u00b1 3% ) but the fraction of labeled GEPCOTs and neurospheres significantly ( p<0 . 01 ) declined to 40 \u00b1 4% and 45 \u00b1 3% , respectively ( Figure 2C ) . 28 days after tamoxifen only 16 \u00b1 0 . 9% of SVZ cells , 16 \u00b1 0 . 6% of GEPCOTs , and 19 \u00b1 1 . 0% of neurospheres were labeled . This further decreased to 7 . 5 \u00b1 1 . 2% of SVZ cells , 12 \u00b1 0 . 8% of GEPCOTs , and 8 \u00b1 3% of neurospheres at 60 days after tamoxifen ( Figure 2C ) . This demonstrates that most Ascl1CreERT2-expressing NICs persist in vivo for less than 28 days . In contrast to cells labeled with Dlx1CreERT2 or Ascl1CreERT2 , cells labeled with Gli1CreERT2 , Slc1a3-CreERT , or Sox2CreERT2 exhibited a sustained contribution to the pools of SVZ cells , GEPCOTs , and NICs for at least 60 days after tamoxifen administration ( Figure 2D\u2013F ) . This suggested the existence of a long-lived NSC population in the SVZ that replenishes NICs and is marked by Gli1CreERT2 , Slc1a3-CreERT , and Sox2CreERT2 expression ( Figure 2G ) . To test whether there is an earlier stem cell population in the SVZ we sought a CreERT2 allele that recombines in long-lived NSCs but not in NICs . Since prior studies have implicated GFAP as a marker of type B cells and NSCs in the adult SVZ ( Doetsch et al . , 1997 , 1999a , 2002; Mirzadeh et al . , 2008; Giachino and Taylor , 2009; Giachino et al . , 2013 ) we performed lineage-tracing experiments with GFAP-CreERT2 ( Hirrlinger et al . , 2006 ) . In the absence of tamoxifen , only 0 . 02% of SVZ cells , and no GEPCOTs or neurospheres , were tdTomato+ ( Figure 3A ) . 2 days after tamoxifen treatment , GFAP-CreERT2 labeled only 5 \u00b1 0 . 6% of SVZ cells , 7 \u00b1 2% of GEPCOTs , and 8 \u00b1 0 . 9% of neurospheres ( Figure 3A ) . 7 days after tamoxifen this increased significantly ( p<0 . 05 ) to 11 \u00b1 4 . 3% of SVZ cells , 19 \u00b1 5 . 5% of GEPCOTs , and 18 \u00b1 6 . 1% of neurospheres ( Figure 3A ) . By 28 days after tamoxifen this further increased to 26 \u00b1 3 . 7% of SVZ cells , 32 \u00b1 4 . 7% of GEPCOTs , and 35 \u00b1 7 . 2% of neurospheres ( Figure 3A ) . At 60 days after tamoxifen we observed 23 \u00b1 2 . 6% of SVZ cells , 34 \u00b1 8 . 0% of GEPCOTs , and 37 \u00b1 4 . 2% of neurospheres labeled ( Figure 3A ) . GFAP-CreERT2-expressing NSCs thus make a sustained and growing contribution to the SVZ , in contrast to NICs labeled by Dlx1CreERT2 or Ascl1CreERT2 . 10 . 7554/eLife . 02669 . 006Figure 3 . Identification of a pre-GEPCOT population that gives rise to GEPCOT NICs in vivo . ( A ) GFAP-CreERT2; Rosa26-loxp-tdTomato mice were induced with tamoxifen for 5 days , chased for 2 to 60 days without tamoxifen , then conditional reporter expression was analyzed in all SVZ cells , GEPCOTs , and cultured neurospheres ( n = 3\u20135 mice/time point in four independent experiments ) . ( B\u2013D ) GFAP-CreERT2; Rosa26-loxp-tdTomato mice were analyzed by flow cytometry to quantify reporter expression in SVZ cells without tamoxifen ( B ) , at 2 days ( C ) or 28 days ( D ) after tamoxifen treatment . ( B ) Without tamoxifen , virtually no SVZ cells expressed the reporter . For comparison to C and D , control SVZ cells are shown stained for Glast and EGFR as well as the distribution of the GlasthighEGFR\u2212/low fraction with respect to PlexinB2 and O4/PSA-NCAM staining . ( C ) 2 days after tamoxifen , the tdTomato+ cells labeled by recombination by the GFAP-CreERT2 stem cell marker were GlasthighEgfr\u2212/lowPlexinB2midCD24\u2212/lowO4/PSA-NCAM\u2212/lowTer119/Cd45\u2212 ( CD24 expression is not shown here ) , which we describe as \u2018pre-GEPCOT\u2019 cells .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 02669 . 006 To better characterize the GFAP-CreERT2-expressing SVZ cells we examined the surface markers expressed by tdTomato+ cells 2 days after tamoxifen treatment of GFAP-CreERT2; Rosa26-loxp-tdTomato mice . By flow cytometry , tdTomato+ cells were highly enriched for GlasthighEGFR\u2212/lowPlexinB2midCD24\u2212/lowO4/PSA-NCAM\u2212/lowTer119/CD45\u2212 ( pre-GEPCOT ) cells ( Figure 3B\u2013D ) . These cells differed from GEPCOT cells in that they exhibited higher levels of Glast and lower levels of EGFR and PlexinB2 expression . pre-GEPCOT cells made up only 6 \u00b1 3% of all SVZ cells ( Figure 3E ) and yet , based on GFAP-CreERT2 lineage tracing , gave rise to many SVZ cells , GEPCOTs , and NICs within 28 days of tamoxifen treatment ( Figure 3A ) . The GFAP-CreERT2-expressing pre-GEPCOTs therefore included NSCs with a much greater capacity to contribute to the SVZ than Ascl1CreERT2-expressing NICs . To confirm this we sorted pre-GEPCOT cells to test whether they stain with an anti-GFAP antibody . GFAP expression was heterogeneous within the pre-GEPCOT population , with 21 \u00b1 7% being GFAPhigh and 33 \u00b1 2% being GFAPlow ( Figure 4A ) . This suggests that the pre-GEPCOT population is much more highly enriched for NSCs as compared to unfractionated SVZ cells , which contained only 2 \u00b1 1% GFAPhigh cells and 6 \u00b1 3% GFAPlow cells ( both p<0 . 01 relative to pre-GEPCOT cells; Figure 4A ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 02669 . 007Figure 4 . GFAP-expressing pre-GEPCOT cells are quiescent in vivo but make an enduring contribution to the SVZ .

( B ) The frequencies of neurospheres >50 \u03bcm , multipotent neurospheres , adherent colonies , and multipotent adherent colonies ( 4\u20136 independent experiments each ) formed by unfractionated live SVZ cells , GEPCOTs , and pre-GEPCOTs . ( C ) Frequency of BrdU+ SVZ cells or pre-GEPCOT cells after BrdU pulses in vivo ( n = 5\u201311 mice/time point in 2\u20133 independent experiments; note that SVZ data are from Figure 1D for comparison purposes but were obtained in the same experiments ) . ( D\u2013H ) Conditional reporter expression in pre-GEPCOT cells at varying times after recombination with the indicated Cre alleles . These data are from the same fate-mapping experiments as shown in Figures 2 and 3 , including the same SVZ data for comparison purposes . Cre alleles that only transiently contributed to the SVZ ( Dlx1CreERT2 and Ascl1CreERT2 ) did not recombine in pre-GEPCOT cells , while Cre alleles that gave enduring contributions to the SVZ ( Gli1CreERT2 , Slc1a3-CreERT , and Sox2CreERT2 ) did recombine in pre-GEPCOT cells . ( I\u2013J ) The frequencies and numbers of labeled pre-GEPCOT cells , GEPCOT cells , neuroblasts , and other SVZ cells at varying times after recombination by GFAP-CreERT2 ( n = 3\u20135 mice/time point in four independent experiments ) . ( K ) Markers that distinguish pre-GEPCOT from GEPCOT cells . ( L\u2013M ) Whole-mount SVZs were stained with anti-acetylated tubulin ( red ) , anti-\u03b2-catenin ( blue ) , and either anti-GFAP ( L , green ) or anti-EGFR ( M , green ) antibodies and pinwheel structures were inspected for the presence of GFAPhigh pre-GEPCOT cells ( open arrow in L and M ) and EGFRhigh GEPCOT cells ( hatched arrow in M ) by confocal microscopy . Images were taken at the apical surface except the GFAP depth projection which is a composite of 11 images at 2 \u03bcm intervals into the tissue . Scale bar = 5 \u03bcm . All data represent mean \u00b1 SD . Statistical significance of differences between SVZ and pre-GEPCOT cells in C was assessed with two-tailed student's t tests . Statistical significance of differences in D\u2013J ( among time points ) was tested with a one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's post-hoc tests for multiple comparisons . *p<0 . 05 , **p<0 . 01 , ***p<0 . 001 , n . s . not significant . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 02669 . 007 Whereas GEPCOTs were highly enriched for multipotent NICs ( Figure 1C ) , pre-GEPCOTs were unable to form neurospheres . We sorted unfractionated SVZ cells into culture and found that 1 . 9 \u00b1 0 . 5% of the cells formed neurospheres and 2 . 0 \u00b1 0 . 4% formed adherent colonies ( Figure 4B ) . Under the same conditions 32 \u00b1 7% of GEPCOTs formed neurospheres and 38 \u00b1 13% formed adherent colonies ( Figure 4B ) . In contrast , only very rare pre-GEPCOT cells formed neurospheres ( 1/1663 cells ) and only 0 . 3 \u00b1 0 . 4% ( 9/1973 cells ) formed adherent colonies ( Figure 4B ) . To assess whether pre-GEPCOT cells are quiescent or frequently dividing in vivo , we administered pulses of BrdU . Although 47 \u00b1 9% of SVZ cells and 89 \u00b1 4% of GEPCOT cells ( Figure 1D ) incorporated a 24-hr pulse of BrdU in these experiments , only 3 \u00b1 3% of pre-GEPCOT cells incorporated BrdU in the same mice ( Figure 4C ) . Similarly , 60 \u00b1 6% of SVZ cells and 91 \u00b1 3% of GEPCOT cells ( Figure 1D ) incorporated a 2-week pulse of BrdU in these experiments , but only 4 \u00b1 2% of pre-GEPCOT cells incorporated BrdU ( Figure 4C ) . These data indicate that pre-GEPCOT cells are quiescent in the SVZ . To assess whether fate-mapping with CreERT2 alleles is consistent with the existence of a pre-GEPCOT qNSC population we assessed whether they recombined in pre-GEPCOT cells . Dlx1CreERT2 , which labeled 51 \u00b1 6% of all SVZ cells and 15 \u00b1 6% of GEPCOTs at 2 days after tamoxifen treatment ( Figure 2B ) , did not label any pre-GEPCOT cells at 2 , 7 , or 28 days after tamoxifen treatment ( Figure 4D ) . Ascl1CreERT2 , which labeled 34 \u00b1 7% of all SVZ cells and 63 \u00b1 8% of GEPCOTs at 2 days after tamoxifen ( Figure 2C ) , labeled fewer than 1% of pre-GEPCOT cells at 2 , 7 , 28 , and 60 days after tamoxifen ( Figure 4E ) . Thus , both of the CreERT2 alleles that exhibited declining contributions to the SVZ upon fate-mapping labeled GEPCOTs but not pre-GEPCOTs . Neither the Dlx1CreERT2-expressing GEPCOT NICs nor the Ascl1CreERT2-expressing GEPCOT NICs gave rise to significant numbers of pre-GEPCOT qNSCs in vivo , at least under steady-state conditions . To assess whether pre-GEPCOTs contain qNSCs we tested whether the CreERT2 alleles that sustainably contributed to the SVZ over time ( Gli1CreERT2 , Slc1a3-CreERT , and Sox2CreERT2 ) labeled pre-GEPCOT cells . Gli1CreERT2 , which sustainably labeled 8\u201319% of all SVZ cells and 26\u201340% of GEPCOTs for 60 days after tamoxifen treatment ( Figure 2D ) , also sustainably labeled 7\u201313% of pre-GEPCOT cells at 2 to 60 days after tamoxifen treatment ( Figure 4F ) . Slc1a3-CreERT , which sustainably labeled 21\u201348% of all SVZ cells and 61\u201372% of GEPCOTs for 60 days after tamoxifen ( Figure 2E ) , also labeled 31\u201336% of pre-GEPCOT cells 2 to 60 days after tamoxifen ( Figure 4G ) . Sox2CreERT2 , which sustainably labeled 49\u201365% of all SVZ cells and 92\u201397% of GEPCOTs for 60 days after tamoxifen ( Figure 2F ) , also sustainably labeled 87\u201393% of pre-GEPCOT cells 2 to 60 days after tamoxifen ( Figure 4H ) . Thus all of the CreERT2 alleles that gave a sustained contribution to NIC and SVZ labeling also labeled pre-GEPCOTs , consistent with the suggestion that pre-GEPCOT cells contain qNSCs . Moreover , every CreERT2 allele that labeled pre-GEPCOT cells exhibited sustained labeling of not only pre-GEPCOT cells but also GEPCOTs , NICs , and unfractionated SVZ cells . We tested whether the GFAP-CreERT2 recombination pattern was consistent with pre-GEPCOT qNSCs giving rise to GEPCOT NICs in vivo . 2 days after tamoxifen administration to GFAP-CreERT2; Rosa26-loxp-tdTomato mice , the tdTomato label was present mainly in pre-GEPCOT cells . On average , 29 \u00b1 7% of pre-GEPCOT cells were tdTomato+ whereas only 6 . 7 \u00b1 1 . 9% of GEPCOT cells , 2 . 2 \u00b1 0 . 5% of PSA-NCAMhighCD24mid neuroblasts ( Pastrana et al . , 2009 ) , and 3 . 0 \u00b1 0 . 8% of other SVZ cells were labeled ( Figure 4I ) . These data indicate that GFAP-CreERT2 recombines efficiently in pre-GEPCOTs but not GEPCOT NICs in vivo . 28 days after tamoxifen treatment , the percentage of labeled pre-GEPCOT cells increased to 44 \u00b1 5 . 8% of cells ( Figure 4I ) . The percentages of labeled GEPCOTs , neuroblasts , and other SVZ cells also increased significantly ( p<0 . 01 ) by 28 days\u201332 \u00b1 4 . 7% , 35 \u00b1 6 . 8% , and 20 \u00b1 2 . 2% , respectively . At 60 days after tamoxifen , we continued to observe strong labeling in pre-GEPCOTs , GEPCOTs , and neuroblasts ( Figure 4I ) . Similar trends were apparent when the data were expressed in absolute numbers ( Figure 4J ) . These data suggest GFAP-CreERT2-expressing pre-GEPCOT cells include qNSCs that give rise to NICs , neuroblasts , and other SVZ cells ( Figure 4K ) . We examined the localization of pre-GEPCOT and GEPCOT cells in whole mount stains of the SVZ . pre-GEPCOTs were distinguished by GFAP expression , a marker of type B cells ( Doetsch et al . , 1999a ) and GEPCOTs were distinguished by EGFR expression , a marker of type C cells ( Doetsch et al . , 2002 ) . We stained whole-mount SVZs with antibodies against acetylated tubulin and \u03b2-catenin to detect \u2018pinwheel\u2019 structures associated with type B1 stem cells in the SVZ ( Mirzadeh et al . , 2008 ) then also stained with antibodies against GFAP and EGFR . Consistent with prior results ( Mirzadeh et al . , 2008 ) , we observed GFAPhigh cells at the center of the pinwheel structures with a single primary cilium on the apical surface contacting the ventricle and a long basal process ( Figure 4L ) . Since many pre-GEPCOTs recombined with GFAP-CreERT2 but virtually no GEPCOTs did ( Figure 4I ) , these data indicate that many pre-GEPCOT cells have the morphology and position of type B1 cells in the SVZ . In contrast , EGFRhigh cells had type C cell morphology: round , unciliated , and generally not contacting the ventricle , consistent with Doetsch et al . ( 2002 ) ( Figure 4M ) . Since all GEPCOT cells express high levels of EGFR ( Figure 1B ) while pre-GEPCOT cells have low levels of EGFR ( Figure 3D ) , these data suggest that many GEPCOT cells have the morphology and position of type C cells . Our observation that pre-GEPCOT cells include qNSCs raised the question of whether pre-GEPCOT cells are resistant to anti-mitotic agents . To test this , we treated mice for 3 consecutive days with the CNS-penetrating DNA-alkylating agent temozolomide ( TMZ; 100 mg/kg/day i . p . ) ( Garthe et al . , 2009 ) then assessed SVZ proliferation , composition , and neurosphere formation 3 to 90 days later ( Figure 5A ) . 3 days after TMZ , mice appeared healthy and had lost less than 3% of their body mass as compared to before TMZ treatment ( data not shown ) . 3 days after TMZ treatment we observed a 23% reduction in the total number of cells per SVZ and this reduction remained nearly constant over the next 90 days ( Figure 5B ) . 3 days after TMZ we observed an 80% reduction in the number of dividing SVZ cells , based on BrdU incorporation ( Figure 5C , p<0 . 001 ) . The number of dividing SVZ cells slowly increased over time , recovering to 50% of normal by 90 days after TMZ treatment ( Figure 5C ) . 3 days after TMZ only 0 . 7% of the NICs observed in saline-treated control mice remained in TMZ-treated mice ( Figure 5D , p<0 . 001 ) . By 16 days after TMZ treatment NICs recovered to 20% of normal levels ( Figure 5D , p<0 . 001 ) . The numbers of NICs continued to increase over time , recovering to 55% of normal by 90 days after TMZ ( Figure 5D , p<0 . 001 ) . NICs are thus virtually completely eliminated by TMZ but regenerate over time as expected . 10 . 7554/eLife . 02669 . 008Figure 5 . Treatment with temozolomide does not affect the frequency of pre-GEPCOT cells but ablates GEPCOT NICs . ( A\u2013F ) Mice were injected with TMZ ( 100 mg/kg/day ) for three consecutive days to ablate dividing cells , then allowed to recover for 3 to 90 days before analysis ( TMZ 1x ) . All TMZ 1x data reflect 5\u20137 mice per time point from seven independent experiments . ( G\u2013L ) Alternatively , mice were serially treated with two doses of TMZ 12 days apart then allowed to recover for 3 to 90 days before analysis ( TMZ 2x ) . All TMZ 2x data reflect 4\u20139 mice per time point from six independent experiments . At each time point after TMZ treatment the panels show the total number of cells isolated per SVZ ( B and H ) , the number of SVZ cells per section that incorporated a 2 hr pulse of BrdU ( C and I ) , the number of multipotent neurospheres that arose in culture per SVZ ( D and J ) , the number of GEPCOTs per SVZ ( E and K ) , and the number of pre-GEPCOTs per SVZ ( F and L ) . ( M\u2013P ) Mice were injected with tamoxifen ( 80 mg/kg/day i . p . ) for 5 days , then with TMZ ( 100 mg/kg/day i . p . ) for 3 days , then recovered for 3 or 35 days to observe regeneration . The numbers of labeled GEPCOTs were measured after recombination with Ascl1CreERT2 ( N , 4 mice per condition from two independent experiments ) , Slc1a3-CreERT ( O , 5\u20136 mice per condition from three independent experiments ) , or GFAP-CreERT2 ( P , 4 mice per condition from two independent experiments ) . All data represent mean \u00b1 SD . Statistical significance was tested with a one-way ANOVA followed by Sidak's post-hoc test for the indicated comparisons in B\u2013F and H\u2013L . Statistical significance in N\u2013P was assessed with two-tailed student's t tests . *p<0 . 05 , **p<0 . 01 , ***p<0 . 001 , n . s . not significant . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 02669 . 008 Consistent with the effects of TMZ on NICs , TMZ treatment also eliminated nearly all GEPCOT cells . 3 days after TMZ treatment , only 10% of the GEPCOTs observed in saline-treated control mice remained in TMZ treated mice ( Figure 5E , p<0 . 001 ) . By 16 days after TMZ treatment , GEPCOTs recovered to 32% of normal levels ( Figure 5E , p<0 . 001 ) . GEPCOTs recovered to 55% of normal levels by 90 days after TMZ treatment ( Figure 5E , p<0 . 001 ) . The numbers of pre-GEPCOT cells in the SVZ were not affected by TMZ treatment ( Figure 5F ) . If pre-GEPCOT qNSCs regenerate NICs after TMZ treatment then serial TMZ treatment might be expected to deplete pre-GEPCOT cells . To test this we administered two rounds of TMZ 12 days apart ( Figure 5G ) . Under these circumstances , pre-GEPCOT cells were not depleted 3 days after the second round of TMZ treatment but they were depleted by 90 days after the second round of TMZ ( Figure 5L ) . Consistent with the observation that pre-GEPCOT cells were sensitive to serial TMZ treatment , we detected little recovery of dividing SVZ cells ( Figure 5I ) , NICs ( Figure 5J ) , or GEPCOTs ( Figure 5K ) after serial TMZ treatment . These data suggest that GEPCOT NICs are replenished after ablation by pre-GEPCOT qNSCs . To directly test whether GEPCOTs arise from pre-GEPCOT cells during SVZ regeneration we performed lineage tracing using multiple Cre alleles by first labeling cells with tamoxifen and then treating with TMZ ( Figure 5M ) . After recombination of a conditional reporter with the GEPCOT marker Ascl1CreERT2 , the number of unlabeled GEPCOTs per SVZ increased from 120 \u00b1 50 at 3 days after TMZ to 640 \u00b1 210 at 35 days after TMZ ( p<0 . 01 ) but Ascl1CreERT2-labeled GEPCOTs did not significantly change ( Figure 5N ) . The GEPCOTs , NICs , and neuroblasts that regenerated after TMZ treatment thus did not arise from Ascl1CreERT2-labeled GEPCOTs ( Figure 5N ) . In contrast , after recombination of a conditional reporter with the pre-GEPCOT markers Slc1a3-CreERT and GFAP-CreERT2 we observed significant ( p<0 . 05 ) increases in the frequencies of labeled GEPCOT cells , NICs , and neuroblasts between 3 and 35 days after TMZ treatment ( Figure 5O , P ) . These results strongly suggest that pre-GEPCOT cells give rise to GEPCOTs , NICs , and neuroblasts during SVZ regeneration . pre-GEPCOT qNSCs and GEPCOT NICs expressed similar levels of Bmi-1 by qRT-PCR ( Figure 6A ) . To study the molecular mechanisms that regulate the maintenance of pre-GEPCOT qNSCs and GEPCOT NICs in vivo we generated a floxed allele of Bmi-1 ( Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A , B ) and conditionally deleted Bmi-1 using Nestin-Cre ( Tronche et al . , 1999 ) . This allele of Nestin-Cre deletes broadly throughout the neuroepithelium by E10 . 5 such that there is nearly homogeneous recombination in the postnatal CNS ( http://cre . jax . org/Nes/Nes-CreNano . html ) . Consistent with this , Nestin-Cre; Bmi-1fl/fl mice exhibited a loss of Bmi-1 protein in the cortex and SVZ by western blot ( Figure 6B ) and a loss of Bmi-1 transcripts in SVZ cells , GEPCOT cells , and pre-GEPCOT cells by qRT-PCR ( Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1G ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 02669 . 009Figure 6 .

Targeting strategy for engineering a floxed allele of Bmi-1 for conditional deletion . ( A ) A bacterial artificial chromosome containing the mouse Bmi-1 gene ( RP23-145I3 ) , was modified to insert a loxP-FRT-Neo-FRT cassette 5\u2032 to exon 2 and a loxP site 3\u2032 to exon 3 to generate the targeting vector . These sites were selected to avoid disrupting conserved sequences , which are potential regulatory elements . Correctly targeted ES cells ( Bmi1fl-Neo ) were generated using W4 ES cells and identified by southern blotting ( B ) using 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 probes . After generating chimeric mice that gave germline transmission , Bmi1fl-Neo mice were mated with Flp deleter mice ( Rodriguez et al . , 2000 ) to remove the Neo cassette . The resulting Bmi-1fl mice were backcrossed for at least 10 generations onto a C57BL background . Cre recombination of this allele deletes the start codon and generates a frameshift mutation .

Unlike germline Bmi-1 deficient mice , which generally die within a month after birth ( van der Lugt et al . , 1994; Lessard and Sauvageau , 2003; Park et al . , 2003; Bruggeman et al . , 2005; Molofsky et al . , 2005 ) , we were able to age Nestin-Cre; Bmi-1fl/fl mice for up to 2 years . These mice did exhibit neurological deficits that worsened during aging , such as ataxia , as was reported in germline Bmi-1 deficient mice ( van der Lugt et al . , 1994 ) . However , the survival of Nestin-Cre; Bmi-1fl/fl mice throughout adulthood made it possible for the first time to test whether Bmi-1 is autonomously required by qNSCs or NICs in the adult brain . Consistent with the phenotype of germline Bmi-1 deficient mice ( van der Lugt et al . , 1994; Bruggeman et al . , 2005; Molofsky et al . , 2005 ) , brain morphology appeared relatively normal in Nestin-Cre; Bmi-1fl/fl mice ( Figure 6C , Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1E ) . Brain size was slightly but significantly reduced in Nestin-Cre; Bmi-1fl/fl mice as compared to littermate controls ( Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1D ) but was normal as a proportion of body mass ( data not shown ) . The cerebellums from Nestin-Cre; Bmi-1fl/fl mice were smaller than in control mice and had significantly thinner molecular layers ( Figure 6D , E ) . We also observed unusually prominent GFAP staining throughout the cortex of adult Nestin-Cre; Bmi-1fl/fl mice ( Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1F ) . Otherwise , the olfactory bulb , hippocampus , and cortex appeared grossly normal ( Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1E ) , though additional work will be required to carefully assess laminar organization and identity in each brain region . Our data suggest that the smaller cerebellums and prominent GFAP staining reflect a cell-autonomous requirement for Bmi-1 in fetal neural stem/progenitor cells . We observed complete Bmi-1 recombination in sorted SVZ cells , GEPCOT cells , and pre-GEPCOT cells isolated from adult Nestin-Cre; Bmi-1fl/fl mice ( Figure 6F ) . 12 month-old Nestin-Cre; Bmi-1fl/fl mice exhibited a significantly reduced number of SVZ cells that incorporated a 2-hr pulse of BrdU ( Figure 6G ) . We measured the rate of neurogenesis in Nestin-Cre; Bmi-1fl/fl mice and Bmi-1fl/fl controls by administering BrdU for 7 days ( beginning at 4 or 14 months of age ) followed by a 4-week chase without BrdU . We quantified the frequency of BrdU+NeuN+ newborn neurons in sections from the olfactory bulb by microscopy . Bmi-1 deletion had no effect on neurogenesis at 4 months of age , but significantly reduced olfactory bulb neurogenesis in 14-month-old mice ( Figure 6H , p<0 . 01 ) . Neurospheres formed by Nestin-Cre; Bmi-1fl/fl SVZ cells were significantly smaller than control neurospheres ( Figure 6I ) , were unable to undergo multilineage differentiation ( Figure 6J ) , and could not be passaged ( Figure 6K ) . In contrast , control neurospheres readily underwent multilineage differentiation ( Figure 6J ) and were able to generate multipotent daughter neurospheres upon subcloning into secondary cultures ( Figure 6K ) . To assess whether Bmi-1 deficiency affected pre-GEPCOT qNSCs or GEPCOT NICs in vivo we assessed the frequencies of these cells in SVZs from 4 and 12 month old Nestin-Cre; Bmi-1fl/fl mice and littermate controls . The frequency of pre-GEPCOT cells was significantly reduced at 4 months of age ( Figure 6L ) . We observed no significant effects on the frequencies of GEPCOT cells ( Figure 6M ) or neuroblasts ( Figure 6N ) at 4 months of age . However , each of these populations was significantly depleted in 12 month old Nestin-Cre; Bmi-1fl/fl mice ( Figure 6L\u2013N ) . Bmi-1 is thus required for the maintenance of normal numbers of pre-GEPCOT qNSCs and GEPCOT NICs in the adult brain . Nonetheless , some pre-GEPCOT cells , GEPCOT cells , and neurogenesis did persist for at least a year in adult mice , demonstrating that NSCs are not absolutely dependent upon Bmi-1 for their maintenance in the adult brain . Bmi-1 promotes the maintenance of neural stem cells partly by repressing the Cdkn2a ( p16Ink4a/p19Arf ) locus ( Jacobs et al . , 1999; Molofsky et al . , 2003 , 2005; Bruggeman et al . , 2007 ) . We were unable to detect Cdkn2a ( p16Ink4a ) transcripts in wild-type SVZ cells , pre-GEPCOT qNSCs , or GEPCOT NICs in 4-month-old ( 0/5 ) or 12 month old ( 0/5 ) mice ( Figure 6O ) . In contrast , 4-month old Bmi-1-deficient SVZ cells ( 5/5 mice ) and pre-GEPCOT cells ( 4/5 mice ) did express Cdkn2a ( p16Ink4a ) and the level of Cdkn2a ( p16Ink4a ) expression significantly increased between 4 and 12 months of age ( Figure 6O; detected in 5/5 mice for both populations ) . Low level Cdkn2a ( p16Ink4a ) expression was detected in GEPCOT cells from two of five 4 month-old Bmi-1-deficient mice and in GEPCOT cells from one of five 12 month old Bmi-1-deficient mice ( Figure 6O ) . Bmi-1 is thus required to repress Cdkn2a ( p16Ink4a ) expression in pre-GEPCOT qNSCs . To conditionally delete Bmi-1 in the adult brain we used Nestin-CreERT2 , which deletes broadly throughout the SVZ , including within qNSCs that give rise to SVZ cells after AraC treatment ( Giachino and Taylor , 2009 ) . We observed significantly lower levels of Nestin transcripts within pre-GEPCOT qNSCs as compared to GEPCOT NICs ( Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1A ) and only 9 . 3 \u00b1 7 . 3% of pre-GEPCOTs stained positively for Nestin protein as compared to 89 . 7 \u00b1 8 . 5% of GEPCOTs and 39 . 0 \u00b1 5 . 3% of SVZ cells ( Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1B ) . We also observed higher levels of Nestin transgene expression in GEPCOT cells as compared to pre-GEPCOT cells , including Nestin-mCherry and Nestin-GFP ( Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1C , D ) . However , when we analyzed recombination of a conditional reporter in Nestin-CreERT2 mice , we observed labeling of 99 \u00b1 1 . 1% of GEPCOT cells and 96 \u00b1 1 . 9% of pre-GEPCOT cells ( Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1E ) . Therefore , although endogenous Nestin is expressed at lower levels in qNSCs as compared to NICs , Nestin second intronic enhancer transgenes are variably expressed in both pre-GEPCOT qNSCs and GEPCOT NICs , and Nestin-CreERT2 gives nearly complete recombination in both cell populations . We administered tamoxifen in the chow of Nestin-CreERT2; Bmi-1fl/fl mice and littermate controls for 30 days beginning at 6 weeks of age and assessed recombination efficiency 2 weeks after completing tamoxifen treatment ( i . e . , starting at 3 months of age ) . Polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) analysis of genomic DNA from individual neurospheres revealed complete deletion of Bmi-1 in at least 95% of neurospheres ( Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2A , B ) . Western blot analysis demonstrated a near total loss of Bmi-1 protein from neurospheres ( Figure 7A ) , consistent with the high rate of recombination in individual neurospheres . By PCR analysis of genomic DNA we observed near complete recombination in unfractionated SVZ cells and complete recombination in pre-GEPCOT and GEPCOT cells isolated from adult Nestin-CreERT2; Bmi-1fl/fl mice ( Figure 7B ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 02669 . 011Figure 7 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 02669 . 013 Body mass ( Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2C ) , brain histology ( data not shown ) , and cerebellum size ( Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2D ) were all grossly normal in Nestin-CreERT2; Bmi-1fl/fl mice six months after tamoxifen treatment . To assess the consequences of Bmi-1 deletion from adult neural stem/progenitor cells , we measured the rate of neurogenesis in Nestin-CreERT2; Bmi-1fl/fl mice and Bmi-1fl/fl controls by administering BrdU for 7 days ( beginning at 2 weeks , 6 months and 12 months after tamoxifen treatment , at which time the mice were approximately 3 months old , 9 months old and 15 months old , respectively ) followed by a 4-week chase without BrdU . Bmi-1 deficiency had no effect on the frequency of BrdU+NeuN+ newborn neurons in the olfactory bulb 2 weeks after tamoxifen treatment but significantly reduced neurogenesis 6 and 12 months after tamoxifen ( Figure 7C , p<0 . 05 ) . The reduced neurogenesis in Bmi-1 mutant mice was evident in all subsets of neurons that we investigated , including BrdU+Calretinin+ neurons , BrdU+Calbindin+ neurons , and BrdU+Tyrosine Hydroxylase+ neurons ( Figure 7D , E ) . Bmi-1 is therefore required in adult neural stem/progenitor cells for normal neurogenesis but Bmi-1 deficiency did not completely eliminate the generation of forebrain neurons during the first year of life . Consistent with prior studies , the vast majority of the newborn cells in the adult olfactory bulb were neurons , but the small numbers of astrocytes that arose in the olfactory bulb and oligodendrocytes that arose in the cortex were also diminished after Bmi-1 deletion . The frequency of newborn olfactory bulb BrdU+S100\u03b2+ astrocytes appeared normal 6 months after tamoxifen treatment but was significantly reduced 12 months after tamoxifen in Bmi-1 mutant mice ( Figure 7F ) . The frequency of newborn cortical BrdU+GST-pi+ oligodendrocytes declined 6 months after tamoxifen treatment and could no longer be detected after 12 months ( Figure 7G ) . The deficits in neurogenesis and gliogenesis became worse over time after Bmi-1 deletion . We quantified the frequency of SVZ cells that incorporated a 2-hr pulse of BrdU . Bmi-1 mutant mice had significant reductions in the frequencies of BrdU+ SVZ cells at 2 weeks ( 50% reduction , p<0 . 02 ) , 6 months ( 55% reduction , p<0 . 02 ) and 12 months ( 90% reduction , p<0 . 001 ) after tamoxifen treatment ( Figure 7H ) . Bmi-1 mutant mice also had significant ( p<0 . 001 ) reductions in the frequencies of Mcm2+ ( Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2E , G ) and Ki67+ ( Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2F ) SVZ cells . Consistent with this , Bmi-1 mutant mice exhibited significant ( p<0 . 001 ) declines in the frequencies of Dcx+ ( Figure 7I ) and CD24midPSA-NCAM+ neuroblasts ( Figure 7J ) 6 and 12 months after tamoxifen treatment . To assess whether Bmi-1 is required by adult NICs we plated SVZ cells from tamoxifen-treated Nestin-CreERT2; Bmi-1fl/fl and control mice in non-adherent cultures and assessed GEPCOT cell frequency . 2 weeks after tamoxifen treatment the frequencies of NICs ( Figure 7K ) and GEPCOTs ( Figure 7Q ) were unchanged in Bmi-1 mutant mice as compared to littermate controls . However , the Bmi-1-deficient neurospheres were significantly smaller than control neurospheres ( Figure 7L , M ) and did not undergo multilineage differentiation ( Figure 7N; they formed only astrocytes upon transfer to adherent cultures ) or self-renew upon subcloning ( Figure 7O ) . At 6 and 12 months after tamoxifen treatment , Bmi-1 deficient SVZ cells formed virtually no neurospheres ( Figure 7K ) . Consistent with this , Nestin-CreERT2; Bmi-1fl/fl mice also had significantly lower frequencies of GEPCOTs than control mice at 6 months and 12 months after tamoxifen treatment , and the magnitude of the depletion increased over time ( Figure 7Q ) . Virtually no GEPCOTs could be found in Nestin-CreERT2; Bmi-1fl/fl mice 12 months after tamoxifen treatment ( Figure 7Q ) . These data demonstrate that GEPCOT NICs require Bmi-1 in vivo for their maintenance in the adult SVZ , though the cells are able to persist for several months after Bmi-1 deletion before they are completely eliminated . To test whether qNSCs depend upon Bmi-1 for their maintenance in vivo we examined the frequency of pre-GEPCOT cells in tamoxifen-treated Nestin-CreERT2; Bmi-1fl/fl mice and littermate controls . pre-GEPCOT cells were not depleted at 2 weeks or 6 months after tamoxifen treatment ( Figure 7P ) . We observed a clear trend toward reduced pre-GEPCOT cell frequency in Nestin-CreERT2; Bmi-1fl/fl mice 12 months after tamoxifen treatment but the effect was not statistically significant . To test whether there was a loss of Bmi-1 function in these cells we performed qRT-PCR to assess Cdkn2a ( p16Ink4a ) expression in cells from Nestin-CreERT2; Bmi-1fl/fl mice . One mechanism by which Bmi-1 promotes the maintenance of neural stem/progenitor cells is by negatively regulating Cdkn2a ( p16Ink4a ) expression ( Jacobs et al . , 1999; Molofsky et al . , 2003; Bruggeman et al . , 2005; Molofsky et al . , 2005 ) . We did not detect Cdkn2a ( p16Ink4a ) transcripts in wild-type SVZ cells , pre-GEPCOT qNSCs , or GEPCOT NICs 2 weeks ( 0/5 ) , 3 months ( 0/6 ) , or 8 months ( 0/7 ) after tamoxifen treatment ( Figure 7R ) . We rarely detected Cdkn2a ( p16Ink4a ) transcripts in SVZ cells or GEPCOT cells from Nestin-CreERT2; Bmi-1fl/fl mice 2 weeks ( 0/5 SVZ , 0/5 GEPCOT ) , 3 months ( 0/5 SVZ , 1/5 GEPCOT ) or 8 months ( 1/9 SVZ , 0/9 GEPCOT ) after tamoxifen treatment . Cdkn2a ( p16Ink4a ) transcripts were rarely detected in pre-GEPCOT cells from Nestin-CreERT2; Bmi-1fl/fl mice 2 weeks ( 0/5 ) or 3 months ( 1/5 ) after tamoxifen treatment . However , 8 months after tamoxifen treatment Cdkn2a ( p16Ink4a ) expression was detected in pre-GEPCOT cells from seven of nine Nestin-CreERT2; Bmi-1fl/fl mice ( Figure 7R , Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2H ) . These data demonstrate that Bmi-1 is required during adulthood to negatively regulate Cdkn2a ( p16Ink4a ) expression in pre-GEPCOT qNSCs but that these cells are depleted more slowly than GEPCOT NICs in the adult SVZ . Although high levels of Cdkn2a ( p16Ink4a ) expression are associated with cellular senescence , we were unable to detect any increase in senescence associated \u03b2-galactosidase activity in pre-GEPCOT cells from 14 month old Nestin-Cre; Bmi-1fl/fl mice or in cultured neural stem/progenitor cells from Bmi-1 germline deficient mice ( data not shown ) . \n By screening almost 400 antibodies against distinct cell surface antigens we identified two phenotypically and functionally distinct populations of neural stem/progenitor cells from the adult mouse SVZ ( Figure 8 ) . GEPCOT cells were highly enriched for NICs ( Figure 1C ) and highly mitotically active in vivo ( Figure 1D ) but persisted only transiently in the SVZ based on fate mapping with Ascl1CreERT2 or Dlx1CreERT2 ( Figure 2B , C ) . In contrast , pre-GEPCOT cells lacked the ability to form neurospheres or adherent colonies in culture ( Figure 4B ) , and were quiescent in vivo ( Figure 4C ) but were long-lived in the SVZ based on fate mapping with the stem cell markers Slc1a3-CreERT ( Wang et al . , 2012 ) , GFAP-CreERT2 ( Giachino et al . , 2013 ) , Sox2CreERT2 ( Arnold et al . , 2011 ) , and Gli1CreERT2 ( Ahn and Joyner , 2005; Lee et al . , 2012 ) ( Figure 4F\u2013J ) . In contrast to GEPCOT NICs , pre-GEPCOT cells were resistant to TMZ ( Figure 5E , F ) . Although TMZ eliminated virtually all NICs from the SVZ ( Figure 5D ) , the dividing cells , NICs , and GEPCOTs regenerated within a month of TMZ treatment ( Figure 5 ) . The persistence of pre-GEPCOT cells after TMZ ( Figure 5F ) , and the regeneration of GEPCOTs from a precursor that expresses Slc1a3-CreERT and GFAP-CreERT2 but not Ascl1CreERT2 ( Figure 5N\u2013P ) suggest that the SVZ regenerates from pre-GEPCOT qNSCs . 10 . 7554/eLife . 02669 . 014Figure 8 . Phenotypically and functionally distinct populations of pre-GEPCOT qNSCs and GEPCOT NICs . GlasthighEGFR\u2212/lowPlexinB2midCD24\u2212/lowO4/PSA-NCAM\u2212/lowTer119/CD45\u2212 pre-GEPCOT cells are a quiescent , TMZ resistant population containing qNSCs that give rise to GlastmidEGFRhighPlexinB2highCD24\u2212/lowO4/PSA-NCAM\u2212/lowTer119/CD45\u2212 GEPCOT cells that are highly mitotically active in vivo and enriched for NICs . pre-GEPCOT cells include Type B1 cells , GEPCOT cells include Type C cells , and neuroblasts make up Type A SVZ cells ( Doetsch et al . , 1997; Doetsch et al . , 1999a ) . Bars for different Cre alleles represent the extent of recombination observed after 5 consecutive days of tamoxifen treatment followed by a 2 day chase . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 02669 . 014 The conclusion that pre-GEPCOT cells include qNSCs is also supported by the sustained contribution of GFAP-CreERT2 marked cells to the SVZ , as GFAP-CreERT2 labeled many pre-GEPCOT cells but few GEPCOT cells or NICs immediately after tamoxifen treatment ( Figure 3A , Figure 4I ) . Thus , our data demonstrate that GFAP-CreERT2 recombination is a marker of qNSCs that survive treatment with anti-mitotic agents and contribute to an increasing proportion of pre-GEPCOT cells , GEPCOT cells , and neuroblasts over time ( Figures 4I and 5M\u2013P ) . NSCs are commonly estimated to account for a few percent of cells in germinal zones in the adult mouse brain ( Doetsch et al . , 1997; Mirzadeh et al . , 2008; Pastrana et al . , 2009 ) . Although pre-GEPCOT cells accounted for 6 \u00b1 3% of SVZ cells , this population is likely to be heterogeneous , consistent with its heterogeneous GFAP expression ( Figure 4A ) . Thus , the actual frequency of qNSCs in the SVZ may be lower than 6% . The current lack of a clonal assay for qNSCs makes it impossible to test the purity of this population . In an effort to identify culture conditions permissive for colony formation by pre-GEPCOT cells we screened 36 different growth factors or medium supplements but none significantly increased colony formation by SVZ cells from normal or TMZ-treated mice ( Supplementary file 1B ) . Thus , future studies will be required to develop culture conditions that permit efficient colony formation by individual qNSCs and to isolate these cells at high purity . An interesting question for future studies will be whether there are regional differences in the distributions or properties of pre-GEPCOT qNSCs or GEPCOT NICs within the SVZ , corresponding to regional differences in stem/progenitor cell properties ( Merkle et al . , 2007 , 2014; Ihrie et al . , 2011 ) . Germline deficiency for the polycomb family member Bmi-1 eliminates multipotent NICs and reduces proliferation and neurogenesis in the SVZ ( Molofsky et al . , 2003; Bruggeman et al . , 2005; Molofsky et al . , 2005; Zencak et al . , 2005; Bruggeman et al . , 2007; Fasano et al . , 2009 ) . However , the lack of a floxed allele of Bmi-1 , the death of germline Bmi-1-deficient mice before adulthood , and the lack of prospective markers for NSCs made it impossible to directly test whether Bmi-1 was required for the maintenance of adult NSCs in vivo . Conditional deletion of Bmi-1 from the fetal and adult SVZ using Nestin-Cre ( Figure 6 ) and Nestin-CreERT2 ( Figure 7 ) demonstrated that pre-GEPCOT qNSCs and GEPCOT NICs require Bmi-1 to be maintained in normal numbers in the adult forebrain , but the depletion of these cells and the loss of neurogenesis occurred much more gradually than expected . Even when Bmi-1 was completely deleted in neural stem/progenitor cells during fetal development , normal or near-normal numbers of pre-GEPCOT cells , GEPCOT cells , and SVZ neuroblasts were found in the SVZ of 4 month old Nestin-Cre; Bmi-1fl/fl mice ( Figure 6L\u2013N ) . This demonstrates that pre-GEPCOT qNSCs and GEPCOT NICs can persist throughout fetal and postnatal development , and into adulthood , in the absence of Bmi-1 . This suggests that qNSCs and NICs are less acutely dependent upon Bmi-1 for their maintenance than expected based on studies of Bmi-1 germline knockout mice ( van der Lugt et al . , 1994; Molofsky et al . , 2003; Bruggeman et al . , 2005; Molofsky et al . , 2005; Fasano et al . , 2009 ) . There are likely several reasons why Bmi-1 germline knockout mice appeared to exhibit a more severe loss of neural stem/progenitor cells and neurogenesis than is evident in conditional knockout mice . First , the phenotype in Bmi-1 germline knockout mice may indeed be more severe as non-cell-autonomous effects of Bmi-1 deficient stroma contribute to stem cell deficits in these mice ( Oguro et al . , 2006 , 2010 ) . Second , the death of Bmi-1 germline knockout mice before young adulthood meant that adult phenotypes could not be studied directly and it was assumed that the deficits observed in the early postnatal period would rapidly worsen over time . Third , without the ability to prospectively identify qNSCs or NICs in vivo , these cells could only be studied based on neurosphere formation in culture . Since p16Ink4a and p19Arf expression are induced to a greater extent in culture than in vivo , the severity of Bmi-1 deficiency phenotypes in the nervous system are sometimes exaggerated in culture ( Molofsky et al . , 2005; He et al . , 2009 ) . Our data indicate that Bmi-1 is not required for the persistence of NSCs or neurogenesis into adulthood , though both are depleted over time during adulthood after Bmi-1 deletion . Consistent with the gradual depletion of pre-GEPCOT cells , GEPCOT cells , and neurogenesis during adulthood after conditional Bmi-1 deletion , we also observed a gradual increase in Cdkn2a ( p16Ink4a ) expression in pre-GEPCOT cells but not in GEPCOT cells ( Figures 6O and 7R , Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2H ) . This suggests that qNSCs are particularly dependent upon Bmi-1 for the repression of Cdkn2a ( p16Ink4a ) expression . The identification of markers that prospectively identify and isolate distinct populations of qNSCs and NICs will make it possible to characterize their properties in vivo rather than relying upon colony-forming assays in culture . Use of commercially available antibodies against cell surface antigens will enable such studies in a wide range of genetic backgrounds . Our data on Bmi-1 demonstrate how the existence of these markers makes it possible to assess the function of gene products within the neural stem/progenitor cell pool with a more granular appreciation for effects on qNSCs vs NICs . \n C57Bl/6 were maintained in standard cages with water and standard diet ( Teklad 2916 ) ad libitum . Rosa26CAG-loxp-Stop-loxp-tdTomato ( Ai14 ) ( referred to here as Rosa26-loxp-tdTomato ) ( Madisen et al . , 2010 ) , Gli1CreERT2 ( Ahn and Joyner , 2005 ) , Sox2CreERT2 ( Arnold et al . , 2011 ) , Dlx1CreERT2 ( Taniguchi et al . , 2011 ) , Tg ( Slc1a3-CreERT ) ( Wang et al . , 2012 ) , Tg ( Nestin-Cre ) ( Tronche et al . , 1999 ) and Tg ( Ubc-GFP ) ( Schaefer et al . , 2001 ) mice were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory ( Bar Harbor , ME ) . Tg ( GFAP-CreERT2 ) ( Hirrlinger et al . , 2006 ) mice were provided by Frank Kirchhoff . Tg ( Nestin-GFP ) ( Birbrair et al . , 2011 ) and Tg ( Nestin-mCherry ) ( Ding et al . , 2012 ) mice were kindly provided by Grigori Enikopalov . Tg ( Nestin-CreERT2 ) mice were provided by G Fishell ( Balordi and Fishell , 2007 ) . Ascl1CreERT2 ( Kim et al . , 2011 ) mice were housed in the Johnson laboratory . All mice were backcrossed onto a C57BL/Ka background for at least three generations prior to analysis . For BrdU pulses up to 24 hr , 100 mg of BrdU/kg body mass dissolved in PBS was injected i . p . every 6 hours . For 2-week pulses of BrdU , mice were initially injected with 100 mg of BrdU/kg body mass then maintained on drinking water that contained 1 mg/ml BrdU until sacrifice . Targeting vectors to generate Bmi1fl mice ( Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A ) were constructed by recombineering ( Liu et al . , 2003 ) . W4 ES cells were electroporated with the targeting vector and positive clones identified by southern blotting were injected into blastocysts from C57BL/6-Tyrc-2J mice . The resulting male chimeric mice were bred to female C57BL/6-Tyrc-2J mice to obtain germline transmission . The FRT-Neo-FRT cassette was removed by crossing with Flp deleter mice ( Rodriguez et al . , 2000 ) , and then Bmi1fl mice were backcrossed onto a C57BL/Ka background for at least 10 generations . Animal protocols were approved by the University of Michigan Committee on the Use and Care of Animals and the UT Southwestern Medical Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee ( protocol# 2011-0104 ) . Tamoxifen ( T5648; Sigma , St . Louis , MO ) was dissolved in 90% corn oil/10% ethanol at 20 mg/ml , and injected at 80 mg/kg/day i . p . for 5 consecutive days into 8\u201312 week-old mice , then the mice were chased for 2 , 7 , 28 , or 60 days until analysis . For Bmi-1 experiments , tamoxifen citrate ( Sigma or Spectrum Chemical , New Brunswick , NJ ) was given in chow at 400 mg/kg with 5% sucrose ( Harlan ) to 6 week-old mice for 30 days . Mice were then fed a standard diet for at least 14 days before analysis . TMZ ( T2577; Sigma ) was dissolved in 25% DMSO/75% 0 . 9% saline solution at 10 mg/ml by heating briefly to 90\u2013100\u00b0C , then shaking and rapidly cooling . Mice were injected at 100 mg/kg/day for 3 consecutive days then allowed to recover for 3\u201390 days before analysis . Mice with enlarged spleen or thymus ( sometimes present at 90 days after TMZ treatment ) were excluded from analysis . SVZs from adult ( 8\u201360 week old ) mice were dissected as described ( Mirzadeh et al . , 2010 ) . SVZs were minced and digested with 300 \u00b5l of trypsin solution ( Ca and Mg-free HBSS , 10 mM HEPES , 0 . 5 mM EDTA , 0 . 25 mg/ml trypsin ( EMD Millipore , Billerica , MA ) , 10 \u03bcg/ml DNase I ( Roche , Basel , Switzerland ) , pH 7 . 6 ) at 37\u00b0C for 20 min . Digestion was quenched with three volumes of staining medium ( 440 ml Leibovitz L-15 medium , 50 ml water , 5 ml 1M HEPES pH 7 . 3\u20137 . 4 , 5 ml 100x Pen-Strep , 20 ml 77 . 7 mM EDTA pH 8 . 0 [prepared from Na2H2EDTA] , 1 g bovine serum albumin [A7030; Sigma] ) containing 100 \u03bcg/ml trypsin inhibitor ( T6522; Sigma ) and 10 \u03bcg/ml DNase I ( Roche ) . Digested SVZ pieces were centrifuged ( 220\u00d7g , 4 min , 4\u00b0C ) then fresh staining medium was added and the pieces were triturated in 300 \u03bcl by gently drawing into a P1000 pipetman and expelling 25 times without forming bubbles . The cell suspension was then filtered through a 45-micron mesh , counted on a hemocytometer , and added to culture or processed for flow cytometry . Neurosphere formation , self-renewal , and differentiation assays were performed as described previously ( Molofsky et al . , 2003; Nishino et al . , 2008 ) , except that in some cases 10 \u03bcM Y-27632 hydrochloride ( Rho-associated protein kinase inhibitor; Tocris Biosciences 1254 , Bristol , UK ) and 20 ng/ml IGF-1 ( 291-G1; R&D Systems , Minneapolis , MN ) were also added to the culture medium because they were found to promote clonogenesis after sorting adult SVZ cells ( data not shown ) . For adherent colony formation , Tg ( Ubc-GFP ) SVZ cells were co-cultured with \u223c80\u201390% confluent nontransgenic neonatal SVZ-derived astrocytes isolated and passaged twice prior to the experiment . GFP fluorescence was used to assess colony formation after 12\u201320 days in culture . For screening for markers of NICs , typically SVZs from 5\u201310 mice were pooled and stained with antibodies then analyzed using a 4 laser FACSAria III ( Becton Dickenson , Franklin Lakes , NJ ) . Markers that stained SVZ cells heterogeneously were used to separate SVZ cells by flow cytometry into different fractions then sorted into non-adherent cultures to measure the frequency of NICs . To stain SVZ cells with the combination of markers used to isolate GEPCOT or pre-GEPCOT cells , dissociated SVZ cells were centrifuged ( 220\u00d7g , 4 min , 4\u00b0C ) and resuspended in 100 \u03bcl staining medium per brain . Then the following antibodies were added: BV421 anti-Ter119 ( 116233; 1/100; Biolegend , San Diego , CA ) , BV421 anti-CD45 ( 103133; 1/100; Biolegend ) , APC-eFluor 780 anti-CD24 ( 47-0242-82; 1/200; eBioscience , San Diego , CA ) , 5A5 ascites ( anti-PSA-NCAM; Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank , Iowa City , IA , 1/100 ) , O4 ascites ( 1/200 ) , anti-PlexinB2 ( 14-5665-82; 1/100; eBioscience ) , biotinylated anti-EGFR ( BAF1280 , 1/200; R&D Systems ) , anti-Glast ( 130-095-822; 1/10; Miltenyi Biotec , Bergisch Gladbach , Germany ) , and DAPI ( 50 \u03bcg/ml , 1/100 ) . After adding antibodies , the cells were incubated on ice for 45 min , then washed with 2 . 5 ml fresh staining medium and pelleted ( 220g for 4 min at 4\u00b0C ) and resuspended in secondary antibodies . Typically we used the following combination: APC anti-mouse IgG2a ( 115-135-206; 1/200; Jackson Immunoresearch , West Grove , PA ) , PE anti-hamster IgG ( 127-115-160; 1/200; Jackson Immunoresearch ) , PE-Cy7 anti-mouse IgM ( 25-5790-82; 1/100; eBioscience ) , BV605-Streptavidin ( 563260; 1/200; BD Biosciences ) . However when analyzing mice expressing tdTomato we used the following alternative secondary antibodies: PerCP-eFluor 710 anti-mouse IgG ( 46-4010-82; 1/100; eBioscience ) , APC anti-hamster IgG ( 127-135-160; 1/200; Jackson Immunoresearch ) , PE-Cy7 anti-mouse IgM ( 25-5790-82; 1/100; eBioscience ) , BV605-Streptavidin ( 563260; 1/200; BD Biosciences ) . Cells were stained with secondary antibodies on ice for 45 min , then washed and pelleted as above , and analyzed on the FACSAria in a volume of 200 \u03bcl per brain . When sorting cells onto slides , a drop of 8 \u03bcl staining medium was placed on a SuperFrost Plus slide , and 100\u2013300 cells were sorted directly into the drop . The slide was then kept humid for 45\u201360 min at ambient temperature to allow the cells to attach to the glass , then the cells were fixed with 4% PFA ( 20 min , RT ) . Cells were then permeabilized and stained with rat anti-BrdU ( Abcam , Cambridge , MA , clone Bu1/75 , 1/500 , after heat-mediated antigen retrieval ) , mouse anti-Nestin ( BD clone Rat-401 , 1/100 after heat-mediated antigen retrieval ) , and rabbit anti-GFAP ( Dako , Carpinteria , CA , 1/3000 ) antibodies using standard techniques . Brains were fixed overnight at 4\u00b0C in 4% PFA in PBS , then cryoprotected in 30% sucrose in PBS for 1\u20133 days at 4\u00b0C , then frozen in OCT or cryogel on dry ice after 3\u201312 hr equilibration at 4\u00b0C . Sections were cut at 12 \u03bcm thickness spanning the rostral half of the SVZ ( typically 6 sections per slide ) or the entire olfactory bulb ( typically 8 sections per slide ) . Sections were immunostained with the following primary antibodies: rat anti-BrdU ( Abcam clone Bu1/75 , 1/500 , after heat-mediated antigen retrieval ) , guinea pig anti-Dcx ( 1/1000; Millipore ) , mouse anti-Mcm2 ( BD Biosciences , 1/500 , after heat-mediated antigen retrieval ) , rat anti-Ki67 ( 1/500; eBioscience ) , mouse anti-tyrosine hydroxylase ( 1/1000; Millipore ) , rabbit anti-calretinin ( 1/1000; Sigma ) , rabbit anti-calbindin ( 1/500; Millipore ) , rabbit anti-S100\u03b2 ( 1/1000; Dako ) , rabbit anti-GST-pi ( 1/3000; Enzo , Farmingdale , NY ) , and mouse anti-NeuN ( 1/1000; Millipore ) . Fixed whole-mount SVZs were stained with mouse anti-acetylated tubulin ( 1/1000; Sigma ) , rabbit anti-\u03b2-catenin ( 1/500; Sigma ) , mouse anti-GFAP ( 1/3000; Sigma ) , and goat anti-EGFR ( 1/250; R&D Systems ) . Alexa Fluor 488- , 555- , and 647-conjugated secondary antibodies were used ( Life Technologies , Carlsbad , CA ) . Cells were resuspended in 10% trichloracetic acid ( TCA , Sigma ) . Extracts were incubated on ice for at least 15 min and centrifuged at 16 , 100\u00d7g at 4\u00b0C for 15 min . Precipitates were washed in acetone twice and dried . The pellets were solubilized in 9M urea , 2% Triton X-100 , and 1% DTT . LDS loading buffer ( Invitrogen ) was added and the pellet was heated at 70\u00b0C for 10 min . Samples were separated on Bis-Trispolyacrylamide gels ( Invitrogen ) and transferred to PVDF membrane ( Millipore or BioRad , Hercules , CA ) . Membranes were treated with the SuperSignal Western Blot Enhancer ( Thermo Scientific , Waltham , MA ) and blots were developed with the SuperSignal West Femto chemiluminescence kit ( Thermo Scientific ) . Blots were stripped with 1% SDS , 25 mM glycine ( pH 2 ) prior to reprobing . The following primary antibodies were used for western blots: \u03b2-Actin ( AC-15; Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Santa Cruz , CA ) , Bmi-1 ( F6; Millipore ) . Cells were sorted directly into RLT plus buffer ( Qiagen , Venlo , Netherlands ) supplemented with 2-mercaptoethanol . RNA was extracted with the RNeasy micro plus kit ( Qiagen ) and cDNA was synthesized with the RT2 First Strand Kit ( Qiagen ) . Reactions were run in 20 \u03bcl volumes with SYBR green and a LightCycler 480 ( Roche Applied Science ) .

Neurosphere assays were done as previously published by our lab ( Molofsky et al . , 2003 , 2005; Nishino et al . , 2008 ) .

{"lay_summary": "Cells can sense a range of mechanical forces both inside and outside the body , such as the stroke of a fingertip or the filling of a lung . Pores on the surface of the cell called Piezo channels open up in response to this pressure . This allows ions to flood in to the cell and trigger a series of biochemical reactions that alter the cell\u2019s behavior . Piezo channels have a unique bowl-like structure that transforms the shape of the cell surface around them , potentially affecting how nearby proteins behave . Previous research had suggested that these channels might be unevenly distributed across the cell surface , and were predicted to modify each other\u2019s behaviors when tightly packed together . This cooperative response would have a significant impact on how cells sense mechanical force . To investigate if this was the case , Lewis and Grandl studied a mouse cell called Neuro2A which naturally produces Piezo ion channels . In the experiment , pressure was applied to different parts of the cell and the electric current generated by ions moving across the surface was recorded: the higher the electrical activity , the more ion channels present . This showed that Piezo channels are randomly distributed across the cell surface and do not tend to cluster together . The same Neuro2A cells were then engineered to produce up to one hundred times more Piezo proteins . Despite the channels being more densely packed together , how they responded to mechanical force remained the same . These results suggest that Piezo channels act independently and are not influenced by close proximity to one another . Lewis and Grandl propose that this property may ensure that all parts of the cell surface react to mechanical force in the same way . Further work is needed to see if this finding applies to other cell types that produce Piezo proteins .", "article": "Piezo1 is a mechanically activated ion channel involved in sensing forces in various cell types and tissues . Cryo-electron microscopy has revealed that the Piezo1 structure is bowl-shaped and capable of inducing membrane curvature via its extended footprint , which indirectly suggests that Piezo1 ion channels may bias each other\u2019s spatial distribution and interact functionally . Here , we use cell-attached patch-clamp electrophysiology and pressure-clamp stimulation to functionally examine large numbers of membrane patches from cells expressing Piezo1 endogenously at low levels and cells overexpressing Piezo1 at high levels . Our data , together with stochastic simulations of Piezo1 spatial distributions , show that both at endogenous densities ( 1\u20132 channels/\u03bcm2 ) , and at non-physiological densities ( 10\u2013100 channels/\u03bcm2 ) predicted to cause substantial footprint overlap , Piezo1 density has no effect on its pressure sensitivity or open probability in the nominal absence of membrane tension . The results suggest that Piezo channels , at densities likely to be physiologically relevant , inherently behave as independent mechanotransducers . We propose that this property is essential for cells to transduce forces homogeneously across the entire cell membrane . \n Cells are constantly exposed to mechanical forces and have evolved diverse molecular mechanisms that enable force detection . The rapid sensing of mechanical forces that occurs in milliseconds is achieved by force-gated ion channels that convert mechanical energy into electrochemical signals ( Kefauver et al . , 2020 ) . For example , Piezo1 is a mechanically gated cation channel that directly senses membrane tension ( T ) with high sensitivity ( Coste et al . , 2010; Cox et al . , 2016; Lewis and Grandl , 2015; Syeda et al . , 2016 ) . Therefore , theoretically , any mechanical disturbance of the cell membrane may lead to changes in Piezo1 channel open probability ( Po ) . However , the propagation of membrane tension away from its source has been shown to be relatively slow ( D ~ 0 . 024 \u00b5m2/s ) , poising Piezo channels with the ability to efficiently and rapidly transduce only mechanical forces that are nearby ( Shi et al . , 2018 ) . The degree to which forces are transduced homogeneously across the cell membrane likely depends not only on the dynamics of membrane tension propagation , but also on ( i ) the spatial distribution of force-gated ion channels , and ( ii ) on their functional independence . Any substantial deviation from a uniform distribution of force-gated ion channels will result in domains that fail to detect forces ( where there are no ion channels ) as well as domains that transduce forces disproportionately ( where many ion channels are nearby ) . Functional interactions and/or cooperativity between force-gated ion channels may further skew transduction efficiency or kinetics in a manner that depends on local channel density , effectively creating a patchwork of blind spots and sensitized areas . Indeed , there is recent experimental evidence suggesting that Piezo1 channels may be non-uniformly distributed . TIRF imaging of Piezo1 channels revealed their free diffusion over the surface of live neural stem/progenitor cells , indirectly suggesting channels are not tethered to other static structures and that random membrane distribution may be possible . However , in the same cells , Piezo1-related activity was spatially enriched , which could arise from non-uniform distribution of Piezo1 channels , variable membrane tension , or both ( Ellefsen et al . , 2019 ) . STORM imaging of HEK293 cells stably expressing GFP-tagged Piezo1 also suggested a non-homogenous spatial distribution , but at channel densities that are likely not physiological ( Ridone et al . , 2020 ) . Additional studies have proposed the existence of clusters with varying numbers of channels ( Jiang et al . , 2021 ) , and that Piezo1 may be concentrated at focal adhesions ( Mingxi Yao et al . , 2020 ) and at wound edges in keratinocytes ( Holt et al . , 2021 ) . A compelling theoretical framework predicting spatial and functional interactions between nearby Piezo channels has been constructed based on cryo-electron microscopy structures of Piezo1 , which revealed its large and extremely curved dome-shaped structure ( Guo and MacKinnon , 2017; Haselwandter and MacKinnon , 2018; Saotome et al . , 2018 ) . Theoretical calculations based on these structures suggest that Piezo1 can both sense and curve the proximal membrane with a characteristic decay length extending ~14 nm beyond the channel . The energetic cost of this membrane curvature implies that Piezo1 channels that are within ~3 decay lengths ( a \u2018footprint\u2019 of ~50 nm; see Materials and methods ) may influence each other via multiple mechanisms: opposing curvature may cause nearby Piezo1 channels to repel each other , as well as influence each other\u2019s gating properties ( Haselwandter and MacKinnon , 2018 ) . Indeed , imaging of vesicles containing reconstituted Piezo1 has demonstrated the ability of Piezo1 to curve the membrane locally and suggested that flattening of the channel dome may directly couple to channel opening , but the precise effects of membrane energetics on gating have yet to be explored experimentally ( Jiang et al . , 2021; Lin et al . , 2019 ) . Here , we set out to quantify the spatial distribution and potential functional interactions of Piezo1 ion channels across multiple orders of channel densities . Specifically , we use electrophysiology and large numbers of independent measurements to simultaneously quantify channel number and function , including single-channel current , open probability , and pressure sensitivity . Collectively , our electrophysiological data , together with stochastic simulations show that Piezo1 ion channels , at densities likely to be physiologically relevant , inherently function as independent mechanotransducers . We propose that this property enables cells to transduce forces with high spatial homogeneity across the entire cell membrane . \n To simultaneously measure and thus directly correlate Piezo1 channel density with its gating properties , we performed cell-attached patch-clamp electrophysiology on Neuro2A cells , which natively express Piezo1 ( Coste et al . , 2010 ) . We chose Neuro2A cells over human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVECs; Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1 ) and other cell lines because they have among the highest endogenous levels of Piezo1 expression , thus offering the highest likelihood for observing any potential functional effects of local channel density on function . We then designed a novel stimulation protocol that we optimized to assess Piezo1 single-channel conductance ( i ) , pressure sensitivity ( P50 ) , and number of channels ( n ) in each patch with high accuracy . Since Piezo1 inactivation precludes a precise measurement of maximal current ( Imax ) at negative potentials , we recorded currents at +60 mV , where inactivation during short pressure steps is minimal ( Coste et al . , 2010; Wu et al . , 2017 ) . However , traditional step protocols are well known to induce irreversible changes in patch geometry owing to membrane creep , particularly at positive voltages ( Lewis and Grandl , 2015; Suchyna et al . , 2009 ) . Indeed , a direct step to a saturating pressure ( \u201360 mmHg ) caused small , but measurable changes in current due to leak and/or capacitance even in patches that were later classified to have zero channels ( see below; mean \u00b1 SD: 2 . 6 \u00b1 1 . 3 pA; n=33 patches; Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A-B ) . Consistent with this idea , the same pressure step caused a similarly small current in patches from Neuro2A-Piezo1ko cells , which have been CRISPR-engineered to lack Piezo1 channels ( mean \u00b1 SD: 3 . 8 \u00b1 1 . 5 pA , n=15 patches; Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2C ) . Consequently , a step protocol consistently overestimates current by 2\u20133 pA , and thus channel numbers accordingly ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2B ) . To overcome this limitation , we instead designed a protocol in which the pressure was decreased incrementally in 1 mmHg steps from 0 mmHg to \u201360 mmHg in 50 ms intervals , thus approximating a ramp ( Figure 1A\u2013D , top ) . The total duration of this ramp is short enough to minimize membrane creep ( 3 s ) , but each step is long enough ( 50 ms ) to allow pressure equilibration , which occurs within ~7 ms ( Lewis et al . , 2017 ) . Similar to the step protocol , the ramp protocol elicited small background changes in current amplitude in all patches . However , instead of the square-like current increases evoked by the step protocol , here the current changed more steadily , allowing us to perform linear background subtractions for each individual patch ( Figure 1A\u2013D , middle ) and ultimately achieve a more reliable detection of channel gating events , which were easily discerned as nearly instantaneous changes in current amplitude ( Figure 1A\u2013D , top , arrows ) . We are confident that these slow changes in current are unrelated to Piezo gating , as currents clearly saturated after leak subtraction ( Figure 1A\u2013D , bottom ) . Additionally , we never observed channel openings during the ramp phase of the protocol in 15 patches from Neuro2A-Piezo1ko cells ( data not shown ) . Ultimately , we decided to combine the ramp stimulus protocol with a subsequent brief ( 200 ms ) saturating pressure step to \u201360 mmHg . Importantly , the step pulse allowed us to confirm post hoc that inactivation of Piezo1 at this voltage is minimal ( step pulse: mean current at 200 ms = 96 . 5\u00b17 . 4% of peak; n=281 patches; Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A , D ) . Next , we focused on titrating the sizes of our patch pipettes such that a substantial fraction of patches had zero channels ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2E; see Materials and methods for details ) . We limited our pipettes to 3\u20136 . 5 M\u03a9 , reasoning that this choice maximizes our ability to detect potential channel clusters and thus resolve the overall spatial distribution of channels . Also , to address the possibility that Piezo1 cellular distribution could be altered by the cell-substrate interface , which we reasoned may trap Piezo1 channels and deplete them from cell-attached patch-recordings on the cell roof , we performed day-matched experiments of Neuro2A cells that had either been seeded to adhere overnight or were acutely replated <1 hr before recording , therefore allowing limited time for channel redistribution ( see Materials and methods ) . Importantly , we found that the mean channel number and distributions in these two data sets were identical ( mean \u00b1 SEM: overnight=2 . 4\u00b10 . 4 channels , n=28 patches; acute=2 . 7\u00b10 . 4 channels , n=26 patches , p=0 . 6 , Student\u2019s t-test; Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2F ) , which argues against an effect of channel redistribution to the cell-substrate interface . Finally , in order to obtain good representations of the spatial distribution and function of Piezo1 channels , we executed this protocol on patches from a very large number of individual Neuro2A cells ( n=281 ) . After linear leak subtraction , we could easily recognize in most patches ( 248/281 ) discrete , nearly instantaneous increases in current amplitude that are reflective of individual channel openings , as well as clearly identify a plateau phase of the current ( Figure 1B , middle ) . The remaining patches ( 33/281 ) were classified as having zero channels ( e . g . , Figure 1A ) . We next used the mean single-channel current from all patches with one channel ( i=0 . 98\u00b10 . 04 pA , n=35 patches; Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2G ) to calculate the precise number of channels ( n=Imax/i ) in all other patches . Ultimately , we obtained a continuous , bell-shaped distribution of Piezo1 channel numbers per patch ( Figure 1E ) . The distribution average was 3 . 5\u00b13 . 1 channels per patch , which given our small pipette sizes is consistent with previously reported levels of expression in Neuro2A cells ( Coste et al . , 2010 ) . We also applied each protocol twice per patch and then performed pairwise comparison of current amplitudes ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2H-I ) . This analysis revealed an extremely low variability ( ratio of 2nd/1st recording=1 . 1\u00b10 . 4; n=261 ) , supporting that the assessment of channel numbers is highly accurate . We estimated the dome size of membrane patches inside patch pipettes from imaging experiments to be 2 \u00b5m ( see Materials and methods ) and used this value to calculate the average density of Piezo1 channels to be 1\u20132 channels/\u00b5m2 . Next , we used two different approaches to assess if the density of Piezo1 channels affects their sensitivity to membrane tension: First , we calculated P50 values , measured from sigmoidal fits to the ramp phase of the current , and plotted them as a function of channel number ( Figure 1F ) . Although P50 measurements varied widely in individual patches , especially for those with <5 channels , because of the stochastic nature of channel gating ( e . g . , Figure 1C ) , this variance is partially overcome by the large number of measurements we obtained ( n=248 ) . Importantly , while there was some variability between two protocols executed on the same patch , there was only a slight systematic shift in P50 values toward smaller pressures in the second protocol , likely due to creep and corresponding increase in patch radius ( mean \u00b1 SD first=\u201333 . 1\u00b17 . 2 mmHg , second=\u201331 . 1\u00b17 . 7 mmHg; \u0394P50=+2 . 0\u00b18 . 2 mmHg; p<0 . 05 , paired t-test; Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2J ) , providing further evidence that our protocol allowed for highly reproducible measurements . Altogether , the results show that , for patches containing 1\u201314 channels , average P50 values do not vary substantially with channel number ( Figure 1F ) . Still , to measure P50 values in patches with few channels more precisely , we also performed a different analysis: Specifically , we idealized recordings with \u22665 channels by identifying discrete openings ( Figure 2A\u2013E; see Materials and methods ) and then averaged all idealized traces with equal channel numbers in order to obtain mean pressure-response curves ( Figure 2B ) . Visual inspection as well as fits with sigmoidal functions show that P50 and slope ( k ) values are virtually identical for patches containing 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , or 5 channels ( 1 channel: P50=\u201323 . 2 mmHg , k=\u20133 . 3 mmHg; 5 channels: P50=\u201323 . 7 mmHg , k=\u20134 . 2 mmHg ) . We therefore conclude from both analyses that at densities of up to 2 channels/\u00b5m2 , Piezo1 channels do not influence each other\u2019s mechanosensitivity . Multiple mechanisms may explain our above result that Piezo1 pressure sensitivity does not vary with channel density . First , Piezo1 channels may be randomly distributed and therefore spatially too distant to functionally interact via their membrane footprints . Alternatively , Piezo1 channels may indeed tend to localize in close spatial proximity ( i . e . , groups of 2\u20133 channels ) , but this localization may have no effect on their pressure sensitivity . To begin distinguishing among these possibilities , we built a statistical model for spatial localization , based on a Thomas point process ( see Materials and methods for details ) . First , we simulated a distribution of randomly dispersed Piezo1 channels . Then we randomly sampled from this population , accounting for variability of pipette sizes and single-channel currents by using our experimental mean values and standard deviations of pipette size and single-channel conductance ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2E , G ) . The resulting distribution fits the experimental data reasonably well , indicating that in Neuro2A cells , Piezo1 channels may be homogenously distributed across the cell surface , rather than being spatially localized in close proximity ( Figure 3A\u2013F ) . In order to challenge this interpretation , we next simulated a random distribution of Piezo1 clusters in which individual Piezo channels are distributed across a 2D-Gaussian distribution with a standard deviation of 50 nm , which is the estimated size of the Piezo channel footprint ( Haselwandter and MacKinnon , 2018; see Materials and methods ) , all while holding the overall channel density constant . Strikingly , a distribution in which on average 1 . 6 Piezo1 channels ( drawn from a Poisson distribution centered at 1; see Materials and methods ) interact over 50 nm also describes the experimental data well . However , simulating larger channel clusters ( n ~ 5 ) fails to reproduce the experimental distribution , specifically the probability of capturing patches without any channels ( Figure 3A\u2013F ) . Thus , our experimental data are most parsimoniously explained by either a random spatial distribution or a weak propensity for Piezo channels to spatially localize in groups of 2\u20133 . Interestingly , the two distributions differ significantly in the predicted fraction of channels that are within one footprint of at least one other channel: in a truly random distribution , the mean nearest-neighbor distance is ~390 nm , and only ~5% of channels are within 100 nm of another channel , whereas if channels tend to cluster in groups of 2\u20133 , the mean nearest-neighbor distance is reduced to 225 nm and almost 50% of channels are within 100 nm of another channel ( Figure 3G\u2013H ) . However , our functional data support the idea that if the latter spatial localization indeed occurs , it does not have a substantial effect on Piezo1 pressure sensitivity ( Figures 1 and 2 ) . Our above results do not answer if , in principle , Piezo1 channels have the ability to functionally interact . We therefore decided next to examine Piezo1 function using a heterologous overexpression system , in which channel densities are much higher . For these experiments , we chose Neuro2A-Piezo1ko cells , in order to retain the same cellular background , but avoid heterogeneity from endogenous and overexpressed Piezo1 , especially given that there are known splice variants of Piezo1 ( Geng et al . , 2020 ) . In pilot experiments , we found that transfection with Lipofectamine 2000 maximizes channel density 42\u201348 hr post-transfection ( data not shown ) . We first repeated our previous ramp protocol , but found that while overexpression yields peak currents that are much larger , these currents inactivate to a larger extent even at +60 mV , such that a ramp protocol substantially underestimates the total number of channels in the patch ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1; current at 200 ms=53 . 3\u00b118 . 1% of peak , n=138 patches ) . Therefore , we instead chose to use a classic pressure-step protocol to best measure both peak current ( Imax ) and pressure sensitivity ( P50 and k ) ( Figure 4A\u2013B ) . While the step protocol still produces a 2\u20133 pA background current at high pressures , owing to changes in leak and/or capacitance , here , this error is very minor compared to the large Piezo-mediated currents ( generally 20\u2013200 pA ) , especially for patches with many channels . To reduce bias from resting membrane tension , each pressure step was preceded by a 5 s +5 mmHg prepulse , the first 4 s of which was applied at \u201380 mV to minimize the cumulative effects of positive voltage on membrane creep ( Suchyna et al . , 2009 ) . We used a pressure increment ( \u0394P ) of \u20135 mmHg , so that we could better resolve small changes in pressure sensitivity , but limited the duration of each step to 250 ms to again minimize membrane creep ( Figure 4A and B ) . The low channel activity during the prepulse allowed us to measure the single-channel current of each individual patch at both \u201380and +60 mV ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2B , C ) and therefore to precisely calculate the minimal number of channels ( n=Imax/i ) . This is particularly important in a cell-attached configuration , where even in a high K+ solution , there can be slight variance in the resting membrane potential and correspondingly variance in the single-channel current in each cell that introduces an additional source of error . Importantly , there was no correlation between number of channels and single-channel current , suggesting that unitary conductance of Piezo1 is not modulated by channel density ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2E , F ) . As before , we restricted our pipettes to 3\u20136 . 5 M\u03a9 , a range in which peak current amplitudes do not vary substantially ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3A ) . We again repeated this measurement for many individual patches ( n=144 patches ) in order to capture an accurate representation of channel densities and functional interactions . The number of channels per patch was well described by a Gaussian distribution with 89 . 2\u00b149 . 8 channels per patch ( Figure 4C ) , which we estimate corresponds to a Piezo1 density of ~45 channels/\u00b5m2 ( see Materials and methods ) . The most extreme current amplitude we observed ( \u2013190 pA , or ~200 channels ) corresponds to a maximal density of ~100 channels/\u00b5m2 . At this maximal density , if Piezo channels were randomly distributed in the membrane , their mean next-neighbor distance would be ~50 nm ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 4 ) . This calculation suggests that we have reached densities in which Piezos are likely in close enough proximity to influence each other\u2019s function . Moreover , this calculation likely represents a slight underestimate of the true channel density , as residual inactivation at positive potentials may lead to a population of \u2018silent\u2019 channels that do not manifest themselves functionally . Two groups had previously predicted that nearby Piezo1 channels may influence each other\u2019s gating , even in the absence of membrane tension ( Haselwandter and MacKinnon , 2018; Jiang et al . , 2021 ) . We therefore chose first to analyze the activity during the prepulse , which is designed to minimize resting membrane tension . We found that open probability was generally small ( <1% ) , which was consistent with previous work in our lab ( Wu et al . , 2016 ) . Most notably however , we found that Piezo1 open probability did not increase with channel density; rather , open probability slightly decreased , from 0 . 6\u00b10 . 4% for patches with 1\u201310 channels ( mean \u00b1 SD; n=3 patches ) to 0 . 2\u00b10 . 1% for patches with >200 channels ( n=3 patches ) ( Figure 4D ) . There was no change in open probability with pipette resistance , indicating that variability in the ability of the prepulse to minimize resting tension with pipette size does not account for this trend in open probability with channel number ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3B ) . As an alternative test , we measured the effect of channel number on pressure sensitivity . Both slope and P50 values were unaffected by channel number ( Figure 4E\u2013F ) , and these values were also unaffected by pipette size ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3C-D ) . However , patches with small ensembles of channels ( <20 ) yielded imprecise estimates of P50 and slope values for two reasons: First , for patches with few channels , the stochastic nature of channel gating generates highly variable individual pressure-response curves . Second , the relatively few patches we obtained with low channel numbers resulted in large errors in mean value estimates . Therefore , we also analyzed the data in a separate way: we normalized each patch to its maximal current , binned patches according to their number of channels , and then averaged pressure-response curves ( Figure 4G ) . The results again show that pressure-response curves and sensitivity ( slope ) are independent of channel numbers ( for 0\u201320 channels , P50=\u201321 . 5 mmHg , k=\u20138 . 0 mmHg , n=5; for >200 channels , P50=\u201321 . 0 mmHg , k=\u20136 . 8 mmHg , n=3 ) . Finally , we combined our electrophysiological pressure-step protocol with differential interference contrast ( DIC ) imaging to directly measure the relationship between channel density and membrane tension ( Lewis and Grandl , 2015; Figure 5A\u2013C ) . In these experiments , we were able to independently calculate channel density for each individual patch by dividing the number of channels in each patch by its visualized surface area at 0 mmHg ( see Materials and methods; Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . This more detailed approach also allowed us to rule out that deviations in pipette size create a systematic bias on P50 values , as radius , and therefore tension , is measured for each individual patch and applied pressure . Importantly , we found no correlation between either the tension of half-maximal activation ( T50 ) or the slope ( k ) and channel density in the range of 10\u201370 channels/\u00b5m2 ( Figure 5D\u2013F ) , again supporting that Piezo1 channels do not influence each other\u2019s tension sensitivity . Altogether , we conclude that at low and high densities , Piezo1 channels show no positive cooperativity in the presence or in the nominal absence of membrane tension . \n We sought to characterize the inherent ability of Piezo channels to spatially localize and modulate each other\u2019s function . We chose cell-attached patch-clamp electrophysiology as a method for investigation , which has several inherent limitations that need to be considered . First , our spatial resolution is naturally limited by the size of the patch pipette . Consequently , our statistical approach of counting channels within membrane patches works best when the spatial distance between Piezo1 channels is comparable to the size of the membrane dome inside the patch pipette . The fact that ~15% of patches in wild-type Neuro2A cells contained no Piezo1 channels ( Figure 1E ) is therefore an extremely important quality benchmark for adequate spatial resolution . Our modeling does not allow us to rule out the possibility of moderate clustering ( 2\u20133 Piezo1 channels ) , but we find no evidence for clusters of larger sizes ( ~5 channels ) , which we would have been able to detect ( Figure 3 ) . Next , our measurement of endogenous Piezo1 density in Neuro2A cells ( 1 . 75 channels/\u00b5m2 ) has several sources of error: first , while we have modest control over the pipette shape during its fabrication and a precise measure of its resistance , without simultaneous DIC imaging , the exact surface of each individual membrane dome is not known . In order to minimize this size variability , we therefore limited the majority of our analyses to measurements from a narrow range of pipette resistances and incorporated this size variability of patch pipettes into our statistical model of Piezo1 spatial distribution ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2D ) . Additionally , we performed a smaller subset of experiments combining simultaneous DIC imaging with electrophysiology ( Figure 5 ) . Certainly , when overexpressing Piezo1 the variability in Piezo1 membrane levels is high , in part due to variable expression levels among cells . Assessing Piezo1 expression levels is also subject to error due to the presence of inactivation , which prevents reaching a Po=1 . Specifically , channels inactivating during the rising phase of the current , as well as the presence of \u2018silent\u2019 channels that fail to respond to the stimulus entirely , contribute to this error . However , none of the above statistical errors , or others we did not consider and that skew channel number distributions , affect our ability to correlate Piezo1 channel number with its function . The weaknesses of cell-attached patch-clamp electrophysiology are balanced by two clear strengths: the method has relatively high throughput so that large numbers of independent measurements yield good population averages , and it has unmatched precision: channel density and function , including single-channel current , open probability , and pressure sensitivity can be extracted over 2 orders of magnitude ( 1\u2013100 channels/\u00b5m2 ) with high accuracy . For example , repeated execution of pressure ramps on each patch revealed that channel number ( n ) is measured with only 24% variability , demonstrating that this assessment is extremely accurate . Neither endogenous Piezo1 in Neuro2A cells or overexpression of Piezo1 in Neuro2A-P1ko cells are perfect model systems for investigating how Piezo1 channels function when they are directly contacting each other: experimental channel densities do not reach the theoretical limit of a tightly packed 2D hexagonal lattice . However , the maximal densities we obtained are certainly sufficient for Piezo1 membrane footprints to geometrically overlap: for example , at the highest density we measured ( ~100 channels/\u00b5m2 ) , the centers of randomly spaced Piezo1 domes are on average 50 nm from their nearest-neighbor , which results in a substantial number of channels having overlapping membrane footprints ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 4; Haselwandter and MacKinnon , 2018 ) . In any case , two distinct analyses show that at densities of 1\u20132 channels/\u00b5m2 ( Figures 1\u20132 ) and 10\u2013100 channels/\u00b5m2 ( Figures 4\u20135 ) , Piezo1 pressure and tension sensitivity are not modulated by channel numbers . A mechanistic explanation for this result at low densities is directly provided by our data and statistical model of spatial distributions , which suggest that in Neuro2A cells , Piezo1 channels are either randomly distributed or have at best a very low probability of aggregating . This is consistent with Haselwandter and MacKinnon\u2019s prediction that the Piezo structure favors channels to repel each other . However , the result does not mean that Piezo1 channels in close proximity can never be found . At native expression levels , a mild tendency for clustering predicts 20% of all Piezo1 channels will be within 50 nm of each other ( cluster size=1 . 6; Figure 3G ) , which is fully consistent with studies that have captured images of neighboring Piezo1 channels ( Ridone et al . , 2020 ) , but 80% of all Piezo1 channels are outside this range . In other words , in wild-type Neuro2A cells , most Piezo1 channels are too far apart to \u2018feel\u2019 each other . As a consequence , they behave as functionally independent mechanotransducers . This result is important , because it shows that Piezo1 channels have no strong intrinsic tendency to spatially concentrate and functionally modulate each other\u2019s mechanical sensitivity . Both of these properties are ideal for a cell in order to transduce mechanical forces homogeneously . Still , does the Piezo1 membrane footprint allow for the possibility of cooperativity among nearby channels ? Our experiments at high channel densities ( up to 100 channels/\u00b5m2 ) reveal no change in Piezo1 pressure sensitivity with increasing channel numbers . Surprisingly , our data do suggest that in the nominal absence of membrane tension Piezo1 open probability is slightly ( ~0 . 5% ) reduced with channel number but overall , very low ( <1% ) at all channel densities we probed . This is notable , because the opposite result was recently obtained by simulations of Piezo1 that are in extreme proximity to each other ( 1\u20133 nm dome-dome distance; Jiang et al . , 2021 ) . The reasons for this discrepancy may be technical limitations in the modeling , which was performed with a partial Piezo1 structure , or our own experiments , which cannot generate the extreme channel densities probed in the simulation . Moreover , any cooperativity need not arise via membrane footprint interactions: for example , calcium permeating through Piezo1 may influence the resting open probability of nearby channels . Indeed , calcium-induced cooperativity is a well-known phenomenon in other ion channels , such as TRPA1 ( Wang et al . , 2008 ) . Our experiments cannot directly rule out this explanation . Altogether , our conclusions may be applicable to other cell types that express Piezos at levels similar or lower to that of Neuro2A cells . However , we fully expect that specific cell types may concentrate Piezo channels into locations that are dedicated to detecting forces . For example , it is plausible that in sensory neurons Piezo2 channels may be highly concentrated in free nerve endings as compared to the cell soma . However , our work directly predicts that if such a clustering was indeed observed , it would require a dedicated mechanism that is not Piezo-intrinsic , such as a still elusive tethering molecule . \n Wild-type Neuro2A cells ( ATCC #CCL-131 ) and Neuro2A-p1ko cells ( a gift of Gary Lewin ) were cultured at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 in Minimum Essential Medium ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) supplemented with 0 . 1 mM non-essential amino acids , 1 mM pyruvate , 10% fetal bovine serum ( Clontech ) , 50 U/ml penicillin , and 50 mg/ml streptomycin ( Life Technologies ) . Both cell lines were STR authenticated by ATCC and tested in-house for mycoplasma via PCR ( ATCC #30-1012K ) . HUVECs ( Clonetics CC-2519 , pooled ) were cultured in EGM-1 . For experiments without transfection , cells were directly plated on poly-L-lysine and laminin-coated coverslips 16\u201324 hr before recording . For overexpression experiments , cells were transiently transfected with 4 \u00b5g mouse Piezo1-pIRES-EGFP in pcDNA3 . 1 ( + ) or 4 \u00b5g YFP 40\u201348 hr before recording in six-well plates using Lipofectamine 2000 ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol . Transfected cells were reseeded onto poly-L-lysine and laminin-coated coverslips or glass-bottomed dishes ( for imaging; MatTek Corporation P50G-0-30F ) 16\u201324 hr before recording . Only one patch was made from each cell; in some cases , two protocols were run on each patch ( as noted ) . For acute plating experiments , cells were reseeded onto poly-L-lysine and laminin-coated coverslips , allowed to settle for 45 min , and then recorded for up to one additional hour . Electrophysiological recordings were performed at room temperature using an EPC10 amplifier and Patchmaster software ( HEKA Elektronik , Lambrecht , Germany ) . Data were sampled at 5 kHz ( wild-type Neuro2A ) or 10 kHz ( Neuro2a-p1ko + mPiezo1 ) and filtered at 2 . 9 kHz . The cell-attached bath solution used to zero the membrane potential was ( in mM ) : 140 KCl , 10 HEPES , 1 MgCl2 , 10 glucose , and pH 7 . 3 with KOH . Borosilicate glass pipettes ( 1 . 5 OD , 0 . 85 ID , Sutter Instrument Company , Novato , CA ) were filled with pipette buffer solution ( in mM ) : 130 NaCl , 5 KCl , 10 HEPES , 10 TEACl , 1 CaCl2 , 1 MgCl2 , and pH 7 . 3 with NaOH . In a small dataset obtained with pipettes with a resistance of less than 3 M\u03a9 , peak current was strongly correlated with pipette size and few patches had zero channels ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2E ) ; we therefore restricted our final data set to pipettes between 3 and 6 . 5 M\u03a9 . Negative pressure was applied through the patch pipette with an amplifier-controlled high-speed pressure clamp system ( HSPC-1; ALA Scientific Instruments , Farmingdale , NY ) . All pressure protocols were preceded by a +5 mmHg prepulse ( ramp protocol , 2 s at +60 mV; step protocol , 4 s at \u201380 mV , and 1 s at +60 mV ) to remove resting tension due to the gigaseal ( Lewis and Grandl , 2015 ) . Imaging was performed as described ( Lewis and Grandl , 2015 ) . Briefly , images were captured at a rate of ~13 frames/s at a resolution of 61 . 5 pixels/\u00b5m using a Plan Apo ( 100\u00d7 ) DIC oil objective coupled with a Coolsnap ES camera and 4\u00d7 relay lens ( Nikon Instruments ) . Images were analyzed in Igor Pro 8 . 02 ( WaveMetrics ) using custom scripts available in our Github repository ( github . com/GrandlLab ) . The membrane was identified by performing a line scan parallel to the pipette walls and localizing the minimum pixel intensity over a rolling average of 5\u20139 pixels and fitting the output with a circle to obtain radius ( R ) . Tension ( T ) was then calculated for each pressure step ( p ) using Laplace\u2019s law: T=R*p/2 . The surface area of each patch ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1 ) was calculated from the radius at 0 mmHg by fitting the patch dome as a spherical cap and manually estimating the contact points between the membrane and the pipette walls . All data were analyzed and final plots were generated using Igor Pro 8 . 02 ( WaveMetrics ) . For currents measured during ramp protocols , current was binned for each pressure ( 1 mmHg increments ) and any linear changes in current prior to the first channel opening were manually identified , attributed to capacitive and/or leak changes , and subtracted off prior to further analysis . Current-pressure curves were fit with a Boltzmann functionI=Imin+Imax1+e ( P50\u2212Pk ) where Imax is the maximal current , P is pressure , P50 is the pressure of half-maximal activation , and k is the slope factor . The number of channels in each patch was calculated by dividing Imax by the mean single-channel current from all patches with precisely one channel ( i . e . , Imax during the ramp phase for patches with only one visually identified discrete opening , Figure 1 ) or from single-channel openings during the +60 mV prepulse ( step recordings with overexpressed channels , Figures 4 and 5 ) . In some recordings , no unitary events were observed at +60 mV during the +5 mmHg prepulse , and pressure was manually adjusted in 1 mmHg increments until single-channel openings were elicited . Single-channel currents during the +5 mmHg prepulse were filtered offline ( 1 kHz ) using Fitmaster v2 \u00d7 90 . 2 and baseline-subtracted using QuB online software ( Nicolai and Sachs , 2014 ) . Single-channel amplitudes during the prepulse were measured by generating all-points histograms with binning calculated using the Freedman-Diaconis method and an optimal bin width of 2*IQR ( x ) /N1/3 , where IQR is the interquartile distance , N is the number of observations , and the bins are evenly distributed between the minimum and maximum values . Binned data were then fit with a double-Gaussian equation of the formy=y0+A1*e-x-x1w12+A2*e-x-x2w22 where y0 is the baseline current , A1 and A2 are the peak amplitudes , x1 and x2 are the centers of the fits , and w1 and w2 are their respective widths . The difference between x1 and x2 reflects the difference between the mean current in the open and closed state and was used to calculate single-channel current i . Open probability during the prepulse was calculated as the mean current ( i*n*Po ) divided by the maximum current elicited for that patch at saturating pressures , assumed to be Po=1 ( i*n ) . For currents measured during step protocols , to reduce artifacts from noise , the peak was measured from a 0 . 5 ms rolling average around the true peak and the steady-state current was calculated as the mean current during the last 10 ms of the step . To generate idealized currents ( Figure 2 ) , the number of channels ( n ) in each patch , as well as the time of openings , were manually identified . The open probability at a given time was taken as the fraction of total channels in the patch that were open . Owing to the lack of inactivation of endogenous currents at +60 mV , as well as the continually increasing pressure , channel closings were rare . Patches with larger numbers of channels ( 3\u20135 ) are underrepresented due to the increased difficulty in identifying discrete openings . Data are reported as mean \u00b1 SD unless otherwise indicated . For box and whisker plots , boxes represent median and first and third quartiles . A model for spatial distribution of Piezo1 ion channels was built using a Thomas point process in IGOR Pro 8 . 02 ( WaveMetrics ) using custom scripts available in our Github repository ( https://github . com/GrandlLab/PiezoClusteringModel copy archived at swh:1:rev:c4463867f753c41d4a92ff25a03ceb6131bfbc22 , Baddeley , 2015 , Grandl , 2021 ) . Parent discs were randomly distributed in a 50 \u00b5m \u00d7 50 \u00b5m arena . Each parent disc was then randomly assigned a varying number of daughter points . For a truly random distribution ( mean cluster=1 ) every parent disc was assigned precisely one daughter point . To introduce a slight propensity for channels to cluster , the number of daughter points were drawn from a Poisson distribution centered at 1 , such that the mean cluster size ( for populated clusters ) was 1 . 6 . To introduce a stronger propensity to cluster , the number of daughter points was drawn from a Poisson distribution centered around 5 ( mean cluster=5 ) ; Figure 3A . The densities of parent discs and daughter points were adjusted such that their product , and thus the final number of daughter points in the arena , was equivalent to that of the wild-type Neuro2A data set ( 1 . 75 channels/\u00b5m2 ) . Daughter points were then distributed in each parental disc according to a Gaussian distribution with an average distance of sigma=50 nm from the center of the disc , or roughly the distance of three Piezo footprint decay lengths . The arena was then sampled with 1000 circles whose centers were uniformly distributed within the arena . To replicate variability in pipette size/patch dome size as source of noise , the mean radius of all circles was 0 . 8 \u00b5m ( see below ) with a standard deviation of 0 . 15 \u03bcm , which corresponds to our mean pipette size of 4 . 35 M\u03a9 and standard deviation of 0 . 8 M\u03a9 ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . Finally , the number of daughter points ( channel counts ) within each circle was then counted . To further account for variability in transmembrane potentials as a source of noise , we translated channel counts into current amplitudes using our experimentally obtained normal distribution of single-channel currents , which yielded a mean single-channel current of 0 . 98 pA and standard deviation of 0 . 22 pA ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2G ) . Current amplitudes were then reverted into channel counts and used to generate a channel count histogram . Nearest-neighbor distributions were obtained from the same simulated distributions as above , by calculating a distance matrix between all channel centers and taking the minimal distance for each row . The characteristic decay length ( \u03bb ) of membrane deformation induced by the large curved dome of Piezo1 is estimated to be 14 nm ( Haselwandter and MacKinnon , 2018 ) . We put upper bounds of possible Piezo energetic interactions due to membrane curvature beyond the dome itself as 3\u00d7 this decay length; when adding this to the radius of the channel dome , this yields an approximate total membrane footprint of ( 10 nm +3*14 nm ~ 50 nm ) . From our imaging data ( Figure 5 and Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1 ) , we estimated that patch domes from pipettes 3 to 6 M\u03a9 have an approximate surface area of 2 \u00b5m2 . If the patch dome is approximated as a flat circle , this corresponds to a pipette radius of 0 . 8 \u00b5m , which was used for simulation of Piezo1 spatial distribution in the Thomas point process model . For native expression in Neuro2A cells , our average channel count was 3 . 5 channels , which corresponds to an average density of 1 . 75 channels/\u00b5m2 . For overexpression of Piezo1 in Neuro2A-p1ko cells , our average channel count was ~100 channels , which corresponds to an average density of 50 channels/\u00b5m2 . For the maximal channel number we observed ( ~200 channels ) , with an estimated in-plane area of 400 nm2 ( Wang et al . , 2019 ) , an estimated footprint of 7800 nm2 ( calculated from a footprint of 50 nm; Haselwandter and MacKinnon , 2018 ) and a patch dome surface area of 2 \u00b5m2 , approximately 4% of the membrane surface would be covered by Piezo channels and 78% of the surface covered by Piezos + corresponding footprints if channels were evenly distributed ( with no overlap of footprints ) .", "headings": ["Abstract", "Introduction", "Results", "Discussion", "Materials and methods"], "keywords": ["structural biology and molecular biophysics", "neuroscience"], "id": "elife-70988-v1"}
{"lay_summary": "Many of our decisions are made on the basis of imperfect or \u2018noisy\u2019 information . A longstanding goal in neuroscience is to work out how such noise affects three aspects of decision-making: the accuracy ( or appropriateness ) of a choice , the speed at which the choice is made , and the decision-maker\u2019s confidence that they have chosen correctly . One theory of decision-making is that the brain simultaneously accumulates evidence for each of the options it is considering , until one option exceeds a threshold and is declared the \u2018winner\u2019 . This theory is known as bounded evidence accumulation . It predicts that increasing the noisiness of the available information decreases the accuracy of decisions made in response . Counterintuitively , it also predicts that such an increase in noise speeds up decision-making and increases confidence levels . Zylberberg et al . have now tested these predictions experimentally by getting human volunteers and monkeys to perform a series of trials where they had to decide whether a set of randomly moving dots moved to the left or to the right overall . Using a newly developed method , the noisiness of the dot motion could be changed between trials . The effectiveness of this technique was confirmed by recording the activity of neurons in the region of the monkey brain that processes visual motion information . After each trial , the humans rated their confidence in their decision . By comparison , the monkeys could indicate that they were not confident in a decision by opting for a guaranteed small reward on certain trials ( instead of the larger reward they received when they correctly indicated the direction of motion of the dots ) . In both humans and monkeys , increasing the noisiness associated with the movement of the dots led to faster and more confident decision-making , just as the bounded evidence accumulation framework predicts . Furthermore , the results presented by Zylberberg et al . suggest that the brain does not always gauge how reliable evidence is in order to fine-tune decisions . Now that the role of noise in decision-making is better understood , future experiments could attempt to reveal how artificial manipulations of the brain contribute both information and noise to a decision . Other experiments might ascertain when the brain can learn that noisy information should invite slower , more cautious decisions .", "article": "Many decisions are thought to arise via the accumulation of noisy evidence to a threshold or bound . In perception , the mechanism explains the effect of stimulus strength , characterized by signal-to-noise ratio , on decision speed , accuracy and confidence . It also makes intriguing predictions about the noise itself . An increase in noise should lead to faster decisions , reduced accuracy and , paradoxically , higher confidence . To test these predictions , we introduce a novel sensory manipulation that mimics the addition of unbiased noise to motion-selective regions of visual cortex , which we verified with neuronal recordings from macaque areas MT/MST . For both humans and monkeys , increasing the noise induced faster decisions and greater confidence over a range of stimuli for which accuracy was minimally impaired . The magnitude of the effects was in agreement with predictions of a bounded evidence accumulation model . \n Decisions that combine information from different sources or across time are of special interest to neuroscience because they serve as a model of cognitive function . These decisions are not hard wired or reflexive , yet they are experimentally tractable . Psychologists have long sought to understand how the process of decision formation gives rise to three key observables ( Cartwright and Festinger , 1943; Audley , 1960; Vickers , 1979 ) . First there is the choice itself ( left or right , coffee or tea ) , which determines accuracy in cases where a correct alternative can be defined . Second , there is the time it takes to reach a decision , which determines reaction-time ( RT ) . RT furnishes a powerful constraint on models of decision-making , and is a defining element of the trade-off between speed and accuracy that characterizes most decisions . Third , decisions are often accompanied by a graded degree of belief in the accuracy or appropriateness of the choice . This belief , referred to as decision confidence , influences many aspects of behavior: how we learn from our mistakes , plan subsequent decisions , and communicate our decisions to others . A model of the decision process ought to explain not just choices but all three of these observables in a quantitative fashion . The family of bounded evidence accumulation models , including drift diffusion , race and attractor models , offers one such framework for linking choice , reaction time and confidence [for reviews , see Gold and Shadlen ( 2007 ) ; Shadlen and Kiani ( 2013 ) ] . These models depict the decision process as a race between competing accumulators , each of which integrates momentary evidence for one alternative and against the others . The decision terminates when the accumulated evidence for one alternative , termed a decision variable ( DV ) , reaches a threshold or bound , thereby determining both the choice and the decision time . Confidence in the decision derives from a mapping between the DV and the probability that a decision based on this DV will be correct . The mapping is thought to incorporate the decision time or the state of the competing ( losing ) accumulator ( s ) , or both ( Vickers , 1979; Kiani and Shadlen , 2009; Zylberberg et al . , 2012; Kiani et al . , 2014; Van den Berg et al . , 2016 ) . The noisiness of the momentary evidence causes the DV to wander from its starting point , as in Brownian motion or diffusion , whereas the expectation ( i . e . , mean ) of the momentary evidence increments or decrements the DV deterministically . Noise is the main determinant of both RT and confidence when signal-to-noise is low , that is when choices are more stochastic ( less accurate ) . Recent evidence from neurophysiology ( Kiani and Shadlen , 2009 ) , brain stimulation ( Fetsch et al . , 2014 ) , and psychophysics ( Kiani et al . , 2014 ) supports such a mechanism . If the bounded accumulation of noisy evidence underlies choice accuracy , RT and confidence , then a selective manipulation of the noise should produce quantitatively consistent effects on all three measures . Specifically , were it possible to leave unchanged the expectation of each sample of momentary evidence while boosting the noise associated with it , then the bounded accumulation of the noisier samples should lead to ( i ) lower accuracy when the expectation of the momentary evidence is strong , ( ii ) faster reaction times when the momentary evidence is weak , and ( iii ) increased confidence when the momentary evidence is weak . The basic insight behind the latter two predictions is that with greater volatility , the DV tends to diffuse more quickly away from the starting point to achieve levels nearer the termination bound which are ordinarily associated with stronger evidence and thus greater confidence ( Figure 1 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 17688 . 003Figure 1 . Predicted influence of volatility on reaction time and confidence under bounded evidence accumulation . ( A ) ev1 ( t ) and ev2 ( t ) represent the time course of momentary evidence , for stimuli of low and high volatility , respectively . In bounded accumulation models , momentary evidence is integrated over time , until the accumulated evidence ( decision variable , DV ) crosses one of two bounds , here at \u00b1 B . Bound-crossing simultaneously resolves the choice that is made and the time it takes to make it ( decision time; the reaction time also includes a nondecision component , not shown ) . With greater noise , the decision variable tends to diffuse more rapidly , leading to faster responses . ( B ) Illustration of the effect of volatility on the distribution of decision times , for two bounded accumulation models that have the same drifts and bound heights but different diffusion coefficients . As in the single trial example , higher variance leads to faster responses . ( C ) Heat map depicting the association between the state of accumulated evidence and the probability that a decision rendered on this evidence is correct . The structure in this graph arises because there are several difficulty levels . More reliable stimuli ( e . g . , high motion coherence ) , which support high accuracy , contribute to large vertical excursions of the decision variable away from the starting point ( midpoint of the ordinate ) at short elapsed time , whereas less reliable stimuli contribute to equivalent vertical excursions at later times . Example probability contours are depicted with dashed lines . Because the volatility of the stimulus is not explicitly represented in this map , higher volatility would lead to greater confidence , because the decision variable diffuses more quickly from the starting point , leading paradoxically to states that are normally associated with more reliable sources . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 17688 . 003 These predictions have not been tested thoroughly , because a controlled method for selectively increasing noise is not known . A dissociation between accuracy and confidence led Rahnev et al . ( 2012 ) to conclude that transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) increased the neural noise associated with the representation of a visual pattern , and a similar dissociation led\u00a0Fetsch et al . ( 2014 ) to conclude that cortical microstimulation ( \u00b5Stim ) might affect both the mean and the variance of the representation of motion by neurons in the extrastriate visual cortex ( areas MT/MST ) . However , characterization of these effects of TMS and \u00b5Stim was inferred from behavior . Similarly , psychophysical studies that attempted to increase the noise through changes in the visual stimulus ( de Gardelle and Summerfield , 2011; Zylberberg et al . , 2014; de Gardelle and Mamassian , 2015 ) or attentional state ( Rahnev et al . , 2011; Morales et al . , 2015 ) did not characterize the influence of these manipulations on the neural signals that the brain accumulates to form a decision . We therefore sought a method to manipulate the variance associated with the neural representation of momentary evidence without affecting its mean . We achieved this with a manipulation of the motion information in a random dot motion ( RDM ) display , by adding a second level of randomness which increased its volatility but was unbiased with respect to the strength and direction of motion evidence . We verified that the manipulation has the desired properties by recording from direction selective neurons in the middle temporal ( MT ) and medial superior temporal ( MST ) areas of the macaque visual cortex . Neurons in these areas are known to represent the momentary evidence in tasks identical to those in our study ( Salzman et al . , 1990; Celebrini and Newsome , 1995; Ditterich et al . , 2003; Fetsch et al . , 2014 ) . We then used the volatility manipulation to test the influence of noise on the three observables of choice behavior\u2014accuracy , RT and confidence\u2014in monkeys and humans . \n The standard RDM stimulus is itself stochastic , meaning that a particular movie ( e . g . , shown on a trial ) is an instantiation of a random process that conforms to an expected motion strength and direction . On each video frame , a dot that had appeared \u2206t ms ago is either displaced ( i . e . , moved ) or replaced by a new dot at a random location within the stimulus aperture . The determination of displacement versus replacement is in accordance with a flip of a biased coin , and the magnitude of this bias confers the motion strength , which we refer to as a motion coherence ( c ) . The sign of c indicates the direction of the displacement along an axis ( e . g . , up/down ) . Thus the probability of displacement ( or unfairness of the coin ) is |c| . The randomly replaced dots fall in the neighborhood of other dots ( recently displayed ) and thus contribute random motion in both directions . In the standard RDM , the coherence , c , is fixed for the duration of an experimental trial ( e . g . , c\u00a0=\u00a00 . 13; Figure 2A , left , blue line ) . Here we introduce a second layer of variability , wherein the mean of c is fixed for the duration of a trial but the value of c varies randomly from video frame to video frame ( Figure 2A , left , red line ) . We will refer to trials that employ this doubly stochastic RDM as the 'high volatility' condition and those that use the standard RDM as 'low volatility' . 10 . 7554/eLife . 17688 . 004Figure 2 . Doubly stochastic random dot motion selectively influences the variance of evidence . Low and high volatility conditions are indicated by blue and red , respectively , in all panels . ( A ) Motion strength as a function of time for example stimuli with low and high volatility . Left: the coherence parameter is 0 . 128 for both stimuli , but in the high volatility condition this is the mean of a Gaussian distribution ( S . D . = 0 . 256 ) that is sampled on every video frame ( 75 Hz ) . Right: motion energy in favor of the positive direction . Both volatility conditions yield variation in the motion information , but the red curve exhibits more variation . ( B ) Mean and variance of the motion energy in support of the true direction of motion , computed separately for trials of low and high volatility ( N\u00a0= 66 , 805 trials ) . For all motion strengths , the mean ( upper ) is not affected by the volatility manipulation , whereas the variance is larger in the high volatility condition . Note the log scale for both axes . ( C ) Mean and variance of the neuronal response from direction selective neurons in areas MT/MST ( N = 26 single units and 21 multiunit sites; see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods ) . Spike counts were obtained from a 100 ms window beginning 100 ms after stimulus onset and standardized ( z-score ) for each neuron or multiunit site . The volatility manipulation produced a small increase in the average firing rate at the low coherences ( upper ) . This increase is likely due to the rectification of the noise by the nonlinear response of the neuron to motion in the preferred and anti-preferred directions , as sketched in the inset . The variance parallels the mean , but volatility has a more marked effect on variance at weak motion strengths . Note the linear scales . ( D ) Mean and variance of a difference between opposing pools of neural signals . The graphs extrapolate from panel C by constructing two pools of 100 or more neurons sharing a common preferred or anti-preferred direction , respectively . The mean of the difference variable ( \u03bc\u0394 ) is similar for both volatility conditions ( upper ) , whereas the variance of the difference variable ( \u03c3\u03942 ) is greater under high volatility ( lower ) . This relationship is shown for three values of correlation ( \u03c1 ) between the pools which span the plausible range . The correlation is negative because the opposing pools respond oppositely to fluctuations in the motion stimulus .

In addition to the estimate of variance from neural recordings , we used a 3-parameter characterization of the noise as a function of volatility and motion strength . The example is from the fit to behavioral data from monkey W in the reaction-time task . See Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods for details . Note the similarity of this graph to the estimates derived from the neural recordings in Figure 2D ( lower panel ) . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 17688 . 006 This description explains how the stimulus is generated , but it does not explain what effect it should have on perception or on the neural processing of motion . The construction of the RDM we use is in video frames displayed every 1/75 of a second . The visual system blurs these images over time , leading for example to the illusion that many more dots are present simultaneously than are actually displayed . The right panel of Figure 2A applies an established motion filter ( Adelson and Bergen , 1985 ) to the example movies parameterized by the low and high volatility traces shown in the left panel ( see also Video 1 ) . The filter extracts a time-blurred motion signal that provides a reasonable approximation to the firing rates of direction selective neurons in the primate visual cortex ( Britten et al . , 1993; Rust et al . , 2006; Hedges et al . , 2011 ) . The example highlights the subtlety of the volatility manipulation by reminding us that the standard RDM is itself volatile ( blue curve ) such that the overall contour of both traces is similar . Nonetheless , the extra bumps and wiggles in the red trace result from the random variation in c . 10 . 7554/eLife . 17688 . 007Video 1 . Example motion stimuli . The movie shows the low and high volatility examples depicted in Figure 2A . For illustration purposes , before showing the moving dots we indicate the coherence , volatility and direction of motion . These were not displayed to the participants in the experiment . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 17688 . 007 A more systematic analysis of the motion energy , displayed in Figure 2B , reveals that the mean is identical for low and high volatility stimuli , for all motion strengths ( upper panel ) , whereas the variance is larger for the high volatility stimuli ( lower panel ) . The linear relationship between the mean motion energy and c is known ( Britten et al . , 1993 ) , but the dependency of variance of the motion energy on c is less well characterized . For the low volatility condition ( Figure 2B bottom , blue trace ) , the motion energy variance is dominated by the variance in the number of coherently displaced dots , which obeys a binomial distribution , hence the monotonic increase over the range of |c| = 0 to 0 . 5 . For the high volatility condition ( Figure 2B bottom , red trace ) , the overall increase in variance is not surprising , because we have added a second layer of variability . Note that the effect is strongest at the low coherences , where the distribution of c in the high volatility condition spans both positive and negative values . These observations characterize the volatility present in the visual stimulus , but we are mainly interested in the noisy signals that the brain accumulates to form a decision . We therefore measured the impact of volatility on the response of direction selective neurons in cortical areas MT/MST ( Figure 2C ) . These neurons represent the momentary evidence used by monkeys to guide their choice , reaction time and confidence ( Salzman et al . , 1990; Celebrini and Newsome , 1995; Ditterich et al . , 2003; Fetsch et al . , 2014 ) in motion discrimination tasks . As previously shown ( Britten et al . , 1993 ) , the firing rate of MT neurons increases linearly , on average , as a function of motion strength in the neuron\u2019s preferred direction ( c\u00a0>\u00a00 , Figure 2C , upper panel , blue trace ) . The firing rate decreases linearly , but less steeply , as a function of motion strength in the anti-preferred direction ( c\u00a0<\u00a00 ) , giving rise to a bilinear function . We refer to the shallower slope for c\u00a0<\u00a00 as rectification ( Britten et al . , 1993 ) . These features are preserved under high volatility ( red trace ) , but there is a subtle increase in firing rate at the low coherences , which is explained by the rectification of neural responses when the distribution of c spans positive and negative values ( Figure 2C , inset ) . The variance of the neural response is known to scale approximately linearly with firing rate ( Tolhurst et al . , 1983; Vogels et al . , 1989; Geisler and Albrecht , 1997; Shadlen and Newsome , 1998 ) . Thus the variance curves in Figure 2C ( lower panel ) parallel the means . The high volatility condition adds to the variance in a manner that is exaggerated at the low motion strengths , consistent with the motion energy analysis above . We are now ready to consider the mean and variance of the quantity that is integrated toward a decision . We assume that the momentary evidence is the difference between the average firing rates from two pools of neurons with direction preferences for the two opposite directions ( e . g . , right-preferring minus left-preferring ) ( Shadlen et al . , 1996; Ditterich et al . , 2003; Hanks et al . , 2006 ) . The expectation of this signal can be estimated empirically by subtracting the mean firing rates of single neurons to motion in their preferred versus anti-preferred directions ( Figure 2D ) . Notice that the rectification is now canceled by the subtraction . The variance of this difference is more nuanced , drawing on two related considerations . First , because we did not record multiple single units simultaneously , we are not directly measuring the variance of the pools . Assuming a population of correlated neurons , the variance of the population mean differs from that of a single neuron by a multiplicative constant . For large pools , the variance is reduced to roughly r\u03c32 , where r is the average pairwise spike-count correlation for neurons within the pool and \u03c32 is the variance of the spike counts from a single neuron ( see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods ) . In MT , r is on the order of 0 . 2 for neurons with similar directional preferences ( Zohary et al . , 1994; Bair et al . , 2001 ) . An important implication of such correlation is that the beneficial effects of pooling saturate with modest number of neurons ( e . g . , 50\u2013100; [Zohary et al . , 1994; Shadlen et al . , 1996] ) . Second , the variance of the MT population comprises contributions from the variance in motion energy , described above , as well as a component that is independent of stimulus fluctuations . The opposing pool is assumed to share the component of variance originating in the stimulus , albeit of opposite sign , so the variances add rather than cancel in the difference . In contrast , the stimulus-independent component of shared variance ( e . g . , driven by fluctuations of arousal ) should have the same sign in the two pools and thus cancel in the difference . For a given coherence c and volatility v , the variance of the difference in neuronal response between a pair of populations selective to the preferred and anti-preferred directions is given by: ( 1 ) \u03c3\u0394|c , v2=r ( \u03c3c , v2+\u03c3\u2212c , v2\u22122\u03c1\u03c3c , v\u03c3\u2212c , v ) , where \u03c3c , v2 and \u03c3\u2212c , v2 are the variance of the spike counts for motion in the preferred and anti-preferred directions , r is the average pairwise correlation for neurons within the same pool , and \u03c1 is the correlation between the two pools with opposite direction preferences . The variances on the right-hand side of Equation 1 can be obtained from Figure 2C . However , without simultaneous recordings from neurons in the two pools , we cannot know how much of the variability is shared across neurons . In Figure 2D we explored three different values of \u03c1: 0 , \u22120 . 5 and \u22121 ( with r=0 . 2 ) . Note that positive values of \u03c1 are unlikely because a large portion of the shared variability comes from stimulus fluctuations , which as stated above induce changes in firing rate of opposite sign in the two pools . Under the low volatility condition , the variance of the difference variable increases slightly as a function of motion strength . This is a consequence of rectification and the tendency for variance to parallel the mean firing rate . More importantly , the doubly stochastic stimuli lead to a marked increase in \u03c3\u03942 , especially in the low coherence range where the impact on motion energy is greatest . This effect did not depend on the value of \u03c1 ( Figure 2D ) . From these complementary analyses of stimulus and neural response , we conclude that the volatility manipulation has negligible effects on the expectation of momentary evidence and more substantial effects on the variance , especially at weak motion strengths . This enables us to proceed with a critical test of the bounded accumulation framework . In what follows we attempt to ascertain whether a change in the variance of the momentary evidence , introduced by our volatility manipulation , affects decision speed , accuracy , and confidence in accordance with the predictions of bounded evidence accumulation . One monkey ( monkey W ) and three humans were required to decide between two possible directions of motion and , when ready , to indicate their decision by looking to one of two targets ( Figure 3A ) . For both high and low volatility conditions , stronger motion led to faster and more accurate choices . The main effect of high volatility was to decrease RTs , particularly at the weakest motion strengths ( Figure 3B , bottom row , red ) . This effect was robust for all three human subjects and the monkey ( Equation 16 , all p<0 . 03 , t-test , H0: \u03b22=0 ) . The manipulation affected the accuracy only subtly , and this was not statistically reliable for individual subjects in the RT task ( Figure 3B , top row; for the four subjects: p=[0 . 35 , 0 . 65 , 0 . 2 , 0 . 26] , Equation 17 , likelihood-ratio test ) . However , there was a significant effect of volatility on accuracy when pooling data across subjects and including data from the confidence tasks described below ( Equation 18 , p<0 . 0005 , likelihood ratio test , H0: \u03b22=0; see also Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 17688 . 008Figure 3 .

Although the volatility manipulation led to only a subtle reduction in overall accuracy , which was not statistically reliable , we believe this is because the volatility manipulation was attenuated at intermediate and strong motion strengths ( Figure 2 ) . Nevertheless , a small reduction in accuracy is apparent when examining only these intermediate and higher coherences .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 17688 . 010 The pattern of results in Figure 3B is consistent with the hypothesis that decisions are made when an accumulation of noisy evidence reaches a bound . Indeed , the smooth curves are fits of this model to the data , where the variance of the momentary evidence is the only parameter that we allowed to change between conditions of high and low volatility ( see below ) . The effect of increased volatility on RT is most apparent at motion strengths near zero , for two reasons: ( i ) the volatility manipulation has a larger impact on variance of the motion energy at the weak motion strengths ( Figure 2B ) , and ( ii ) the time to reach a bound is dominated by the variance of the momentary evidence , \u03c3\u03942 , when the motion strength is weak . For instance , when c\u00a0=\u00a00 , the average time required by a diffusion process to reach a bound is proportional to \u03c3\u0394\u22122 ( Shadlen et al . , 2006 ) . These considerations also help to reconcile the contrast between the striking effects of volatility on RT versus subtle effects on choice accuracy: the volatility manipulation mainly affects the weakest motion strengths where accuracy is already poor ( but see Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . The important point is that by increasing noise , the volatility manipulation accelerates the dispersion of the decision variable away from its expected value and nearer the termination bounds , hence faster RT . A similar idea guides intuitions about the effect of volatility on confidence in a decision . Confidence refers to the belief that a decision one is about to make ( or has just made ) is likely to be correct . In the framework of bounded evidence accumulation , it can be formalized as the conditional probability of a correct choice given the state of the DV , which comprises the accumulated evidence and elapsed decision time ( Equation 5 ) . For the motion discrimination task , this can be calculated by considering , for each possible state of the DV , the likelihood that it was the result of motion strength of the appropriate sign . We refer to this as a mapping between DV and probability correct ( Figure 1C ) . It depends on the set of possible motion strengths ( the prior distribution of c ) , the two possible volatility conditions , and the amount of time that has elapsed in the trial . We assume the subject has implicit knowledge of this mapping , and does not adjust it when a low or high volatility stimulus is shown . The latter seems justified because volatility levels were randomly interleaved and not cued or even mentioned to the subjects ( we evaluate this assumption , below , in several alternative models ) . Increased volatility should affect confidence because it mimics an increase in the diffusion rate . At low coherences in particular , its main effect on the DV is to accelerate its exodus away from neutral ( probability correct = 0 . 5 ) to more extreme values . Therefore , we predicted that volatility would increase confidence at low coherences , for the same reason that it speeds the RT . To test this prediction , we used two variants of the motion task , tailored to the abilities of monkeys and humans . Monkey D was trained on a motion discrimination task with post-decision wagering ( Kiani and Shadlen , 2009 ) ( PDW; Figure 4A ) . The monkey had to decide between two opposite directions of motion and report its decision after a memory delay . The monkey was rewarded for correct decisions and randomly on the 0% coherence trials . On half of the trials , the monkey had the opportunity to opt out of reporting the direction choice and to select instead a smaller but certain reward . The 'sure bet' option was not revealed until at least one-half second after motion offset ( i . e . , during the delay ) . The task design thus encouraged the monkey to perform the direction discrimination on every trial . After extensive experience with the standard RDM ( >100 , 000 trials; low volatility condition ) , we introduced the high volatility RDM on a random half of the trials . Single- and multi-unit recordings during performance of this task furnished the data for Figure 2C\u2013D , as well as additional neurophysiological analyses described later . 10 . 7554/eLife . 17688 . 011Figure 4 . Effect of volatility on post-decision wagering . ( A ) Task . The monkey viewed the motion display for random duration , controlled by the computer , followed by a memory-delay period . When the fixation point was extinguished , the monkey indicated the net direction of motion by making an eye movement to a left or right choice target in order to receive a liquid reward , if correct . On a random half of trials , the monkey was presented a third \u2018sure bet\u2019 option ( red target ) during the delay period , which if chosen resulted in a small but certain reward . ( B ) Decision confidence and accuracy . Volatility did not affect accuracy systematically ( upper ) , but the monkey waived the sure bet option more often on trials employing the high volatility display ( lower ) , indicating greater confidence . The effect was concentrated at weak and intermediate motion strengths . Standard errors are shown but are smaller than the symbols .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 17688 . 013 In both low and high volatility conditions , the monkey made rational use of the sure bet , opting out more often for weaker motion ( Equation 19 , p<10\u20136 , logistic regression , likelihood-ratio test; Figure 4B ) and for briefer stimuli ( Equation 19 , p<10\u20136 , logistic regression; Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . When the sure bet was offered but waived , choice accuracy was higher than when the sure bet was not offered ( Equation 20 , p<10\u20136 , logistic regression; Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . This indicates that the monkey was more likely to opt out of rendering its decision when the answer was more likely to be wrong . It implies that the decision to accept or waive the sure bet is based on the state of the evidence on the trial and not a general propensity associated with each motion strength ( Kiani and Shadlen , 2009 ) . The main question we wished to address is whether the high volatility condition would elicit fewer sure-bet choices , consistent with greater confidence . As shown in Figure 4B ( lower panel ) , the proportion of trials the monkey decided to waive the sure-bet option ( deciding instead for a riskier direction choice ) was greater on the high volatility trials ( Equation 19 , p<10\u20136 , likelihood-ratio test ) . Thus , high volatility increased the monkey\u2019s confidence , and did so despite a negligible effect on accuracy ( Figure 4B , upper ) . Further , like its effect on RT , volatility affected PDW mainly when the motion was weak ( Figure 4B , lower ) . We confirmed the relationship between volatility and confidence in human participants . Instead of using PDW , we asked subjects to report their confidence on a scale from \u201cfeels like I\u2019m guessing\u201d to \u201ccertain I\u2019m correct . \u201d The same three observers that performed the reaction time task participated in this second experiment . The RDM ( low or high volatility , randomly interleaved ) was displayed for a fixed 200 ms on each trial , after which they reported the perceived direction of motion ( left or right ) and the confidence in their decision . Participants reported the choice and the confidence rating by looking at a particular position on one of two elongated targets ( Figure 5A ) , where the left or right target specified the motion choice and the vertical position was used to indicate confidence . They were allowed to adjust their gaze to the desired level before finalizing their combined choice and confidence report ( Figure 5A ) . We thus encouraged subjects to use all available information in the 200 ms stimulus for both reports ( Van den Berg et al . , 2016 ) . The results from the human observers were similar to those from the monkey . Naturally , subjects were more confident for high coherence stimuli ( Equation 21 , p<10\u20136 , t-test; Figure 5 ) . They also reported higher confidence for the high volatility stimuli , and the effect was most apparent for the low coherence stimuli ( Equation 21 , p<0 . 0004 , t-test ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 17688 . 014Figure 5 .

Decision confidence and accuracy in the human confidence task . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 17688 . 015 So far , the effect of volatility has been described qualitatively . Now we show how a single bounded accumulation model can account for the combined effect of motion strength and volatility on choice , accuracy and RT . In the model , choice , RT and confidence result from the accumulation of noisy momentary evidence as a function of time , until the integral of the evidence ( the decision variable , DV ) reaches one of two bounds , or for the PDW and confidence tasks , until the stimulus is curtailed . In the latter case , the sign of the DV determines the choice . The DV is updated at each time step by the addition of a constant , proportional to motion strength , plus a draw from a zero-mean Gaussian distribution . In the language of drift-diffusion , the former gives rise to deterministic drift and the latter to a Wiener process scaled by a diffusion coefficient . The noise is itself comprised of stochastic contributions from the stimulus and its neural representation . Many studies make the simplifying assumption that the variance of the momentary evidence is fixed and independent of motion strength ( Ditterich et al . , 2003; Palmer et al . , 2005; Shadlen et al . , 2006 ) . This would be the case if the momentary evidence obeyed the idealization in Figure 2B and if the neural responses of rightward and leftward preferring neurons exhibited variance that scaled linearly with mean . Then the difference between population responses would have the same variance for all motion strengths . However , the partial rectification ( Figure 2C ) implies that the variance of the difference should increase as a function of motion strength . We characterize the dependency of the diffusion coefficient on motion strength and volatility based on the empirical observations of Figure 2 . These analyses showed that ( i ) the variance of the momentary evidence increases with motion strength , and ( ii ) the difference in noise between volatility conditions is larger at 0% coherence and decays gradually for stronger motion . We capture these observations with a simple parameterization of the diffusion coefficient ( Equations 2 and 3 ) . First , we assumed that in the low volatility condition , the variance of the momentary evidence increases linearly with motion strength ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1 , blue trace; note the log scale of the abscissa ) . Second , we modeled the additional variability introduced by the doubly-stochastic manipulation as a variance offset at 0% coherence that decays exponentially as motion strength increases ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1 , red trace ) . The framework can explain confidence if we assume that the brain has implicit knowledge of ( i ) the state of the accumulated evidence , ( ii ) the elapsed deliberation time , and ( iii ) the mapping of time and evidence to the probability of making a correct choice ( Figure 1C ) . Time matters because the same level of accumulated evidence is associated with lower levels of accuracy if the evidence was accrued over longer periods of time ( Figure 1C ) . In PDW , a sure-bet choice supersedes a direction decision if the probability correct ( estimated from the state of accumulated evidence and the decision time ) is lower than a criterion \u03a6 . In the human confidence task , probability correct is transformed into a confidence rating through a monotonic transformation ( Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods ) . The solid curves in Figures 3\u20135 are model fits . The model was fit to maximize the likelihood of the observables ( choice and RT in the reaction time task; choice and sure bet in PDW ) . Best-fitting parameters are shown in Table 1 . In the confidence task , we fit one parameter per subject ( \u03ba; see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods ) . This parameter was fit to maximize the likelihood of the direction choices . All other parameters were taken from the RT task , performed by the same participants . Therefore , the confidence curves in Figure 5B can be considered predictions of the model . These predictions capture the trend well , supporting the notion that time and accumulated evidence are the main determinants of confidence in a perceptual choice , even when noise is under experimental control . The overall quality of the fits\u2014across all tasks and both species\u2014indicates that the influence of motion strength and volatility on choice , reaction time and confidence can be explained by a common mechanism of bounded evidence accumulation . 10 . 7554/eLife . 17688 . 016Table 1 .

Up to now , we have attempted to explain the data on the assumption that subjects apply the same mapping between the accumulated evidence ( the DV ) and the probability that a decision rendered upon that evidence will be correct ( i . e . , confidence ) , regardless of the volatility condition . As stated earlier , the mapping is derived from all possible motion strengths , directions , and volatility conditions . Thus , we assume that subjects do not infer the noisiness of incoming evidence , or that if they do , they do not revise the mapping accordingly . An alternative is that the brain infers an estimate of the noisiness of the stimulus , in real time , to adjust the parameters of the decision process ( Deneve , 2012; Qamar et al . , 2013 ) or the evaluation of confidence ( Yeung and Summerfield , 2012 ) . This is a reasonable proposition , at least in principle , because the sample mean and variance of the motion energy can be used to classify volatility conditions with 90% accuracy ( see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods ) . We evaluated several 'two map' models which apply a different mapping between the DV and probability correct for each volatility condition . The first two-map model implements the assumption that subjects have full and immediate knowledge of the volatility condition on each trial . Although the maps are qualitatively similar ( compare the iso-confidence contours of Figure 6A ) , the consequence of having separate maps is to reduce the effect of volatility on confidence . When fit to data , this two-map model produces visibly worse fits than the model that relies on a common map , despite having the same number of parameters ( Figure 6B; \u2206BIC\u00a0=\u00a0252 . 4 favoring the common-map model; see Table 2 for parameter fits ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 17688 . 017Figure 6 .

For the second two-map model , the assessment of volatility is not instantaneous but evolves over the course of a trial . For simplicity , we assumed that the probability of correctly identifying the volatility condition increases monotonically at a rate determined by a free parameter ( see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods ) . Interestingly , the rate estimated from the best fit is exceedingly slow . For example , after 1 s of viewing , the weight assigned to the appropriate volatility map is just 1% . In other words , the confidence is dominated by the common mapping , consistent with our assumption . The fit is indistinguishable from the common-map model depicted in Figure 4 ( see Table 2 ) , and the BIC statistic revealed that the addition of the extra parameter was not justified ( \u2206BIC = 7 . 24 ) . We also considered the possibility that subjects used different termination criteria ( bound heights ) on low and high volatility trials . For the PDW task , this amounts to the addition of an extra free parameter in the first two-map model above . This model was also inferior to the simpler common-map model ( \u2206BIC\u00a0=\u00a0127; see Table 2 for parameter fits ) . This is not surprising because in the PDW task , stimulus duration is controlled by the experimenter , and bounds merely curtail the expected improvement in accuracy on longer duration stimuli . We also fit a model for the RT task that allowed the bounds to be different for the two volatility conditions . This led to a marginal increase in the likelihoods , but not enough to justify the addition of the extra parameter ( \u2206BIC = [29 . 4 , 7 . 7 , 27 . 3 , 12 . 1] for the four subjects; Table 2 ) . These analyses of alternative models support our assumption that subjects applied a common mapping and decision strategy on trials of low and high volatility . We do not believe this holds generally but is likely a consequence of the particular volatility manipulation and task designs we employed . Indeed , the normative strategy for several model tasks , which approximate those in our study , would apply different bounds and mappings to the two volatility conditions ( see Appendix ) . The full normative solution for the tasks we used is not known . Hence , we do not know if our subjects performed suboptimally or if they were simply unable to identify the volatility conditions without adding additional costs ( e . g . , effort and/or time ) . The role of the neural data in this study was to validate and characterize the volatility manipulation in a population of neurons known to represent the momentary evidence used to inform decisions and confidence ( Salzman et al . , 1990; Ditterich et al . , 2003; Hanks et al . , 2006; Fetsch et al . , 2014 ) . Nevertheless , there are features of this limited data set which are germane to findings associated with the confidence task in particular . We share them in Figure 7 , accompanied by the proviso that the data set is limited . 10 . 7554/eLife . 17688 . 019Figure 7 . Trial-to-trial covariation between neural activity and behavior . ( A ) Average of the firing rate residuals , sorted by choice . The residuals are obtained by subtracting the average response to each motion strength and direction from the smoothed single-trial response . Positive values denote higher than average activity in support of the chosen alternative . Separate averages are shown for low ( blue ) and high ( red ) volatility trials . The vertical arrows show the time when the curves first differ from baseline , estimated with a curve-fitting procedure ( see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods ) . The associated horizontal lines are \u00b1 one standard error of the latency estimates ( bootstrap ) . Shading shows \u00b1 1 s . e . m . across trials . ( B ) Difference in firing rate between the response to the preferred and the anti-preferred direction , for high-coherence trials . Trials of low and high volatility are shown in blue and red , respectively . Error bars represent s . e . m . across neurons . ( C ) Average of the firing rate residuals for trials in which the sure-bet target was chosen . For statistical power , we grouped trials from both volatility conditions . Neural responses are lower than average when the correct target is in the neurons\u2019 preferred direction ( positive coherences , magenta ) , and above average when the motion is in the non-preferred direction ( negative coherences , indigo ) . The arrow indicates the time at which the average residuals become significantly different from each other . ( D ) Average firing rate residuals sorted by choice , shown separately for trials where the sure bet was ( green ) or was not ( orange ) available . The average is greater when the sure bet was available but waived , consistent with the notion that the monkey waives the sure-bet target more often when the evidence appears to be stronger . The latency estimate ( arrow ) indicates the time that the difference between the curves becomes significant , which is similar to the time at which the neural activity is informative of the monkey\u2019s choice ( A ) . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 17688 . 019 Consistent with earlier reports ( Britten et al . , 1992 ) , trial to trial variation in the activity of neurons in MT/MST were indicative of the choice that the monkey was about to make . Figure 7A shows averaged residual responses , formed by subtracting the mean response for each motion strength as a function of time and multiplying by \u00b11 if the monkey chose the preferred of anti-preferred direction , respectively . Positive residuals therefore indicate an excess of activity in the chosen direction . For both low and high volatility conditions , trial-to-trial variation in the neural response was reflected in the monkey\u2019s choices . The fluctuations were more informative in the high volatility condition , presumably because they were induced by exaggerated variance in the motion display itself ( e . g . , Figure 2A ) . Notably , the time course of choice-related signals evolved with similar latencies in the low and high volatility conditions . The latencies were comparable to that of the direction selective signal itself ( Figure 7B ) , suggesting that the choice was informed by the earliest motion information available in the stimulus ( Kiani et al . , 2008 ) . The influence of neural variation declines over 200 ms , consistent with the idea that the brain terminates some decisions before the end of the stimulus presentation ( Kiani et al . , 2008 ) . The trial-by-trial variation in neural activity was also correlated with the decision to accept or waive the sure-bet option , when it was offered . Monkeys should opt out of the direction decision when the evidence is weak , and waive the sure bet when the evidence is strong . For positive coherences ( i . e . , net motion in the preferred direction ) , the residuals of firing rate were on average negative ( Figure 7C , magenta trace ) . This implies that the monkey tended to opt out of the direction decision when the neural representation of the evidence was weaker than average . For negative coherences ( net motion in the non-preferred direction ) , the residuals were positive on average ( Figure 7C , blue trace ) , for an analogous reason . The difference between the two traces furnishes an estimate of the time course over which MT/MST neurons inform the decision to opt out . Notice the similarity in the time course of the choice and confidence signals ( compare Figure 7A and C ) . The latency estimate derived from Figure 7C was unreliable ( arrow and horizontal error bar , Figure 7C ) , but it was corroborated by a complementary analysis of the trials in which the monkey waived the sure bet ( Figure 7D ) . Here we compared the average firing rate residuals on trials when the monkey waived the sure-bet option ( green trace ) with those on trials when the sure bet was not available ( orange trace ) . We expect these traces to differ if the monkey waves the sure bet on trials when the neural responses are stronger . The point of divergence of the two traces in Figure 7D furnishes a more reliable estimate of the latency with which confidence signals are represented in the neuronal response ( arrow ) . These results indicate that early motion evidence simultaneously informs both choice and confidence ( Zylberberg et al . , 2012 ) . They are inconsistent with the proposal that choice and confidence are resolved in strict succession , as these predict that confidence selectivity ought to emerge later than choice-related signals ( Pleskac and Busemeyer , 2010; Navajas et al . , 2016 ) . \n We have shown that a stimulus manipulation that increases the variance of the momentary evidence bearing on a decision\u2014what we term volatility\u2014increases both the speed of the decision and the confidence associated with it . Testing the influence of volatility on the decision process is difficult , because it requires independent control over the signal and the noise in the evidence . We mimicked a manipulation of noise by changing the statistical properties of a dynamic stimulus . Our approach differs from recent studies that have attempted to vary evidence reliability through stimulus manipulations ( de Gardelle and Summerfield , 2011; Zylberberg et al . , 2014; de Gardelle and Mamassian , 2015 ) in that we ( i ) applied the manipulation to a well studied motion task for which much is known about the underlying physiology; ( ii ) verified the effect of the manipulation by recording from neurons in the visual cortex of the macaque , and ( iii ) showed how a framework based on the bounded accumulation of evidence can account for the joint effect of volatility on choice , reaction time and confidence . The modeling framework pursued here was able to explain the observed pattern of choices , RTs and confidence in a quantitatively coherent way ( Figures 3\u20135 ) , even predicting subjects\u2019 confidence ratings ( Figure 5B ) based on a fit to their RT data from a separate experiment ( Figure 3B ) . The intuition is that increased volatility disperses the decision variable away from its expectation . For low coherences , it accelerates departure from the starting point ( i . e . , neutral evidence ) and closer to one of the decision bounds . This tendency to arrive at larger absolute values of accumulated evidence\u2014in support of either choice\u2014leads to faster and more confident decisions ( Zylberberg et al . , 2012; Maniscalco et al . , 2016 ) . The intuition would apply to any theoretical framework that would associate confidence with the absolute deviation of a DV from neutral . This includes models based on signal detection theory ( Clarke et al . , 1959; Ferrell and McGoey , 1980; Macmillan and Creelman , 2004; Kepecs and Mainen , 2012; Fleming and Lau , 2014 ) ; however , these models ignore the temporal domain and are thus unable to account for RT or the strong correlation between deliberation time and confidence ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1 ) ( Henmon , 1911; Pierrel and Murray , 1963; Vickers et al . , 1985; Link , 1992; Kiani et al . , 2014 ) . These intuitions and our fits to the data rest on the assumption that subjects do not change their decision strategy based on the volatility of the evidence on a particular trial . On all trials , we assumed subjects applied the same termination policy ( i . e . , decision bound ) and the same mapping between the state of the evidence and confidence , for both volatility conditions as well as for all motion strengths ( Gorea and Sagi , 2000; Kiani and Shadlen , 2009 ) . We considered and rejected alternative models in which the brain uses volatility to adjust the mapping and/or the decision bound . In particular , if different mappings between DV and confidence were used for the low and high volatility conditions , a larger excursion of the DV would be required in the high volatility condition to reach the same level of confidence , predicting a pattern of post-decision wagering behavior that was not supported by our data ( Figure 6 ) . In the RT task , volatility could be used to adjust the height of the decision bound in the face of lower reliability in order to maximize reward rate ( Deneve , 2012; Drugowitsch et al . , 2014 ) . Indeed , the normative solution for a simplified version of the RT task is to increase the bound height on high volatility trials , which nevertheless leads to slightly faster responses than for low volatility trials when the motion is weak ( Appendix 1\u2014figure 1 ) . However , this idea presupposes knowledge of reliability on the trials , which ought to predict lower confidence in the high volatility condition . Thus , models that posit an online estimation of reliability [cf . , Deneve ( 2012 ) ; Yeung and Summerfield ( 2012 ) ; Qamar et al . ( 2013 ) ] make predictions that run counter to one or more of the trends we observed . This does not mean humans and monkeys are incapable of using information about stimulus reliability or difficulty to adjust their decision policy , and perhaps they would have in other circumstances ( Qamar et al . , 2013; Shen and Ma , 2016 ) . For instance , had we used only a very difficult and a very easy condition , there would be a stronger incentive to ascertain the difficulty of the decision online and use different termination criteria for each condition . However , our experiment\u2014in particular , the mixture of interleaved motion strengths and the volatility manipulation\u2014is representative of a broad class of decisions for which the reliability of the evidence is unknown to the decision-maker before beginning deliberation and not readily apparent from a small number of samples . In such circumstances , an estimate of reliability might be viewed as another decision , which would entail ( i ) specification of alternative hypotheses about reliability , ( ii ) defining which stimulus features constitute evidence bearing on these hypotheses , ( iii ) accumulating the relevant evidence , and ( iv ) specifying a termination criterion for this decision . Such an evaluation must balance the benefits derived from the use of reliability to adjust the parameters of the decision process trial by trial , with the associated cost in time and effort . Even if subjects were cued explicitly about reliability , it is not clear that they would adjust the decision criteria on a trial-by-trial basis . In a detection task where the stimulus categories were signaled by an external cue , human subjects did not adjust the decision criterion to the levels used when each stimulus category was presented on its own ( Gorea and Sagi , 2000 ) . Instead , subjects behaved as if they assumed a common distribution of signals encompassing all stimulus conditions and applied a single decision criterion . Our volatility manipulation was more subtle than an explicit cue , but we do not doubt that our subjects could perform above chance in a 2AFC experiment if they were trained to identify the higher volatility stimulus among a pair sharing the same motion strength . If nothing else , they could monitor their own decision times and confidence . However , when a mixture of different levels of volatility are presented in a sequence of otherwise similar events ( trials ) , subjects appear to combine trials of low and high volatility to form a single internal distribution with signed coherence as the only relevant dimension . Our results highlight limitations to the brain\u2019s capacity to extract and exploit knowledge of volatility . Our study may therefore be of interest to psychologists and behavioral economists ( d' Acremont and Bossaerts , 2016 ) . Systems with multiple interacting units , like financial markets , sometimes give rise to 'leptokurtic' distributions , referred to as those where the probability of extreme events is larger than expected from normal distributions ( Mandelbrot , 1997 ) . A simple way of constructing leptokurtic distributions is by mixing Gaussian distributions that have the same mean but different variances , similar to our doubly stochastic ( high volatility ) stimulus . When interpreting \u2018leptokurtic\u2019 noise , people appear to overreact to outliers . For instance , when making stock investment decisions , people often misinterpret large fluctuations as evidence for a fundamental change in expected value ( De Bondt and Thaler , 1990 ) . Similarly , our subjects interpreted the 'outliers' introduced by our doubly stochastic procedure ( motion bursts of unlikely strength given the average motion strength of the trial ) as if they were caused by a higher coherence stimulus . In this sense , they behaved as if the noisy samples they acquired were generated by a mesokurtic distribution ( e . g . , Gaussian ) . Is intriguing to think that the inferences and biases that people display in simple decisions about stochastic motion may bear on how they interpret and act upon stochastic signals operating over longer time scales . \n Three humans and two monkeys performed one or more tasks where they had to make binary choices about the direction of motion of a set of randomly moving dots drawn in a circular aperture . Dots could move in one of two opposite directions , and were generated as described in previous studies ( e . g . , [Roitman and Shadlen , 2002] ) . Briefly , three interleaved sets of dots were drawn in successive frames ( monitor refresh rate: 75\u00a0Hz ) . When a dot disappeared , it was redrawn 40 ms later ( i . e . , 3 video frames ) either at a random location in the stimulus aperture or displaced in the direction of motion . We refer to trials where the probability of coherent motion is fixed within the trial as \u2018low volatility\u2019 , and trials where it varies within the trial as \u2018high volatility\u2019 . Trials of low and high volatility were uncued and randomly interleaved . Example stimuli can be seen in Video 1 . We studied the relationship between volatility and decision speed with a reaction-time version of the random-dot motion discrimination task ( Roitman and Shadlen , 2002 ) . Three human participants completed 6631 trials ( subject S1: 2490 trials; S2: 2070; S3: 2071 ) , and one macaque ( monkey W ) completed 14 , 137 trials . Each trial started with subjects fixating on a central spot ( 0 . 33\u00b0 diameter ) for 0 . 5\u2009s . Then two targets ( 1 . 3\u00b0 diameter ) appeared on the horizontal meridian at an eccentricity of 9\u00ba to indicate the two possible directions of motion . Observers had to maintain fixation for an additional 0 . 3\u20130 . 7\u2009s ( sampled from a truncated exponential with \u03c4\u00a0=\u00a00 . 1 s ) and were then presented with the motion stimulus , centered at fixation and subtending 5\u00b0 of visual angle . Dot density was 16 . 7 dots/deg2/s , and the displacement of the coherent dots was consistent with apparent motion of 5 deg/sec . Feedback was provided after each trial . Correct decisions were rewarded with a drop of juice ( monkey ) or a pleasant sounding chime ( humans ) . Errors were followed by a timeout of 1 ( human ) or 5 ( monkey ) seconds , and , in humans , also accompanied by a low-frequency tone . For the monkey , a minimum time of 950 ms was imposed from dot onset to reward delivery ( e . g . , Hanks et al . , 2011 ) in order to discourage fast guessing . Trials employing 0% coherence motion were deemed correct with probability \u00bd . A second monkey ( monkey D ) was trained to perform a direction discrimination task with post-decision wagering ( Kiani and Shadlen , 2009 ) . After acquiring fixation , two targets appeared ( 6 . 5\u20139\u00b0 eccentricity ) to indicate the alternative directions of motion , followed by the motion stimulus after a variable time ( truncated exponential; range 0 . 3\u20130 . 75 s , \u03c4\u00a0=\u00a00 . 25 s ) . Motion viewing duration was sampled from a truncated exponential distribution ( range\u00a00 . 1\u20130 . 93 s , \u03c4\u00a0=\u00a00 . 3 s ) . After motion offset , the monkey had to maintain fixation for another 1 . 2 to 1 . 7 s . During this delay , a third target ( sure-bet target; Ts ) appeared on half of the trials , no earlier than 0 . 5 s from motion offset , positioned perpendicular to the axis of motion . After this delay , the fixation point disappeared , cueing the monkey to report its choice . Correct decisions led to a juice reward , and incorrect decisions led to a timeout ( 5 s ) . Selecting the sure-bet led to a small but certain reward , roughly equivalent to 55% of the juice volume received in correct trials . The monkey performed a total of 65 , 751 behavioral trials , a subset of which ( 44 , 334 trials ) were accompanied by neurophysiological recordings . By convention , positive motion coherences correspond to the preferred direction of motion of the recorded neurons . When paired with neural recordings , the speed and direction of motion , and the size of the circular aperture , were adjusted to match the properties of the neuron or multiunit site under study ( see below ) . The relationship between volatility and confidence was also studied in a task that required explicit confidence reports . After the subject fixated a central spot , two crescent-shaped targets appeared on each side of the fixation ( Figure 5 ) . The targets were the left and right arcs of a circle ( radius 10\u00b0 visual angle ) centered on the fixation point . These arcs were visible for for 2\u03c0/3 radians ( i . e . , extending \u00b1 60\u00b0 angle above and below the horizontal meridian ) . The left ( right ) target ought to be selected to indicate that the perceived direction of motion was to the left ( right , respectively ) . Subjects were instructed to select the upper extreme of the targets if they were completely certain of their decision , and the lowermost extreme if they thought they were guessing . Intermediate values represent intermediate levels of confidence . Visual aid was provided by coloring the targets in green at the top , red at the bottom , with a gradual transition between the two . After a variable delay during which participants had to maintain fixation , the random dot motion stimulus was shown for a fixed duration of 200 ms . Dot speed , density and aperture size were identical to the RT experiment . After motion offset , the subjects were required to indicate their response by directing the gaze to one target . Decisions were reported without time pressure and subjects were allowed to make multiple eye movements until they pressed the spacebar to accept the confidence and the choice . The same participants that completed the RT task performed the confidence task ( subject S1: 1536 trials; S2: 2103; S3: 2107 ) . All animal procedures complied with guidelines from the National Institutes of Health and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Columbia University . A head post and recording chamber were implanted using aseptic surgical procedures . Multi- ( MU ) and single-unit ( SU ) recordings were made with tungsten electrodes ( 1\u20132 M\u2126 , FHC ) . Areas MT ( n = 13 SU and 9 MU sites ) and MST ( n = 13 SU , 12 MU ) were identified using structural MRI scans and standard physiological criteria . We did not observe substantial differences between the two areas in the main results ( Figure 2 ) and therefore pooled the data for all analyses . However , the sample size is too small to rule out subtle differences between areas . The electrode was advanced while the monkey viewed brief , high-coherence random-dot motion stimuli of different directions while fixating a central target . When we encountered an area with robust spiking activity and clear direction-selectivity , we attempted to isolate a single neuron ( SortClient software , Plexon\u00a0Inc . , Dallas , TX , USA ) but otherwise proceeded with mapping of receptive field position , size , preferred speed and direction based on multiunit activity , as described previously ( Fetsch et al . , 2014 ) . When direction tuning was sufficiently strong ( >2\u2009S . D . separating firing rates for preferred vs . anti-preferred direction motion ) , we proceeded with the PDW task , tailoring the stimulus to the neurons\u2019 RF and tuning properties and aligning the choice targets with the axis of motion . Solid lines in Figures 3\u20135 represent fits ( or predictions ) of a bounded accumulation model . In the model , noisy momentary evidence is accumulated until the integral of the evidence ( termed the decision variable , DV ) reaches one of two bounds at \u00b1B ( t ) , or until the motion stimulus is terminated by the experimenter . The momentary evidence comprises samples from a Gaussian distribution with mean \u03bac and variance \u03c3v2 ( c ) , where \u03ba is a constant , c is the motion coherence , and v indicates whether the volatility is high or low . In most applications of diffusion models , the variance is assumed to be fixed and independent of motion strength , but our analyses of the motion energy and the neuronal recordings ( Figure 2 ) , motivate a more complex dependence of variance on c and v . To capture these trends parsimoniously , we modeled the variance as a linear function of motion strength ( 2 ) \u03c3low2 ( c ) =1+\u03b2|c| plus an offset for the high volatility , which was maximal at c\u00a0=\u00a00 and diminishing at higher coherences: ( 3 ) \u03c3high2 ( c ) =\u03c3low2 ( c ) +\u03b1e\u2212\u03b3|c| The three degrees of freedom ( \u03b2 , \u03b1 , \u03b3 ) control the slope of the coherence dependence , the effect of volatility at c=0 , and its diminishing effect at higher coherence ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . We constrained the variance in the high volatility condition to be monotonically increasing . Note that the unity constant in Equation 2 is necessary because a model in which the offset is a free parameter in addition to \u03ba and B ( t ) is equivalent to one in which the offset is set to 1 and \u03ba and B ( t ) are scaled appropriately ( Palmer et al . , 2005; Shadlen et al . , 2006 ) . For a given motion coherence and volatility ( v ) , the probability density function for the state of the decision variable ( x ) as a function of time ( t ) is given by a one-dimensional Fokker-Planck equation: ( 4 ) \u2202p ( x , t ) \u2202t=\u2212\u03bac\u2202p ( x , t ) \u2202x+0 . 5\u03c3v2 ( c ) \u22022p ( x , t ) \u22022x where p is the probability density of decision variable x at time t . Boundary conditions were such that the probability mass is 1 for x=0 at t=0 , and the probability density vanishes at the upper and lower bounds \u00b1B ( t ) . Confidence is given by the probability of being correct given the state of the evidence ( x ) and elapsed time , which could either correspond to the time of bound-crossing or the stimulus duration if no bound was reached . Because the direction decision depends on the sign of x , the sign of the decision variable must equal the sign of the coherence for the choice to be correct , except for 0% coherence trials that are rewarded at random . Therefore , ( 5 ) p ( corr|x , t ) =\u2211vp ( corr\u2223x , t , v ) p ( v|x , t ) p ( corr|x , t , v ) =\u2211c|sign ( c ) =sign ( x ) p ( c|x , t , v ) +12p ( c=0|x , t , v ) where t is either the time at which the bound was hit or the time at which the stimulus was curtailed . The distribution over coherences p ( c|x , t , v ) can be obtained by Bayes rule , such that p ( c|x , t , v ) \u221d\u00a0p ( x , t|c , v ) p ( c|v ) , where the constant of proportionality ensures that \u2211cp ( c|x , t , v ) =1 . This constitutes a mapping between the DV and probability correct , which is the basis for assignment of confidence to a decision ( Figure 1C ) . In general we assume that the same mapping p ( corr|x , t ) supports confidence ratings ( and PDW ) on all trials irrespective of volatility , but evaluate this assumption using the alternative models described below . The data were fit to maximize the likelihood of the parameters given the choice , confidence and RTs observed on each trial . In the RT task , the model parameters were maximum likelihood fits to choice and RT: ( 6 ) \u03be^RT=arg max\u03beRT ( \u2211i=1Nlog ( p ( choicei , RTi|ci , vi , \u03beRT ) ) ) where \u03beRT represents the model parameters for the RT task , i is the trial number and N is the total number of trials . The probability density function for the time of bound crossing ( decision times ) is obtained by numerical solutions to the Fokker-Planck equation . The difference between the reaction time and the decision time is the non-decision latency , assumed to reflect sensory and motor delays unrelated to motion strength or volatility . This latency is assumed Gaussian with mean \u03bctnd and standard deviation \u03c3tnd . The RT probability density function is obtained by convolving the p . d . f . of the decision times with the distribution of non-decision latencies . For the PDW task , the log likelihood is a sum of two terms , ( 7 ) \u03be^PDW=arg max\u03bePDW ( LS++LS\u2212 ) where LS+ ( LS\u2212 ) is the log-likelihood computed over trials with ( without ) the sure-bet target , and \u03bePDW are the model parameters . For trials without the sure target , the log-likelihood of the parameters is ( 8 ) LS\u2212=\u2211i=1Nlog\u2061 ( p ( choicei|ci , vi , Ti , \u03bePDW ) ) where the summation runs over trials without the sure target , and Ti is the duration of the stimulus on trial i . The argument of the summations is computed as follows . If pup ( t ) is the probability of crossing the upper bound at time t , then the probability of crossing the bound anytime before time T is ( 9 ) Pup ( T|c , v , \u03bePDW ) =\u222b0Tdt\u00a0pup ( t|c , v , \u03bePDW ) and ( 10 ) p ( choice=1|c , v , T , \u03bePDW ) =Pup ( T|c , v , \u03bePDW ) +p ( x>0 , t=T|c , v , \u03bePDW ) where choice '1' is associated with a positive DV ( i . e . , x>0 ) . In the equation , p ( x>0 , t=T|c , v , \u03bePDW ) is the probability that the decision variable ( x ) is positive at time T and that no bound has been reached before T . For trials where the sure-bet target was offered , we compute the likelihood of the parameters given the three possible responses in a trial: the two directional choices and the sure bet choice . We assumed that subjects opt out of reporting the direction choice and select the sure bet if the confidence in the decision is lower than a criterion , \u03a6 , which was the same for conditions of low and high volatility . The value identifies a probability contour like those depicted in Figure 1C . It demarcates a zone in the middle of the graph depicted in Figure 1C in which the state of the evidence would lead the subject to opt out . Therefore , the probability of opting out of the direction choice p ( o ) is ( 11 ) p ( o|c , v , T , \u03bePDW ) =\u222b\u2212B ( t ) +B ( t ) dx\u00a0p ( x , t=T|c , v , \u03bePDW ) \u210b ( \u03a6\u2212p ( corr|x , T ) ) +\u222b0Tdt\u00a0pup ( t|c , v , \u03bePDW ) \u210b ( \u03a6\u2212p ( corr|Bup ( t ) , t ) ) +\u00a0\u222b0Tdt\u00a0plo ( t|c , v , \u03bePDW ) \u210b ( \u03a6\u2212p ( corr|Blo ( t ) , t ) ) where \u210b ( x ) is a step function that evaluates to one if x>0 , and zero otherwise . The first term on the right-hand side of the equation integrates the probability density that has not been absorbed at a bound before time T and for which probability correct is lower than \u03a6 . The second and third terms allow for the possibility that even when a bound was reached , the probability correct at the bound is lower than the criterion \u03a6 . In practice , this only occurs ( e . g . , during fitting ) when the bound is too low or the criterion is too high . Bup ( t ) and Blo ( t ) correspond to the height of the upper and lower bounds at time t , respectively . For readability , we have omitted the dependence of p ( corr ) on some parameters ( e . g . , \u03bePDW ) . The probability of waiving the sure bet and making a direction choice follows the complementary logic: ( 12 ) p ( choice=1|c , v , T , \u03bePDW ) =\u222b0Tdt\u00a0pup ( t|c , v , \u03bePDW ) \u210b ( p ( corr|+B ( t ) , t ) \u2212\u03a6 ) +\u222b0+B ( t ) dx\u00a0p ( x , t=T|c , v , \u03bePDW ) \u210b ( p ( corr|x , T ) \u2212\u03a6 ) where the first term of the right-hand side corresponds to the probability of selecting choice '1' when the bound is reached , and the second term computes the probability of selecting this choice when no bound is reached before T . In the human confidence task , we performed a maximum likelihood fit to the choice reported on each trial: ( 13 ) \u03be^HCONF=argmax\u03beHCONF ( \u2211i=1Nlog\u2061 ( p ( choicei|ci , vi , Ti , \u03beHCONF ) ) ) where \u03be^HCONF is the maximum likelihood estimate of the parameters and the likelihood is computed as described by Equation 10 . We fit only one parameter per subject ( \u03ba ) . The rest of the parameters were taken from the RT task ( i . e . , from \u03be^RT; see Table 1 ) . Note that confidence was not used for the fits , and therefore the solid curves in Figure 5 can be considered predictions of the model . For the RT task , we allowed the bound height to change as a function of time , as suggested by previous work ( Churchland et al . , 2008; Hanks et al . , 2011; Drugowitsch et al . , 2012 ) . The upper and lower bounds were symmetric around zero , and were parameterized by a logistic function of time: ( 14 ) B ( t|a , d ) =\u00a0\u00b1B0 ( 1+expa ( t\u2212d ) ) \u22121 where a and d are the scale and location parameters of the logistic . The bound parameters were constrained to be the same for the two volatility conditions , except in the alternative model for the RT task where we fit separate B0 for the two volatility conditions ( Table 2 ) . In the human confidence task , the presence of bounds did not improve the quality of the fits . This implies that subjects used all the stimulus information to inform their choices , presumably because the stimulus duration was only 0 . 2\u2009s . In the PDW , a stationary bound ( i . e . , B ( t ) =\u00a0B0 ) improved the quality of the fits . In the human confidence experiment , we do not know how each subject maps a position on the rating scale ( position along the crescent target ) to probability correct . Therefore , we assumed a monotonic transformation between the expected probability correct p ( corr|c , v ) and saccadic end point . Probability correct p ( corr|c , v ) was obtained by marginalizing p ( corr|x , t ) over the state of the evidence ( x ) at the time of decision termination ( t ) . Because we did not include a bound in the human confidence task , t is the stimulus duration ( i . e . , T\u00a0=\u00a00 . 2 s ) . The distribution of the DV at decision time depends on coherence c\u00a0and volatility v , therefore ( 15 ) p ( corr|c , v ) =\u222b\u200bdx p ( corr|x , T ) p ( x , t=T|c , v ) The monotonic transformation \u2131 that maps probability correct to the average position in the rating scale \u27e8sac ( c , v ) \u27e9tr was constructed as a linear combination of three error functions plus a constant offset: \u2131 ( x ) =\u2211i=13wi\u00a0erfi ( x\u2212ois ) +k , where oi is an offset term , and s is a scaling parameter . The three linear weights and the offset k were fit to minimize the sum of squared differences between \u2131[p ( corr|c , v ) ] and \u27e8sac ( c , v ) \u27e9tr . Similar results were obtained using different parameterizations of \u2131 . For the PDW task , we explored three alternative 'two map' models . In the first , we used a different mapping between DV and confidence for each volatility condition . Each map is the one that should be used if the volatility condition of each trial were known ( i . e . , the one specified by the bottom row of Equation 5 ) . For the second two-map model , the assessment of volatility develops gradually during the trial . We assume that for a trial i with stimulus duration Ti , the probability that the decision maker can identify the trial\u2019s volatility is given by w ( Ti ) =1\u2212e\u2212Ti/\u03c4 . For trials where the sure bet was offered , we compute the probability of the action that was chosen by the monkey as a weighted average of the two probabilities: the probability that results from using a common map for both volatility conditions , which was weighted by ( 1\u2212w ( Ti ) ) , and the probability obtained from using the mapping that corresponds to the appropriate volatility of the trial , which was weighted by w ( Ti ) . The time constant \u03c4 was fitted to data . If \u03c4 is small , information about volatility builds up rapidly and the decision maker can use the appropriate map for each condition . Fitting the model to data showed that the volatility information develops very gradually , with w ( t ) being ~0 . 01 for a 1-s stimulus . For the third model , besides using different mappings between DV and confidence for the two volatility conditions , we also fit independent bounds , such that B0high\u00a0=\u00a0B0\u00a0+\u0394B0 where B denotes bound height ( see Table 2 ) . Best fitting parameters for the three alternative models and the BIC comparisons to the model of Figure 4 are shown in Table 2 . To examine whether high volatility leads to faster responses in the reaction time task , we fit a linear regression model for each subject where the reaction time is given by ( 16 ) RT=\u03b20+\u03b21|c|+\u03b22Iv where Iv is an indicator variable for volatility ( 1: high , 0: low ) , and \u03b2\u2019s are fitted coefficients . Unless otherwise indicated , the null hypothesis is that the \u03b2 term associated with Iv equals zero , evaluated with t-test ( t-statistics were derived using the parameter estimates and their associated standard errors [i . e . , the square root of the elements in the diagonal of the covariance matrix of the parameter estimates] ) . To evaluate the influence of volatility on accuracy , we used logistic regression , excluding trials of 0% coherence: ( 17 ) pcorrect=[1+e\u2212 ( \u03b20+\u03b21|c|+\u03b22Iv ) ]\u22121 The influence of volatility was evaluated with a likelihood-ratio test comparing models with and without the \u03b22 term . We also used logistic regression to evaluate the effect of volatility on accuracy when pooling data across subjects and experiments: ( 18 ) pcorrect=[1+e\u2212 ( \u03b20 , s , xIs , x+\u03b21|c|+\u03b22 , s , xIs , xIv ) ]\u22121 where Is , x are indicator variables for every combination of task and subject ( n\u00a0=\u00a08 ) . This equation parallels the structure of the previous one . The first term in the argument of the exponential allows fitting a different intercept for each combination of task and subject , and the third term allows for different intercepts on high and low volatility trials . The significance of the influence of volatility on accuracy was evaluated with a likelihood ratio test comparing nested models with and without the \u03b22 terms , with the test statistic evaluated against a \u03c72\u00a0distribution with n\u00a0=\u00a08 degrees of freedom . Only non-zero coherences were included in this analysis . Similarly , to evaluate the influence of volatility on the monkey\u2019s PDW behavior on trials where the sure bet was offered , we fit ( 19 ) pwaived=[1+e\u2212 ( \u03b20+\u03b21|c|+\u03b22Iv+\u03b23Td ) ]\u22121 where pwaived is the probability that the sure bet was declined , and Td is stimulus duration . We also examined whether availability of the sure bet influenced accuracy: ( 20 ) pcorrect=[1+e\u2212 ( \u03b20+\u03b21|c|+\u03b22Iv+\u03b23Td+\u03b24Is|c| ) ]\u22121 where Is is 1 if the sure bet was offered , and 0 otherwise . A positive \u03b24 indicates that the accuracy increases if the sure bet is offered but waived . In the human confidence task , we mapped subjects\u2019 confidence reports to a 0\u20131 scale , such that \u20180\u2019 stands for \u2018guessing\u2019 and \u20181\u2019 for \u2018full certainty\u2019 . To evaluate the significance of the effect of volatility on confidence we fit for each subject the following linear regression model: ( 21 ) conf=\u03b20+\u03b21|c|+\u03b22Iv While the motion coherence specifies the nominal strength of motion in the stimulus , the effective motion strength varies from trial to trial and even within trials , due to the random fluctuations in the stimulus . To extract the effective motion strength , we computed the motion energy in the stimulus ( Adelson and Bergen , 1985; Kiani et al . , 2008 ) , following published procedures which we briefly review here . We convolved the sequence of random dots presented on each trial with two pairs of spatiotemporal filters . Each pair of filters is selective for one of the two alternative directions of motion ( \u00b1x ) . Directional selectivity is achieved through the addition or subtraction of two space-time separable filters . As in previous work ( Kiani et al . , 2008 ) , the temporal impulse responses are: ( 22 ) fast ( t ) = ( 60t ) 3exp\u2061 ( \u221260t ) [13 ! \u2212 ( 60t ) 2 ( 3+2 ) ! ]slow ( t ) = ( 60t ) 5exp\u2061 ( \u221260t ) [15 ! \u2212 ( 60t ) 2 ( 5+2 ) ! ] The spatial filters are even ( mirror-symmetric ) and odd ( non-symmetric ) fourth order Cauchy functions: ( 23 ) even ( x , y ) =cos4\u2061 ( \u03b1 ) cos ( 4\u03b1 ) exp\u2061 ( \u2212y22\u03c3g2 ) odd ( x , y ) =cos4\u2061 ( \u03b1 ) sin ( 4\u03b1 ) exp\u2061 ( \u2212y22\u03c3g2 ) where \u03b1=tan\u22121 ( x/\u03c3c ) . The constants in Equations 22 and 23 were adjusted to match the apparent speed of the coherently moving dots . The two pairs of directionally selective filters were obtained through appropriate addition and subtraction of the product of a spatial and a temporal filter . Specifically , the two filters selective to the +x direction are given by \u2018slow \u00d7 even \u2013 fast \u00d7 odd\u2019 , and \u2018slow \u00d7 odd + fast \u00d7 even\u2019 . Filters selective to the -x direction are given by \u2018fast \u00d7 odd + slow \u00d7 even\u2019 , and \u2018fast \u00d7 even \u2013 slow \u00d7 odd\u2019 . The four directional filters were convolved with the 3-dimensional ( x , y , time ) stimulus . After squaring the output and adding the two filters that prefer the same direction , we compute opponent motion energy by subtracting -x from +x preferring responses . Finally , we average across space to obtain a temporal signal , etr ( t ) , which quantifies how motion strength varies within each trial . Because the motion energy has arbitrary units , which varies , for instance , with the size of the stimulus , we normalized etr ( t ) multiplying it by a constant \u03bb . The normalization constant was the same for all trials in a session , and was set such that the motion energy is , on average , equal to the motion coherence . This normalization is possible because the motion energy is a linear function of the motion coherence . The motion energy profile for etr ( t ) is shown in Figure 2A for an example trial . To characterize the mean and variance of the motion energy for high and low volatility ( Figure 2B ) , we first computed the average motion energy for each trial , i . e . etr=\u27e8etr ( t ) \u27e9t , ignoring the rise and decay times of the motion filters , that is from 50 ms after motion onset to 50 ms after offset . The mean and variance of etr was computed over subsets of trials grouped by motion coherence and volatility condition . We used logistic regression to determine if the motion energy profile of each trial of the PDW task contains enough information to identify the trial\u2019s volatility . We calculated the mean ( etr ) and an index of the dispersion ( etrv ) of the motion energy time course for each trial . The dispersion index was estimated as the variance of the distribution of motion energy values estimated at the frame rate , ignoring the autocorrelation in motion energy profile . Thus , etrv is more accurately described as a measure of dispersion of the motion energy profile on single trials rather than as an estimate of the variance . The mean and the dispersion of the motion energy were used together with the stimulus duration ( Td ) to train a logistic regression model to classify the volatility condition of each trial: ( 24 ) pvtr=[1+e\u2212 ( \u03b20+\u03b21|etr|+\u03b22etrv+\u03b23Td+\u03b24|etr|etrv ) ]\u22121 where pvtr is the probability that trial tr is of high volatility . After fitting the logistic model , we estimated the degree of overlap in the distributions of pvtr between trials of low and high volatility . The area under the ROC curve was 0 . 895 , indicating that there is information in the stimulus to reliably estimate the volatility condition of each trial , even for the brief stimulus presentations used in the PDW task . If we remove the interaction term ( \u03b24 ) the area under the ROC curve is 0 . 85 . To be clear , we do not put forward this calculation as a plausible model for inferring volatility . It merely serves to document that information is present in the stimuli to render a categorization possible . For simplicity , in what follows we refer to both single units and multiunit sites as \u2018neurons\u2019 . To investigate how the volatility manipulation affected the mean and variance of the neuronal response , we first counted spikes occurring between 100\u00a0ms and 200\u00a0ms from stimulus onset . To avoid artifacts produced by the response to the offset of the RDM stimulus , we restricted this analysis to trials where the motion stimulus was presented for at least 150 ms . The counts were standardized ( z-scored ) independently for each neuron and subsequently grouped across neurons to obtain a large array of normalized counts , str , where tr indexes the trial number across sessions . Figure 2C shows the mean ( \u03bcc , v ) and the variance ( \u03c3c , v2 ) of str computed over the subset of trials given by every combination of motion coherence and volatility condition . These analyses furnished empirical estimates of the mean and variance of the spike count as a function of motion strength and direction . Findings from neurophysiology ( Ditterich et al . , 2003 ) and computational modeling ( Mazurek et al . , 2003 ) suggest that the momentary evidence is proportional to the difference of firing rates between pools of neurons with opposite direction preferences ( e . g . , right-preferring minus left-preferring ) . The expectation of this difference variable ( \u0394 ) can be estimated empirically: ( 25 ) \u03bc\u0394|c , v\u00a0=\u00a0\u03bcc , v\u2212\u03bc\u2212c , v where c and -c indicate motion in the preferred and anti-preferred direction of the neuron , for motion strength c . The mean of the difference variable is shown in Figure 2D , with mean counts \u03bcc , v and \u03bc\u2212c , v obtained from Figure 2C . The variance of the difference variable ( \u03c3\u03942 ) was approximated as follows . Because the variance of a sum equals the sum of the covariances , if the average pairwise correlation for a pool of n neurons is given by r , then the variance of the average response of the pool is ( \u03c32n+n\u22121nr\u03c32 ) , where \u03c32 is the variance in the spike counts from a single neuron . As n becomes large ( in practice , above 50 to 100 neurons is sufficient ) , the variance of the pool converges to r\u03c32 . Further , there is a portion of the variance that is shared between neurons tuned to the preferred and anti-preferred directions . If the correlation between the average responses of populations of neurons with opposite directional preferences is given by \u03c1 , the variance of the difference variable as is given by Equation 1 of the main text . For the analyses depicted in Figure 7 , we extracted the spike times from each trial up to 50 ms after motion offset and then smoothed the spike counts with a centered boxcar filter with a 30 ms width . For the analysis of Figure 7B we computed , for each neuron , the difference in firing rate between the response to the preferred and the non-preferred directions , for trials of the highest coherence ( c\u00a0=\u00a00 . 512 ) . This difference was used to estimate the latency with which motion information is represented in these neurons , regardless of the choice . For the analyses of Figure 7A , C , D , we obtained the residuals of firing rate by subtracting , from each trial and time step , the average firing rate of the same neuron on trials having the same motion direction , coherence and volatility . To group trials across neurons , we divided the activity of each neuron by a normalization constant , given by the maximum average firing rate at the highest coherence ( i . e . , c = 0 . 512 ) . The latencies in Figure 7B were estimated with a curve fitting procedure based on the CUSUM method ( Ellaway , 1978 ) . In the CUSUM method , the latency of the difference between two conditions is estimated based the cumulative sum of the differences , thereby achieving robustness against the noisiness of individual data point . The cumulative sum of differences was fit to a curve composed of two lines , the first of which was constrained to have a zero slope [similar to Lorteije et al . ( 2015 ) ; Van den Berg et al . ( 2016 ) ] . The latency is then estimated as the time point when the two lines intersect . Standard errors of the latency estimates were derived with a bootstrapping procedure ( N\u00a0=\u00a01000 ) .", "headings": ["Abstract", "Introduction", "Results", "Discussion", "Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods"], "keywords": ["neuroscience"], "id": "elife-17688-v1"}
{"lay_summary": "Although aging might seem to be a passive process\u2014resulting simply from wear and tear over a lifetime\u2014it can actually be accelerated or slowed down by genetic mutations . This phenomenon has been most thoroughly studied in the nematode worm , Caenorhabditis elegans . Normally , this worm lives for just two or three weeks , but genetic mutations that reduce the activity of certain enzymes in a series of biochemical reactions known as the insulin/IGF-1 signalling pathway can extend its lifespan by up to a factor of ten , and similar effects have been seen in flies and mice . Lifespans can also be increased by blocking other signalling pathways or restricting the intake of calories . This increase in lifespan associated with the insulin/IGF-1 signalling pathway is known to involve a protein called DAF-16 and two kinases called AKT-1 and AKT-2 . Under normal conditions the AKT kinases add several phosphate groups to the DAF-16 , which prevents it from travelling to the nucleus of the cell . However , when genetic techniques are used to block the insulin/IGF-1 signalling pathway , the AKT kinases are unable to add the phosphate groups; this leaves the DAF-16 free to enter the nucleus , where it activates a network of genes that promotes longevity . In addition to kinases , the insulin/IGF-1 signalling pathway also involves enzymes called phosphatases that remove the phosphate groups from other proteins . In particular , a phosphatase called calcineurin is known to be involved in the regulation of lifespan , but the details of this process are not fully understood . Now , Tao et al . have carried out a series of genetic and biochemical experiments to determine how phosphatases exert their influence on aging . The results show that calcineurin targets DAF-16 , the same protein that is targeted by the AKT kinases . Moreover , another kinase also targets DAF-16 when the worm is exposed to heat , starvation or some other form of stress: this kinase , which is not involved in the insulin/IGF-1 signalling pathway , is called CAMKII . Tao et al . show that these kinases act on DAF-16 in different ways: CAMKII activates it by adding the phosphate group at a specific site known as S286 , whereas the AKT kinases deactivate DAF-16 because they add phosphate groups at different sites , thereby preventing it from entering the nucleus . Calcineurin neutralizes the effect of CAMKII by removing the phosphate group at S286 to deactivate the DAF-16 . In addition to shedding new light on the regulation of lifespan in C . elegans , the new results could improve our understanding of aging in humans , and also the development of diabetes and other age-related diseases , because the equivalent molecules in mammalian cells are regulated in similar ways .", "article": "The insulin-like signaling pathway maintains a relatively short wild-type lifespan in Caenorhabditis elegans by phosphorylating and inactivating DAF-16 , the ortholog of the FOXO transcription factors of mammalian cells . DAF-16 is phosphorylated by the AKT kinases , preventing its nuclear translocation . Calcineurin ( PP2B phosphatase ) also limits the lifespan of C . elegans , but the mechanism through which it does so is unknown . Herein , we show that TAX-6\u2022CNB-1 and UNC-43 , the C . elegans Calcineurin and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase type II ( CAMKII ) orthologs , respectively , also regulate lifespan through DAF-16 . Moreover , UNC-43 regulates DAF-16 in response to various stress conditions , including starvation , heat or oxidative stress , and cooperatively contributes to lifespan regulation by insulin signaling . However , unlike insulin signaling , UNC-43 phosphorylates and activates DAF-16 , thus promoting its nuclear localization . The phosphorylation of DAF-16 at S286 by UNC-43 is removed by TAX-6\u2022CNB-1 , leading to DAF-16 inactivation . Mammalian FOXO3 is also regulated by CAMKIIA and Calcineurin . \n Multiple signaling pathways , including insulin/IGF-1 signaling ( IIS ) , germline signaling , mitochondrial signaling , and the signaling pathways induced by dietary restriction , regulate aging in C . elegans ( Kenyon , 2005; Greer and Brunet , 2008 ) . The best characterized is the IIS pathway , which includes the upstream insulin/IGF-1 receptor DAF-2 and the downstream FOXO transcription factor DAF-16 . Signals from DAF-2 are transmitted through AGE-1 ( phosphoinositide 3-kinase ) and PDK-1 ( phosphoinositol-dependent kinase-1 ) to AKT-1 , AKT-2 , and SGK-1 , which phosphorylate DAF-16 and prevent it from translocating to the nucleus to activate a pro-longevity gene network . Reduction-of-function mutations of the kinase genes in the IIS pathway , from daf-2 to akt-1 , akt-2 , and sgk-1 , all extend lifespan in a daf-16-dependent manner ( Kenyon et al . , 1993; Morris et al . , 1996; Kimura et al . , 1997; Hertweck et al . , 2004 ) . Lifespan extension by reduced IIS is also observed in other species , including flies and mice , indicating that the pathway is conserved evolutionarily ( Kenyon , 2005; Greer and Brunet , 2008 ) . Compared with the kinases in the C . elegans IIS pathway , little is known about the protein phosphatases that neutralize the effects of the kinases . The only known example is PPTR-1 , a B56 regulatory subunit of PP2A , which directs PP2A to dephosphorylate AKT-1 at T350 , thereby inactivating the kinase ( Padmanabhan et al . , 2009 ) . DAF-18 , the C . elegans PTEN , is a phosphatidylinositol 3 , 4 , 5-trisphosphate ( PIP3 ) 3-phosphatase ( Ogg and Ruvkun , 1998 ) . The phosphatase for DAF-2 has not been identified , nor the one that regulates DAF-16 . Previously , loss-of-function ( lf ) mutants for tax-6 and cnb-1 , which encode the catalytic and regulatory subunits of C . elegans Calcineurin , respectively , were found to live longer than wild-type ( WT ) worms ( Dong et al . , 2007 ) . In mammalian systems , Calcineurin ( PP2B ) is a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent serine/threonine protein phosphatase that has diverse functions and affects both T cell activation and heart development ( Crabtree , 1999 ) . In C . elegans , Calcineurin regulates body size , thermotaxis , muscle contraction , and lifespan ( Bandyopadhyay et al . , 2002; Kuhara et al . , 2002; Lee et al . , 2004; Dong et al . , 2007 ) . The longevity phenotype of tax-6 ( lf ) is partially dependent on daf-16 ( Dong et al . , 2007 ) . More recent studies have shown that C . elegans Calcineurin can regulate lifespan by suppressing autophagy ( Dwivedi et al . , 2009 ) or inactivating CRTC-1 , a co-activator of CREB ( Mair et al . , 2011 ) . However , direct targets of worm Calcineurin have not been identified . In the current work , we addressed how worm Calcineurin TAX-6\u2022CNB-1 regulates lifespan . We discovered that DAF-16 was phosphorylated and activated by UNC-43 at the serine 286 ( S286 ) site . The phosphoryl group was removed by TAX-6\u2022CNB-1 . UNC-43 and TAX-6\u2022CNB-1 therefore regulate C . elegans lifespan through the reversible phosphorylation of DAF-16 . This regulatory mechanism has a different mode of action from the canonical IIS pathway because the phosphorylation activates , rather than represses , DAF-16 . Activation of DAF-16 by UNC-43 occurs in response to different types of stress signals , such as heat , starvation , and oxidation . UNC-43 and TAX-6\u2022CNB-1 can regulate DAF-16 independently of IIS , and the two signaling mechanisms appear to crosstalk , leading to coordinated action on DAF-16 . We also show that the regulation of FOXO by CAMKII and Calcineurin is conserved in mammalian cells . \n A genetic analysis has shown that a daf-16 ( null ) allele partially suppresses the longevity of the tax-6 ( lf ) mutant ( Dong et al . , 2007 ) . This observation suggested that daf-16 is either a direct or indirect downstream target of C . elegans Calcineurin; alternatively , it acts independently . To sort through these possibilities , we immunoprecipitated the 3xFLAG::DAF-16 protein using an anti-FLAG antibody from the lysate of MQD82 , a transgenic worm strain that expresses this fusion protein and TAX-6::GFP ( Figure 1A , lane 1 ) . TAX-6::GFP from this lysate was co-precipitated with the FLAG antibody ( Figure 1A , lane 4 ) , but no TAX-6::GFP was co-precipitated from the lysate of MQD2 , a strain expressing only TAX-6::GFP ( Figure 1A , lanes 2 and 5 ) . From the mixed lysates of two other transgenic strains , one expressing 3xFLAG::DAF-16 and the other expressing GFP , the GFP protein also failed to be precipitated by the FLAG antibody ( Figure 1A , lanes 3 and 6 ) . This result suggested that TAX-6 and DAF-16 interacted with each other in vivo . To determine whether the interaction was direct , we individually purified the recombinant His-tagged DAF-16 and C . elegans Calcineurin in the form of TAX-6\u2022GST-CNB-1 and then mixed them together before pulling down DAF-16 with nickel beads . Indeed , TAX-6\u2022GST-CNB-1 was pulled down successfully using His-tagged DAF-16 ( Figure 1B ) . Further analysis suggested that the C-terminal region of DAF-16 mediates the interaction with Calcineurin ( Figure 1C ) . Together , these results raised the interesting possibility that Calcineurin might directly regulate DAF-16 in C . elegans . 10 . 7554/eLife . 00518 . 003Figure 1 . C . elegans Calcineurin TAX-6\u2022CNB-1 directly binds to DAF-16 and negatively regulates DAF-16 nuclear localization . ( A ) DAF-16 and TAX-6 form a complex in vivo . Immunoprecipitation of 3xFLAG::DAF-16 expressed under the daf-16 promoter in WT C . elegans pulled down TAX-6::GFP expressed under the tax-6 promoter . The lysates were obtained from transgenic strains MQD82 ( co-expressing 3xFLAG::DAF-16 and TAX-6::GFP ) , MQD2 ( expressing TAX-6::GFP ) , MQD89 ( expressing 3xFLAG::DAF-16 ) , and CF1553 ( expressing GFP under a sod-3 promoter ) . ( B ) Calcineurin directly binds to DAF-16 . Purified recombinant TAX-6\u2022GST-CNB-1 was pulled down with Ni-NTA beads through its interaction with purified His-tagged DAF-16 . ( C ) The C-terminal region of DAF-16 most likely mediates the interaction with Calcineurin . GST-DAF-16 ( F-C ) , but not GST , GST-DAF-16 ( N ) or GST-DAF-16 ( N-F ) , pulled down TAX-6::GFP expressed in C . elegans ( strain MQD5 ) . The DAF-16 C-terminal region alone was not stable . Asterisk indicates full-length GST or GST fusion proteins . ( D ) DAF-16::6xHis::GFP is diffusely distributed in the WT animals but concentrated in the nucleus in tax-6 ( ok2065 ) animals . All GFP images shown in this paper are of L4 animals at 20\u00b0C unless otherwise indicated . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 00518 . 003 In WT animals , DAF-16 is phosphorylated by AKT and diffusely distributed throughout the cell , whereas in long-lived IIS mutants , transcriptionally active DAF-16 accumulates in the nucleus ( Henderson and Johnson , 2001; Lin et al . , 2001 ) . To determine whether DAF-16 translocates to the nucleus in long-lived Calcineurin mutants , we expressed DAF-16::6xHis::GFP using a daf-16 promoter in the tax-6 ( ok2065 ) background . The functionality of this transgene was verified in daf-2 ( e1370ts ) ;daf-16 ( mu86 ) animals; the double mutant expressing this transgene displayed the dauer formation-constitutive ( Daf-c ) and longevity phenotypes of the daf-2 ( e1370ts ) single mutant ( not shown ) . DAF-16::6xHis::GFP clearly accumulated in the nuclei of different types of cells in tax-6 ( ok2065 ) ( Figure 1D ) , similar to daf-2 ( lf ) and akt-1;akt-2 ( RNAi ) mutants ( Henderson and Johnson , 2001 ) . The above results strongly suggested that Calcineurin directly inhibited DAF-16 , presumably by dephosphorylating it . This result is in contrast to the transmission of IIS signaling to DAF-16 , during which phosphorylation of DAF-16 by AKT inhibits its nuclear accumulation . Thus , AKT and Calcineurin regulate the phosphorylation of different sites on DAF-16; otherwise , tax-6 ( lf ) would have a lifespan phenotype opposite to that of akt-1;akt-2 ( lf ) or daf-2 ( lf ) . In contrast , they all live longer than WT worms . Therefore , Calcineurin must counteract a different kinase that activates DAF-16 . We reasoned that nuclear accumulation of DAF-16 in the tax-6 ( null ) background should be dependent on a kinase that initiated the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of DAF-16 . Inactivation of this kinase should abolish the nuclear accumulation of DAF-16::GFP in tax-6 ( null ) animals . We thus conducted an RNAi screen of kinase genes using the DAF-16::6xHis::GFP reporter in tax-6 ( ok2065 ) worms , in which the GFP signal accumulates in the nucleus ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . We obtained from the Ahringer library a strong suppressor of nuclear DAF-16::GFP in an RNAi clone that targets unc-43 ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . The suppression was confirmed by an independent , homemade unc-43 RNAi construct ( Figure 2A ) . The unc-43 gene encodes the only Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent serine/threonine protein kinase , type II ( CAMKII ) , in C . elegans ( Reiner et al . , 1999 ) . UNC-43 and Calcineurin have opposing functions in locomotion and egg laying , two behavioral phenotypes that are regulated by G protein signaling ( Reiner et al . , 1999; Bandyopadhyay et al . , 2002 ) . However , they also have non-overlapping functions because unc-43 ( lf ) ;cnb-1 ( null ) double mutant animals arrest at the L1 larval stage , whereas both single mutants are viable ( Reiner et al . , 1999; Bandyopadhyay et al . , 2002 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 00518 . 004Figure 2 . The effect of tax-6 ( lf ) mutations on DAF-16 localization and lifespan requires unc-43 , the CAMKII gene whose effect opposes that of tax-6 . ( A ) unc-43 RNAi abolished DAF-16 nuclear accumulation in tax-6 ( ok2065 ) . Adult stage RNAi knockdown of tax-6 extended the WT lifespan ( p=0 . 001 ) ( B ) but may have slightly shortened the lifespan of unc-43 ( n498n1186 ) , a putative null mutant ( p=0 . 04 ) ( C ) .

An unc-43 RNAi clone from the Ahringer library suppressed the nuclear accumulation of DAF-16::GFP induced by tax-6 ( null ) . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 00518 . 007 To verify that UNC-43 and Calcineurin regulate DAF-16 antagonistically , we examined whether unc-43 ( RNAi ) could suppress the longevity of Calcineurin loss-of-function mutants and whether unc-43 ( gf ) had the same phenotype as tax-6 ( lf ) . Although RNAi knockdown of tax-6 during adulthood increased the lifespan of WT worms ( Figure 2B , Figure 2\u2014source data 1A ) , it failed to increase the lifespan of unc-43 ( null ) animals ( Figure 2C , Figure 2\u2014source data 1A ) . This observation is consistent with the hypothesis that Calcineurin removes the activating phosphorylation on DAF-16 caused by UNC-43 . We then examined n498 , an unc-43 gain-of-function ( gf ) allele harboring a missense mutation that results in constitutive activation of the kinase ( Park and Horvitz , 1986; Reiner et al . , 1999 ) . This unc-43 ( gf ) allele caused DAF-16::6xHis::GFP to accumulate in the nucleus ( Figure 2D ) , phenocopying tax-6 ( lf ) ( Figure 2A ) . Furthermore , the unc-43 ( n498 ) mutant lived 80% longer than the WT animals , and this lifespan extension was largely dependent on daf-16 ( Figure 2E , Figure 2\u2014source data 1B ) . Consistent with UNC-43 activating DAF-16 to prolong lifespan and TAX-6\u2022CNB-1 antagonizing such action , we found that the unc-43 ( gf ) ;cnb-1 ( lf ) double mutant lived even longer than either single mutant ( Figure 2F , Figure 2\u2014source data 1C ) . Previous studies have shown that UNC-43 activates NSY-1 and SEK-1 , two kinases within the MAP kinase pathway , to repress str-2 expression ( Sagasti et al . , 2001 ) . To determine whether UNC-43 activated DAF-16 through NSY-1 ( MAPKKK ) and SEK-1 ( MAPKK ) , we treated unc-43 ( n498 ) worms expressing the DAF-16::6xHis::GFP transgene with nsy-1 and sek-1 RNAi and found that neither gene affected DAF-16 nuclear accumulation induced by unc-43 ( gf ) ( Figure 3A ) . RNAi against pmk-2 , which encodes a p38 MAP kinase ( Kim et al . , 2002; Tanaka-Hino et al . , 2002 ) , also had no effect ( Figure 3A ) . sek-1 regulates DAF-16 localization in response to oxidative stress ( Kondo et al . , 2005 ) . To ascertain the role of sek-1 in the nuclear accumulation of DAF-16 induced by unc-43 ( gf ) , we crossed the DAF-16::6xHis::GFP animal to a unc-43 ( gf ) ;sek-1 ( null ) double mutant . Similar to the RNAi treatment , the km4 ( null ) allele of sek-1 failed to prevent DAF-16 nuclear localization in unc-43 ( gf ) animals ( Figure 3B ) . Moreover , the unc-43 ( gf ) ;sek-1 ( null ) double mutant did not live a shorter life than unc-43 ( gf ) animal ( Figure 3C , Figure 3\u2014source data 1 ) . Thus , we conclude that UNC-43 does not activate DAF-16 through the NSY-1/SEK-1 MAP kinase pathway . 10 . 7554/eLife . 00518 . 008Figure 3 . UNC-43 does not regulate DAF-16 localization through the NSY-1/SEK-1 MAPK kinase pathway . ( A ) RNAi knockdown of nsy-1 , sek-1 , and pmk-2 failed to block the nuclear accumulation of DAF-16::6xHis::GFP in unc-43 ( gf ) mutants . Worms were fed with the indicated RNAi bacteria from hatching and imaged at the L4 stage .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 00518 . 009 To test whether DAF-16 is a direct substrate of UNC-43 , we constructed transgenic strains that co-expressed 3xHA::UNC-43 and 3xFLAG::DAF-16 ( MQD522 ) or expressed either 3xHA::UNC-43 ( MQD530 ) or 3xFLAG::DAF-16 ( MQD89 ) under the control of own promoter . The 3xHA::UNC-43 protein was found in the immunoprecipitate of 3xFLAG::DAF-16 and vice versa ( Figure 4A\u2013B ) , suggesting that UNC-43 and DAF-16 can form a complex in vivo . Using purified recombinant proteins , we found that GST-UNC-43 but not GST or calmodulin ( CAM ) , was pulled down by nickel beads via 6xHis-DAF-16 ( Figure 4C ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 00518 . 010Figure 4 .

The transgenic strains are MQD522 ( co-expressing 3xHA::UNC-43 and 3xFLAG::DAF-16 ) , MQD530 ( expressing 3xHA::UNC-43 ) , and MQD89 ( expressing 3xFLAG::DAF-16 ) . ( C ) UNC-43 can directly bind to DAF-16 . Purified GST-UNC-43 but not CAM or the GST control was pulled down by Ni-NTA beads through its interaction with 6xHis-DAF-16 .

The Coomassie-stained gel is shown below the autoradiograph . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 00518 . 010 We then asked whether UNC-43 phosphorylates DAF-16 . We performed an in vitro kinase assay using purified GST-UNC-43 , Ca2+/CAM , and 6xHis-DAF-16 in the presence of [32P]-\u03b3-ATP . GST-UNC-43 readily phosphorylated DAF-16 in vitro ( Figure 4D ) . To map the phosphorylation site ( s ) , truncated DAF-16 proteins were used as kinase substrates . UNC-43 phosphorylated the DAF-16 N-F fragment ( 1\u2013267 aa ) but not the N-terminal fragment ( 1\u2013142 aa ) ( Figure 4E ) , suggesting that the phosphorylation site ( s ) resides in the region containing the forkhead domain ( 143\u2013267 aa ) and/or the C-terminal region ( 268\u2013508 aa ) . A mass spectrometry ( MS ) analysis of the full-length 6xHis-DAF-16 after the in vitro kinase reaction identified two DAF-16 residues T240 and S286 that were phosphorylated by UNC-43 ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1 , Figure 5A ) . T240 and S286 are among the predicted CAMKII sites ( RXXS/T or S/TXD ) . To confirm the MS result , we made two antibodies , one that specifically recognized phospho-T240 and one that specifically recognized phospho-S286 . Using these antibodies , we verified that DAF-16 was indeed phosphorylated by UNC-43 at T240 and S286 in vitro ( Figure 5B\u2013C ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 00518 . 011Figure 5 . UNC-43 phosphorylates S286 of DAF-16 , and TAX-6\u2022CNB-1 removes this modification .

DAF-16 phosphorylation was detected with antibodies specific for either phospho-T240 ( B ) or phospho-S286 ( C ) . ( D and E ) UNC-43 phosphorylates DAF-16 at S286 but not T240 in vivo . Phosphorylated DAF-16::6xHis::GFP was immunoprecipitated from unc-43 ( wt ) or unc-43 ( gf ) animals using antibodies specific for either phospho-S286 ( D ) or phospho-T240 ( E ) and visualized by blotting with an anti-GFP antibody . Transgenic strains expressing S286A or T240A DAF-16::6xHis::GFP served as negative controls . All strains carry the daf-16 null allele mu86 in the background . ( F ) TAX-6\u2022CNB-1 dephosphorylates DAF-16 specifically at S286 . Purified 6xHis-DAF-16 was phosphorylated by UNC-43 in vitro and then incubated with purified TAX-6\u2022GST-CNB-1 after heat inactivation of UNC-43 . Phospho-T240 , phospho-S286 , and total DAF-16 levels were assayed by western blotting .

Mass spectrum showing a DAF-16 peptide phosphorylated at T240 , one of the sites phosphorylated by UNC-43 in vitro . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 00518 . 012 To confirm whether DAF-16 is phosphorylated in vivo at both sites in an UNC-43-dependent manner , we immunoprecipitated phospho-DAF-16::6xHis::GFP from daf-16 ( null ) ;unc-43 ( gf ) or daf-16 ( null ) mutants using the phospho-DAF-16-specific antibodies and followed with anti-GFP immunoblotting . Interestingly , there was a marked increase of DAF-16 S286 phosphorylation , but not T240 phosphorylation , in the unc-43 ( gf ) mutant ( Figure 5D\u2013E ) . S286A and T240A mutations completely abolished phosphorylation on the respective sites ( Figure 5C\u2013E ) . We thus concluded that UNC-43 phosphorylates DAF-16 specifically on S286 . Apparently , T240 phosphorylation by UNC-43 does not occur in vivo under the tested condition . To test whether TAX-6 dephosphorylates DAF-16 at S286 , we phosphorylated recombinant DAF-16 in vitro with UNC-43 and then incubated it with purified TAX-6\u2022GST-CNB-1 . As shown in Figure 5F , phosphorylation of DAF-16 at S286 was dramatically reduced by TAX-6\u2022GST-CNB-1 , while phosphorylation of T240 remained unchanged . To validate the role of S286 in UNC-43- and TAX-6-regulated DAF-16 localization and longevity , we introduced the DAF-16 ( S286A ) ::6xHis::GFP transgene into daf-16 ( mu86 ) ;unc-43 ( gf ) and daf-16 ( mu86 ) ;tax-6 ( lf ) mutants . While DAF-16::6xHis::GFP accumulated in the nuclei of tax-6 ( lf ) and unc-43 ( gf ) mutants , DAF-16 ( S286A ) ::6xHis::GFP distributed diffusely throughout the cell in the same mutant backgrounds ( Figure 6A\u2013B ) , and the pattern resembled that of DAF-16::6xHis::GFP in WT worms ( Figure 1D ) . In C . elegans whose WT copy of DAF-16 was replaced by DAF-16 ( S286A ) , the lifespan extension by either unc-43 ( gf ) or tax-6 ( lf ) was greatly suppressed ( Figure 6C\u2013D , Figure 6\u2014source data 1A , B ) . Thus , the S286 residue is required for DAF-16-dependent effects of unc-43 ( gf ) and tax-6 ( lf ) , verifying that S286 is the regulatory site . In comparison , the constitutive nuclear localization phenotype of DAF-16 ( T240A ) contradicts with the idea that UNC-43 phosphorylates T240 to promote DAF-16 nuclear accumulation ( Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . Rather , it corroborates the observation that UNC-43 does not phosphorylate T240 in vivo ( Figure 5E ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 00518 . 013Figure 6 . Phosphorylation of DAF-16 at S286 induces the nuclear accumulation of DAF-16 and extends lifespan . The S286A mutation prevented DAF-16::6xHis::GFP from accumulating in the nucleus in unc-43 ( n498gf ) ( A ) or tax-6 ( ok2065 ) animals ( B ) . Unlike the DAF-16::6xHis::GFP transgene , DAF-16 ( S286A ) ::6xHis::GFP failed to restore the long lifespan in daf-16 ( mu86 ) ;unc-43 ( n498gf ) ( C ) or daf-16 ( mu86 ) ;tax-6 ( ok2065 ) mutants ( D ) . p<0 . 001 for unc-43 ( gf ) vs daf-16;unc-43 ( gf ) ;hqEx182 in ( C ) and tax-6 ( null ) vs . daf-16;tax-6 ( null ) ;hqEx221 in ( D ) . The S286D mutation caused DAF-16::6xHis::GFP to accumulate in the nucleus ( E ) and extended lifespan in the daf-16 ( mu86 ) background ( F ) . p<0 . 001 , daf-16;hqEx174/168 vs . daf-16;hqIs9 in ( F ) . 2 hr of heat stress at 28\u00b0C , 5 min of paraquat treatment , or 20 hr of food deprivation induced nuclear accumulation of DAF-16::6xHis::GFP in the WT animals but not the unc-43 ( n498n1186 ) mutants ( G ) .

UNC-43 does not phosphorylate T240 in vivo to promote DAF-16 nuclear accumulation . ( A ) DAF-16 ( T240A ) ::6xHis::GFP accumulated in the intestinal nuclei even in the absence unc-43 ( gf ) . This is incompatible with T240 being the UNC-43 phosphorylation site because mutating such a site to alanine was expected to inhibit DAF-16 nuclear accumulation . Rather , this result confirms that T240 is an AKT phosphorylation site ( Lin et al . , 2001 ) . ( B ) 80% of the worms expressing a GFP-tagged DAF-16 ( T240A-S286A ) mutant protein under a daf-16 promoter in the unc-43 ( n498 ) ;daf-16 ( mu86 ) background arrested as dauers , and the GFP signal was predominantly in the head neurons . A few individuals escaped dauer arrest and grew into adults . These animals displayed a strong nuclear accumulation of DAF-16 ( T240A-S286A ) in body-wall muscles and hypodermis but a weakened nuclear accumulation in the intestine compared to those expressing WT DAF-16 . In comparison , the S286A mutation prevented DAF-16 from accumulating in the nucleus when expressed in the same background ( Figure 6A ) . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 00518 . 01510 . 7554/eLife . 00518 . 016Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2 . Similar expression levels of DAF-16 ( S286D ) ::6xHis::GFP and DAF-16::6xHis::GFP in three strains used in Figure 6F . GFP fusion proteins in whole-worm lysates were quantified by anti-GFP WB . SDS-PAGE and anti-tubulin WB show equal loading of total proteins . For hqEx168 and hqEx174 , because the transgene arrays were not chromosomally integrated , GFP positive worms were hand-picked under the microscope and pooled to make lysates . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 00518 . 016 To mimic phosphorylation by UNC-43 , we mutated DAF-16 S286 to aspartic acid . When expressed in daf-16 ( mu86 ) animals , the DAF-16 ( S286D ) ::6xHis::GFP protein accumulated in the nucleus , whereas the WT DAF-16::6xHis::GFP protein was cytoplasmic , as expected ( Figure 6E ) . Moreover , the phosphomimetic of DAF-16 , but not the WT version , significantly increased the C . elegans lifespan in daf-16 ( null ) animals ( Figure 6F , Figure 6\u2014source data 1C ) . The effect was not due to higher protein amounts of DAF-16 ( S286D ) because DAF-16 ( S286D ) ::6xHis::GFP and DAF-16::6xHis::GFP were expressed at similar levels in these transgenic animals ( Figure 6E , Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . Taken together , the S286D mutation mimicked the effect of unc-43 ( gf ) and tax-6 ( lf ) on DAF-16 , whereas the S286A mutation of DAF-16 blocked the effects of unc-43 ( gf ) and tax-6 ( lf ) . Thus , phosphorylation of S286 is critical for CAMKII and Calcineurin to regulate DAF-16 localization and longevity . S286 is different from the known AKT phosphorylation sites ( T54 , S238 , T240 , and S312 for DAF-16b ) of DAF-16 ( Lin et al . , 2001 ) . Therefore , UNC-43 and TAX-6\u2022CNB-1 most likely respond to conditions that are distinct from the conditions sensed by AKT in the IIS pathway . In addition to mutations that reduce insulin signaling , various stress conditions , including thermal stress , oxidative stress , and starvation , can trigger translocation of DAF-16 to the nucleus ( Henderson and Johnson , 2001; Lin et al . , 2001 ) . Among the DAF-16 target genes are a wide range of stress response genes , including small heat shock proteins , a superoxide dismutase , catalases , and glutathione S-transferases ( Murphy et al . , 2003; Dong et al . , 2007 ) . Transcriptional activation of these target genes by nuclear DAF-16 helps the organism cope with stress , and daf-16 mutant worms survive stressful conditions less well than WT worms ( Wolff et al . , 2006 ) . To test whether UNC-43 is required for transmitting stress signals to DAF-16 , we crossed DAF-16::6xHis::GFP into unc-43 ( null ) and compared these animals to WT animals carrying the same transgene . At 20\u00b0C , DAF-16::6xHis::GFP displayed a cytoplasmic pattern in either WT or unc-43 ( null ) animals . When these worms were transferred to 28\u00b0C , DAF-16::6xHis::GFP accumulated in the nucleus in WT worms but remained cytoplasmic in unc-43 ( null ) animals ( Figure 6G ) . Similarly , starvation and paraquat , a chemical that generates reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) inside the cells , caused DAF-16 to translocate to the nucleus in WT but not unc-43 ( null ) worms ( Figure 6G ) . The results demonstrated that unc-43 is required for nuclear accumulation of DAF-16 in response to different types of stress . The site of DAF-16 that is phosphorylated by CAMKII is different from the site that is phosphorylated by AKT . Moreover , phosphorylation by AKT and CAMKII has opposite effects on DAF-16 activity ( Figures 5 and 6 and Lin et al . , 2001 ) . Thus , the IIS pathway ( DAF-2 ) and the CAMKII pathway might work in parallel . In agreement with this hypothesis , reduced IIS and increased phosphorylation of DAF-16 S286 , either by unc-43 ( gf ) or tax-6 ( lf ) , displayed an additive effect on lifespan ( Figure 7A\u2013B , Figure 7\u2014source data 1A ) . These two pathways , however , also seem to crosstalk . First , an unc-43 null allele shortened the daf-2 lifespan by 31% ( Figure 7C , Figure 7\u2014source data 1B ) , indicating that unc-43 is required for full lifespan extension by daf-2 ( e1370 ) . This result suggests that part of the signaling from DAF-2 is mediated by UNC-43 . However , phosphorylation of DAF-16 S286 seems nonessential for the longevity of daf-2 animals ( Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1 , Figure 7\u2014source data 1C ) , suggesting that an additional UNC-43 target ( s ) is involved in DAF-2 signaling . Second , in the constitutively active unc-43 ( gf ) mutant , which has increased phosphorylation on DAF-16 S286 ( Figure 5D ) , phosphorylation by AKT on T240 is greatly reduced ( Figure 5E ) . Therefore , in long-lived unc-43 ( gf ) animals , phosphorylation on these two residues appears to be coordinated , but it is unclear how this coordination occurs . The AKT kinase activity may be reduced in unc-43 ( gf ) , or phospho-S286 DAF-16 may be a poor substrate for AKT . In either case , dampened phosphorylation on the AKT site may be expected to prevent DAF-16 from forming a complex with the 14-3-3 protein , which has been shown to bind to and sequester AKT-phosphorylated FOXO ( DAF-16 or mammalian FOXO3 ) in the cytoplasm ( Brunet et al . , 1999; Berdichevsky et al . , 2006; Li et al . , 2007 ) . Consistently , we found that unc-43 ( gf ) reduced the amount of DAF-16-associated 14-3-3 without affecting the total amount of 14-3-3 ( Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . It remains to be seen whether S286 phosphorylation directly or indirectly promotes DAF-16 nuclear accumulation . 10 . 7554/eLife . 00518 . 017Figure 7 . The longevity of daf-2 mutants was partially suppressed by unc-43 ( null ) and further enhanced by unc-43 ( gf ) or tax-6 ( null ) . unc-43 ( n498 ) , a gain-of-function allele ( A ) , and tax-6 ( ok2065 ) , a null allele ( B ) , each extended lifespan in the WT background and further enhanced the longevity of daf-2 ( RNAi ) animals . ( C ) The daf-2 ( e1370 ) ;unc-43 ( n498n1186 ) double mutant lived a significantly shorter life than daf-2 ( e1370 ) , while the unc-43 ( n498n1186 ) mutant had a WT-like lifespan .

In the unc-43 ( n498gf ) mutant , in which DAF-16 accumulates in the nucleus , the amount of DAF-16/14-3-3 complex is reduced . DAF-16::6xHis::GFP was immunoprecipitated from worms carrying a WT or the gf allele of unc-43 . The amount of 14-3-3 present in the lysate and that associated with DAF-16::6xHis::GFP were visualized by WB using an antibody that recognizes both 14-3-3 proteins ( FTT-2 and PAR-5 ) in C . elegans . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 00518 . 020 While IIS and CAMKII/Calcineurin signaling act largely in parallel with each other , it is unclear what would happen if one pathway was in a state to inhibit DAF-16 while the other pathway was in a state that would activate it . To genetically mimic this scenario , we combined daf-2 RNAi with either unc-43 ( null ) or tax-6 ( jh107 ) , a constitutively active tax-6 ( gf ) allele in which the autoinhibitory domain was deleted ( Lee et al . , 2004 ) . DAF-16::GFP was cytoplasmic in unc-43 ( null ) or tax-6 ( gf ) , but nuclear DAF-16::GFP was clearly visible above the cytoplasmic background in daf-2 ( RNAi ) , daf-2 ( RNAi ) ;unc-43 ( null ) , or daf-2 ( RNAi ) ;tax-6 ( gf ) mutants ( Figure 8A ) . We also combined daf-18 RNAi , which enhances IIS to inhibit DAF-16 ( Ogg and Ruvkun , 1998 ) , with unc-43 ( gf ) or tax-6 ( lf ) , which activates DAF-16 . In both cases , the nuclear accumulation induced by unc-43 ( gf ) or tax-6 ( lf ) was greatly diminished by daf-18 RNAi ( Figure 8B ) . Therefore , under conditions in which there is a conflict between IIS and CAMKII/Calcineurin signaling toward DAF-16 , the insulin signaling pathway appears to dominate . 10 . 7554/eLife . 00518 . 021Figure 8 .

( C ) A model showing the regulation of DAF-16 ( FOXO ) by insulin signaling , UNC-43 ( CAMKII ) , and TAX-6\u2022CNB-1 ( Calcineurin ) . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 00518 . 021 Based on the experimental evidence above , we propose a model ( Figure 8C ) in which DAF-16 integrates hormonal signals and stress signals transmitted by the IIS pathway ( from DAF-2 to AKT ) and CAMKII ( UNC-43 ) , respectively . CAMKII and the counterbalancing phosphatase Calcineurin ( TAX-6\u2022CNB-1 ) act in parallel and coordinately with the IIS pathway to regulate DAF-16 activity . Sequence analysis of FOXO proteins revealed that DAF-16 S286 , the CAMKII phosphorylation site , is widely conserved in nematode species , zebra fish , frogs , mice , and humans ( Figure 9A ) . It is equivalent to S298 of mouse FOXO3 ( mFOXO3 ) and S299 of human FOXO3 ( hFOXO3 ) ( Figure 9A ) , and may be the equivalent of S303 of human FOXO1 or S300 of mouse FOXO1 ( not shown ) . Such conservation suggests that mammalian FOXO proteins are likely regulated by CAMKII and Calcineurin . 10 . 7554/eLife . 00518 . 022Figure 9 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 00518 . 025 To determine if this is true , we first expressed a FLAG-tagged mouse FOXO3 together with a GFP-tagged mouse CAMKII alpha ( CAMKIIA ) or beta ( CAMKIIB ) isoform , or a Myc-tagged human Calcineurin A ( CnA ) in HEK293T cells , and found that CAMKII and CnA both interact with FOXO3 ( Figure 9B\u2013C ) . Next , we asked whether CAMKII phosphorylates FOXO3 in vitro . Purified GST fusion proteins containing five non-overlapping fragments of FOXO3 ( Lehtinen et al . , 2006 ) were incubated with an active recombinant human CAMKIIA . CAMKIIA robustly phosphorylated the P2 and P3 fragments but not the others ( Figure 9D ) , placing the phosphorylation sites within aa 154\u2013409 . Mass spectrometry and mutagenesis studies of the full-length mFOXO3 or the P2 and P3 fragments from the in vitro kinase assay mapped the CAMKIIA phosphorylation sites to S252 , S279 , and S298 ( not shown ) . The same sites were also identified from FLAG-mFOXO3 co-expressed with CAMKIIA in HEK293T cells ( Figure 9E , Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . However , only mFOXO3 S298 , which corresponds to DAF-16 S286 , had a significant increase in phosphorylation when cells were co-transfected with CAMKIIA ( Figure 9F ) . This shows that S298 is the principle CAMKIIA phosphorylation site in vivo . S252 in mouse FOXO3 or S253 in human FOXO3 , the counterpart of DAF-16 T240 ( Figure 9A ) , is a highly conserved AKT phosphorylation site ( Brunet et al . , 1999 ) . Using a specific antibody , we found that neither CAMKIIA nor Calcineurin regulated phosphorylation of endogenous human FOXO3 at S253 in HEK293T cells ( Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . Moreover , Calcineurin can reduce the phosphorylation of the FOXO3-P3 fragment ( containing S298 ) by CAMKIIA , but not that of the P2 fragment ( containing S252 ) ( Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 3 ) . Taken together , these results demonstrate that mammalian CAMKII and Calcineurin regulate phosphorylation of FOXO3 at the same conserved site as in C . elegans ( S298 in mouse FOXO3 and S286 in DAF-16 ) . A recent study by Ozcan et al . shows that four non-AKT phosphorylation sites are involved in the activation of murine FOXO1 by CAMKII\u03b3 , likely through the p38 MAP kinase , in glucagon-stimulated hepatocytes ( Ozcan et al . , 2012 ) . Serine 300 of mouse FOXO1 , the equivalent of S298 of mouse FOXO3 , is not among them ( S246 , S295 , S467 , and S475 ) . To find out whether the CAMKIIA isoform phosphorylates FOXO1 in the same way as it does FOXO3 , we expressed a FLAG-tagged human FOXO1 in HEK293T cells co-transfected or not with CAMKIIA . Mass spectrometry analysis identified three CAMKIIA-regulated phosphorylation sites equivalent to mouse FOXO1 S295 , S467 , and S475 ( not shown ) . This agrees with the findings by Ozcan et al . and suggests that CAMKII directly phosphorylates FOXO3 but not FOXO1 in mammals . Lastly , we determined whether CAMKII and Calcineurin regulate the transcriptional activity of FOXO3 . Mammalian CAMKII can be activated by autophosphorylation at threonine 286 ( Mukherji et al . , 1994; Rich and Schulman , 1998 ) . Mutation of this residue to A or D results in a kinase dead or constitutively active form of CAMKII , respectively ( Fong et al . , 1989 ) . Using a luciferase reporter assay , we found that the transcriptional activity of FOXO3 was indeed stimulated by CAMKIIA in a way that required S298 of FOXO3 ( Figure 10A ) and T286 of CAMKIIA ( Figure 10B ) , and further enhanced by the constitutively active CAMKIIA mutant ( Figure 10C ) . Consistently , expression of Calcineurin significantly inhibited the transcriptional activity of FOXO3 ( Figure 10D ) . From these results , we conclude that CAMKIIA and Calcineurin oppose each other in regulating the transcriptional activity of mouse FOXO3 through phosphorylation or dephosphorylation at S298 . This mechanism is conserved from C . elegans to mammals . 10 . 7554/eLife . 00518 . 026Figure 10 . CAMKII and Calcineurin regulate the transcriptional activity of FOXO3 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 00518 . 026 \n Our data suggest that CAMKII ( UNC-43 ) and Calcineurin ( TAX-6\u2022CNB-1 ) , by phosphorylating or de-phosphorylating serine 286 of DAF-16 , extend or shorten the lifespan of C . elegans . The direct , antagonistic nature of these two enzymes also raised an interesting possibility that , with their opposing effects on DAF-16 and a common activating signal ( Ca2+/CAM ) , UNC-43 and TAX-6\u2022CNB-1 would constitutively negate each other and have essentially no control of DAF-16 . However , this outcome most likely does not occur because of the difference in the spatial distribution and temporal activation profiles of the two enzymes . TAX-6 and CNB-1 , similar to DAF-16 , are expressed in most cells in C . elegans ( Ogg et al . , 1997; Bandyopadhyay et al . , 2002; Kuhara et al . , 2002; Dong et al . , 2007 ) . In contrast , unc-43 promoter-driven GFP was only detected in neurons and the intestine ( Hunt-Newbury et al . , 2007 ) . We also detected UNC-43 primarily in the nervous system ( not shown ) . At the subcellular level , the TAX-6::GFP fusion protein is distributed diffusely throughout the cytoplasm and inside the nucleus ( Kuhara et al . , 2002; Dong et al . , 2007 ) . In contrast , the CFP::UNC-43 fusion protein is concentrated on perinuclear structures and clusters in neurites ( Umemura et al . , 2005 ) . Temporally , Ca2+-activated CAMKII phosphorylates another molecule of CAMKII at T286 to convert it to a Ca2+/CAM-independent kinase , prolonging the kinase activity after the initial activation ( Erickson et al . , 2011 ) . CAMKII can also be activated by ROS at low Ca2+ concentrations ( Erickson et al . , 2011 ) . In mammalian cells , inhibition of Calcineurin by cytoplasmic CAMKII and inhibition of CAMKII by Calcineurin have both been reported ( MacDonnell et al . , 2009; Kubokawa et al . , 2011 ) , suggesting that the balance is intricately maintained . Therefore , in the case of the simultaneous activation of CAMKII and Calcineurin by Ca2+/CAM , either the kinase or the phosphatase could dominate the regulation of DAF-16 either locally ( e . g . , cytoplasm vs nucleus ) or for certain time windows . This balance likely fine-tunes the DAF-16 activity in response to a changing environment . It is likely that UNC-43/Calcineurin is responsible for activating DAF-16 when worms experience a variety of stress signals , including heat stress , oxidative stress , or prolonged starvation ( Figure 6G ) . Food deprivation acts through UNC-43 to suppress spontaneous sex-muscle contraction in C . elegans males ( LeBoeuf et al . , 2007 ) . Reported in HEK293T cells , human FOXO3 is phosphorylated at non-AKT sites under stress conditions such as heat shock or H2O2 treatment ( Brunet et al . , 2004 ) . ROS-induced oxidation of two methionine residues activates CAMKII , and this activation can occur under conditions of low Ca2+ ( Erickson et al . , 2011 ) . Thus , CAMKII is perfectly equipped to transmit ROS signaling and calcium signaling , and phosphorylation of FOXO3 by CAMKII may play a highly conserved role in the stress response , from worms to humans . To date , DAF-16 is the only biochemically and genetically proven substrate of TAX-6\u2022CNB-1 , but it is not the only substrate involved in lifespan regulation by Calcineurin . Inactivation of CRTC-1 , a coactivator of CREB , contributes to the longevity of tax-6 ( lf ) animals ( Mair et al . , 2011 ) . Hence , CRTC-1 is an excellent candidate , although it has not been shown that TAX-6\u2022CNB-1 directly dephosphorylates CRTC-1 . There may be additional substrates . Regardless , the discoveries made thus far jointly provide a good explanation for the large but incomplete suppression of tax-6 ( lf ) longevity by daf-16 ( null ) ( Dong et al . , 2007 ) . Post-transplant new-onset diabetes mellitus ( NODM ) is a frequent and serious complication for organ transplant patients . One of the NODM risk factors is the use of Calcineurin inhibitors , such as cyclosporin A and FK506 , which suppress immune-rejection of donor organs ( Heisel et al . , 2004 ) . In light of this work , we propose that sustained activation of FOXO3 resulting from chronic inhibition of Calcineurin may cause NODM in transplant patients . Given the conservation and broad tissue distribution of CAMKII , Calcineurin , and FOXO3 , the regulatory mechanism uncovered in this study likely plays a role in many physiological functions . \n All strains were cultured at 20\u00b0C following standard protocols unless otherwise indicated ( Brenner , 1974 ) . Double mutants were made using standard genetic methods , and the genotypes were confirmed using PCR or PCR followed by sequencing . The strains and oligos used in the study are listed in Supplementary file 1A , B , respectively . The following antibodies were purchased: Mouse anti-Actin ( Sigma-Aldrich , St Louis , MO ) , Mouse anti-tubulin ( Sigma-Aldrich ) , mouse anti-CAM ( Millipore , Billerica , MA ) , mouse anti-FLAG ( Sigma-Aldrich ) , anti-FLAG M2 Affinity Gel ( Sigma-Aldrich ) , rabbit anti-GFP ( Abmart , Shanghai , China ) , mouse anti-GFP ( Roche , Basel , Switzerland ) , rabbit anti-GFP ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) , rabbit anti-GST ( GeneSci , Beijing , China ) , monoclonal anti-HA agarose ( Sigma-Aldrich ) , rabbit anti-mFOXO3 ( phospho-S252 ) /hFOXO3 ( phospho-S253 ) ( Cell Signaling , Danvers , MA ) , Mouse anti-Myc ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Dallas , TX ) , goat anti-mouse IgG HRP ( Jackson Immuno Research , West Grove , PA ) , and goat anti-rabbit IgG HRP ( BaiHuiZhongYuan , Beijing , China ) . Rabbit \u03b1-HA and monoclonal mouse \u03b1-DAF-16 antibodies were made at the antibody center of the NIBS , Beijing . A single-chain anti-GFP antibody was produced as described before ( Kubala et al . , 2010 ) and cross-linked to NHS-activated Sepharose 4 Fast Flow beads ( GE Healthcare , Piscataway Township , NJ ) . We called this GBP beads . To produce the DAF-16 antibody , full-length DAF-16b was cloned into the His-tag vector pET-28a , expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 , and purified by Ni-NTA resin ( Qiagen ) . Rabbit \u03b1-DAF-16b ( pT240 ) and \u03b1-DAF-16b ( pS286 ) antibodies were custom made and affinity purified at Abmart ( Shanghai , China ) using the synthetic DAF-16 phospho-peptides \u2018RERSN ( pT ) IETTT-C\u2019 and \u2018SIQTI ( pS ) HDLYD-C , \u2019 respectively . A Rabbit polyclonal anti-human 14-3-3 antibody that recognizes both C . elegans 14-3-3 proteins was a gift from Dr Yamei Wang ( Xiamen University , China ) . The daf-16 constructs were subcloned and further modified from a Pdaf-16::daf-16b::gfp construct described previously ( the daf-16b isoform used to be called daf-16a2 ) ( Henderson and Johnson , 2001 ) . The GST-CNB-1 and TAX-6 bacterial expression constructs were modified from the GST-CNB-1 and GST-TAX-6 plasmids reported before ( Bandyopadhyay et al . , 2002 ) . The unc-43 expression constructs were made from unc-43 cDNAs that were amplified from a C . elegans cDNA library . The constructs expressing full-length or truncated mouse FOXO3 have been described ( Lehtinen et al . , 2006 ) , and the FOXO3-P2-S252A mutant was made by site-directed mutagenesis . The CAMKIIA and CAMKIIB expression constructs have described ( Gaudilli\u00e8re et al . , 2004 ) . The Myc-CnA and Myc-CnB expression constructs under the CMV promoter were subcloned from \u2018pET15b CnA CnB\u2019 ( Addgene ) . The FKRE-luciferase expression vector was kindly provided by Dr Azad Bonni ( Harvard Medical School ) . GST-CNB-1 and TAX-6 were co-expressed in E . coli BL21 and affinity purified using glutathione Sepharose ( GE Healthcare ) in PBS containing 0 . 5% NP-40 following standard protocols . GST-DAF-16 ( N ) and GST-DAF-16 ( N-F ) were purified in the same manner . Recombinant GST-UNC-43 was purified as described above but using a buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl , pH 7 . 6 , 150 mM NaCl , 0 . 5% NP-40 . Recombinant 6xHis-DAF-16 and 6xHis-DAF-16-6AM were expressed in BL21 and affinity purified using Ni-NTA agarose resin ( Qiagen ) in buffer containing 20 mM HEPES , pH 7 . 5 , 150 mM NaCl , and 0 . 5% NP-40 . His-tagged proteins were eluted off beads by adding 250 or 500 mM imidazole to the buffer after a 30 mM imidazole wash . Eluted proteins underwent buffer exchange and were concentrated using Centricon purifying units ( Millipore ) with 10-kDa ( for TAX\u2022GST-CNB-1 ) or 50-kDa ( for other proteins ) cutoffs to 0 . 5\u20131 . 0 mg/ml protein in storage buffer ( 20 mM HEPES , pH 7 . 5 , 150 mM NaCl , 0 . 5% NP-40 , 10% glycerol ) ; the resulting solutions contained >1 mM glutathione or >5 mM imidazole . Bovine Calmodulin and human Calcineurin were purchased from Merck . Active human GST-CAMKIIA was ordered from Sigma . Recombinant mFOXO3 P1-P5 fragments were purified as described ( Lehtinen et al . , 2006 ) . Lifespan assays were carried out at 20\u00b0C unless otherwise indicated . To synchronize worms , twenty adult worms were allowed to lay eggs on NGM plates for 4 hr before being removed . After the progeny grew to the L4 stage , they were transferred to new plates ( 10 worms/plate ) . At least ten plates ( 100 worms ) were used for the lifespan assay of each strain or RNAi treatment . Worms were transferred to fresh plates every 2 days until they ceased laying egg , after which worms were transferred to fresh plates every week . For lifespan assays that involved or would be compared with the unc-43 ( gf ) mutant , 50 \u03bcg/ml FUDR was added to the plates to prevent its Egl ( egg-laying defective ) phenotype from interfering with lifespan measurement . In these experiments ( Figure 2\u2014source data 1B; Figure 2\u2014source data 1C; Figure 3\u2014source data 1; Figure 6\u2014source data 1A; Figure 6\u2014source data 1C; Figure 7\u2014source data 1A ) , worms were transferred to fresh plates every 4 days until death . Live worms were scored every 2 days . Worms were considered dead if they failed to respond to gentle touches with a worm pick on the head and tail . Worms that had internally hatched larvae ( \u2018bagged\u2019 ) or ruptured vulvae ( \u2018exploded\u2019 ) or crawled off the agar surface were censored . SPSS ( Statistical Package for the Social Sciences ) software was used for the statistical analysis of the lifespan data , and the log-rank method was used to calculate p values . RNAi assays were performed at 20\u00b0C using the feeding method as previously described ( Kamath et al . , 2003 ) . Worms were fed RNAi bacteria from the time of hatching unless otherwise indicated . E . coli HT115 ( DE3 ) transformed with pAD12 , an empty RNAi vector ( Arantes-Oliveira et al . , 2002 ) , was used as a control . pTL13 is an RNAi construct targeting unc-43 , which we generated by inserting a 332-bp cDNA fragment of unc-43 into the multiple cloning sites of pAD12 . The other RNAi bacterial strains were obtained from the Ahringer RNAi library . To examine the interaction between DAF-16 and TAX-6 , 6xHis-DAF-16 was incubated with purified TAX-6\u2022GST-CNB-1 complex in the presence of 2 \u03bcg CAM and 30 \u03bcl pre-washed Ni-NTA agarose resin ( Qiagen ) in binding buffer A ( 50 mM Tris , pH 8 . 0 , 100 mM NaCl , 4 mM CaCl2 , 2 mM MgCl2 , 0 . 5% NP-40 ) at 4\u00b0C for 2 hr . The beads were then washed with washing buffer A ( 50 mM Tris , pH 8 . 0 , 100 mM NaCl , 4 mM CaCl2 , 2 mM MgCl2 , 0 . 5% NP-40 , 30 mM imidazole ) and eluted with SDS loading buffer . Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie blue . For DAF-16 and UNC-43 binding , 6xHis-DAF-16 was incubated with purified GST-UNC-43 and CAM in the presence of 30 \u03bcl pre-washed Ni-NTA agarose in binding buffer A without MgCl2 . After binding , beads were washed with washing buffer A without MgCl2 and eluted with SDS loading buffer . The samples were resolved by replicate SDS-PAGE gels , one for Coomassie blue or silver staining , and the other for western blots with anti-GST , anti-DAF-16 or anti-CAM antibodies . To map the TAX-6 binding site on DAF-16 , 5 \u00b5g of GST or GST-tagged DAF-16 fragments were incubated with TAX-6::GFP-containing worm lysate ( \u223c15 \u00b5g/\u00b5l proteins in 300 \u03bcl of 20 mM Tris , pH 8 . 0 , 1% NP-40 , 10% glycerol , 1x Protease Inhibitor Cocktail , EDTA free , Roche ) and pre-washed glutathione beads at 4\u00b0C for 1 hr . The beads were washed three times and eluted with 1x SDS loading buffer . Mixed-stage worms were cultured at 20\u00b0C on five 100-mm HG plates seeded with OP50 , harvested , and washed with M9 buffer to yield 200\u2013500 \u03bcl of packed worms . Then , 200 \u03bcl of packed worms was mixed with 200 \u03bcl of 2x lysis buffer A , B , or C ( see below ) and 800 \u03bcl of 0 . 5-mm diameter glass beads . The mixture was lysed using FastPrep-24 ( MP Biomedicals ) at 6 . 5 m/s , 20 s/pulse \u00d7 3 pulses with 5-min intervals on ice . Worm lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 13 , 000 rpm for 30 min . For anti-GFP and anti-FLAG IPs , the supernatant was incubated with GBP beads or anti-FLAG M2 beads for 1\u20132 hr . For the phospho-DAF-16 IP , the supernatant was incubated with 10 \u03bcl of the antibody specific for DAF-16 ( pT240 ) or DAF-16 ( pS298 ) and 30 \u03bcl of pre-washed protein A and protein G beads ( mixed at 1:1 ) for 2 hr . After incubation with the lysates , the beads were washed 2\u20133 times with 1x lysis buffer , 5 min each time , and boiled in 2x SDS loading buffer for western blot analysis . All steps , from making the lysates to eluting the beads , were performed at 4\u00b0C . 1x lysis buffer A ( for IP of DAF-16 and TAX-6 ) : 20 mM Tris pH 8 . 0 , 1% NP-40 , 10% glycerol , 2 mM EDTA , 1x PIC ( Protease Inhibitor Cocktail , EDTA free; Roche ) . 1x lysis buffer B ( for IP of DAF-16 and UNC-43 ) : 50 mM Tris , pH 8 . 0 , 150 mM NaCl , 0 . 1% NP-40 , 10% glycerol , 1x PIC , 1x PhosSTOP ( Roche ) . 1x lysis buffer C ( for IP of phospho-DAF-16 ) : 50 mM Tris , pH 7 . 6 , 150 mM NaCl , 0 . 1% SDS , 0 . 25% sodium deoxycholate , 1% NP-40 , 2 mM EDTA , 1x PIC , 1x PhosSTOP . Immunoprecipitation of FLAG-FOXO3 from HEK293T cells was performed as described ( Xie et al . , 2012 ) . 2 \u03bcg of purified recombinant GST-UNC-43 ( or 5 \u03bcg of purified active human GST-CAMKIIA ) was incubated with 2 \u03bcg of CAM and 2\u20135 \u03bcg of purified 6xHis- or GST-tagged DAF-16 ( or GST-FOXO3 ) in the kinase reaction buffer ( 50 mM PIPES , pH 7 . 0 , 10 mM MgCl2 , 4 mM CaCl2 , 100 \u03bcM ATP , 1x PIC ) in the presence or absence of [32P]-\u03b3-ATP at 30\u00b0C for 15 min . Proteins were resolved by SDS PAGE and analyzed by autoradiography or WB with anti-DAF-16 ( pT240 ) or anti-DAF-16 ( pS286 ) antibodies . The kinase reactions , performed as described above , were shifted to 60\u00b0C for 10 min to inactivate UNC-43 or CAMKIIA . Then the samples were incubated or not with 5 \u03bcg of TAX-6\u2022GST-CNB-1 or Calcineurin in phosphatase buffer ( 50 mM Tris , pH 7 . 5 , 100 mM NaCl , 6 mM MgCl2 , 1 mM CaCl2 , 1x PIC ) in the presence of 2 \u03bcg CAM at 30\u00b0C for 30 min . The sample were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by autoradiography or by WB with antibodies specific for DAF-16 ( pT240 ) , DAF-16 ( pS286 ) , or mFOXO3 ( S252 ) /hFOXO3 ( S253 ) . Worms were cultured at 20\u00b0C on NGM plates from eggs laid within a 4-hr period and imaged at the L4 stage unless otherwise indicated . As soon as worms were removed from incubation , they were mounted on slides and imaged immediately . For the starvation challenge , approximately 100 L4 worms were placed on an empty plate and kept at 20\u00b0C for 20 hr before imaging . For the heat stress challenge , well-fed L4 worms on bacterial food were shifted to 28\u00b0C for 2 hr . Parallel samples were maintained at 20\u00b0C on food as controls . All GFP and DIC images were taken using a Zeiss Axio Imager M1 microscope at 400-fold magnification . Coomassie blue-stained bands corresponding to in vitro phosphorylated DAF-16 or FOXO3 fragments , or FLAG-FOXO3 immunoprecipetated from 293T cells were destained and in-gel digested with trypsin . LC-MS/MS analyses of the resulting peptides were carried out on an LTQ-Orbitrap ( ThermoFisher Scientific ) or LTQ-Orbitrap Velos ( ThermoFisher Scientific ) as described before with slight modifications ( Li et al . , 2011 ) . CID MS2 with neutral-loss triggered MS3 spectra were collected on LTQ-Orbitrap and HCD MS2 spectra were collected on LTQ-Orbitrap Velos . The MS2 or MS3 data were searched against the C . elegans protein database ( for DAF-16 ) or the NCBI mouse protein database ( for FOXO3 ) . The pLabel software was used for spectral labeling ( Yang et al . , 2012 ) . HEK293T cells were maintained in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) at 5% CO2 . Transfection was carried out using Lipofectamine 2000 ( Invitrogen ) , and the luciferase assays were carried out using the Dual-Luciferase assay kit ( Promega ) .", "headings": ["Abstract", "Introduction", "Results", "Discussion", "Materials and methods"], "keywords": ["developmental biology", "biochemistry and chemical biology"], "id": "elife-00518-v1"}
{"lay_summary": "Anyone who has ever lived with a cat is familiar with its grooming behavior . This innate behavior follows a particular sequence as the cat methodically cleans its body parts one-by-one . Many animals also have grooming habits , even insects such as fruit flies . The fact that grooming sequences are seen across such different species suggests that this behavior is important for survival . Nevertheless , how the brain organizes grooming sequences , or other behaviors that involve a sequence of tasks , is not well understood . Fruit flies make a good model for studying grooming behavior for a couple of reasons . First , they are fastidious cleaners . When coated with dust they will faithfully carry out a series of cleaning tasks to clean each body part . Second , there are many genetic tools and techniques that researchers can use to manipulate the fruit flies' behaviors . One technique allows specific brain cells to be targeted and activated to trigger particular behaviors . Seeds et al . used these sophisticated techniques , computer modeling , and behavioral observations to uncover how the brains of fruit flies orchestrate a grooming sequence . Dust-covered flies follow a predictable sequence of cleaning tasks: beginning by using their front legs to clean their eyes , they then clean their antennae and head . This likely helps to protect their sensory organs . Next , they move on to the abdomen , possibly to ensure that dust doesn't interfere with their ability to breathe . Wings and thorax follow last . Periodically , the flies stop to rub their legs together to remove any accumulated dust before resuming the cleaning sequence . Seeds et al . activated different sets of brain cells one-by-one to see if they could trigger a particular grooming task and found that individual cleaning tasks could be triggered , in the absence of dust , by stimulating a specific group of brain cells . This suggests each cleaning task is a discrete behavior controlled by a subset of cells . Then Seeds et al . tried to stimulate more than one cleaning behavior at a time; they discovered that wing-cleaning suppressed thorax-cleaning , abdomen-cleaning suppressed both of these , and head-cleaning suppressed all the others . This suggests that a \u2018hierarchy\u2019 exists in the brain that exactly matches the sequence that flies normally follow as they clean their body parts . By learning more about how the brain coordinates grooming sequences , the findings of Seeds et al . may also provide insights into other behaviors that involve a sequence of tasks , such as nest building in animals or typing in humans . Following on from this work , one of the next challenges will be to see if such behaviors also use a \u2018suppression hierarchy\u2019 to ensure that individual tasks are carried out in the right order .", "article": "Motor sequences are formed through the serial execution of different movements , but how nervous systems implement this process remains largely unknown . We determined the organizational principles governing how dirty fruit flies groom their bodies with sequential movements . Using genetically targeted activation of neural subsets , we drove distinct motor programs that clean individual body parts . This enabled competition experiments revealing that the motor programs are organized into a suppression hierarchy; motor programs that occur first suppress those that occur later . Cleaning one body part reduces the sensory drive to its motor program , which relieves suppression of the next movement , allowing the grooming sequence to progress down the hierarchy . A model featuring independently evoked cleaning movements activated in parallel , but selected serially through hierarchical suppression , was successful in reproducing the grooming sequence . This provides the first example of an innate motor sequence implemented by the prevailing model for generating human action sequences . \n Animals engage in a variety of complex serial behaviors that are essential for survival , such as nest building , communication , courtship , and prey capture . Serial behaviors can be subdivided into distinct motor actions that are mutually exclusive and often proceed in a given sequence ( Gallistel , 1980; Adams , 1984 ) . While our understanding of how motor actions are produced expands ( Marder et al . , 2005; Bizzi and Cheung , 2008; Grillner and Jessell , 2009; Costa , 2011 ) , less is known about the rules that govern how nervous systems assemble individual actions into coordinated sequential behaviors . There are two main hypotheses about mechanisms that drive the sequential progression of actions during serial behavior . One hypothesis suggests that each action in a series triggers performance of the next action ( James , 1890; Adams , 1984 ) . This is one of the earliest views of motor sequencing and is thought to underlie some sequential behaviors , such as bird song ( Long et al . , 2010 ) . An alternative hypothesis proposes that the premotor units of all actions in a sequence are activated or readied in parallel and then sequentially selected through winner-take-all competition ( Lashley , 1951; Houghton and Hartley , 1995; Bullock , 2004 ) . This model was originally proposed based on human psychology experiments demonstrating a parallel representation of letter typing acts prior to the typing of a word . Electrophysiological evidence in primates is consistent with this parallel model of serial behavior ( Averbeck et al . , 2002; Mushiake et al . , 2006 ) . However , it has been difficult to causatively confirm the model and determine its underlying action selection mechanisms . One strategy for testing how serial behavior is executed is to first identify the individual motor actions that make up the behavior and to then use neural control over each action to investigate how its manipulation affects the progression of the other actions in the series . Independent control of each action in a sequence is challenging to achieve in most systems . However , recent tool development in Drosophila melanogaster permits subdivisions of behavior to be identified and manipulated in freely moving flies by expressing neural activators in subsets of neurons in the brain . This approach has revealed that acute neural activation can trigger specific behaviors and subcomponents of behaviors , such as abdominal bending and courtship song ( two subcomponents of the courtship sequence ) ( Clyne and Miesenb\u00f6ck , 2008; von Philipsborn et al . , 2011; Flood et al . , 2013 ) . While these tools have invigorated interest in identifying the neurons that drive behavior , they also enable experiments to probe the organization of serial behavior through specific control of individual motor actions . Here , we study the organizational principles underlying the neural control of serial action selection in an innate behavior common to most limbed animals\u2014grooming ( Sachs , 1988 ) . Grooming consists of discrete cleaning movements that occur in predictable sequences; however , the mechanisms that govern transitions between the movements are not known ( Szebenyi , 1969; Fentress and Stilwell , 1973; Dawkins and Dawkins , 1976; Sachs , 1988 ) . Local mechanical stimulation of a body part causes fruit flies to perform precisely targeted cleaning sweeps with their front or hind legs towards that body part ( Vandervorst and Ghysen , 1980; Corfas and Dudai , 1989 ) . In contrast , when they are completely coated in dust , flies coordinate a repertoire of cleaning movements to groom their whole bodies ( Figure 1A; Bentley , 1975; Phillis et al . , 1993 ) . We reasoned that we could exploit the behavior of such dust-coated flies to determine how different grooming actions are prioritized and ordered when they are stimulated at the same time . We show that dust on the body elicits different independently evoked cleaning motor programs for five body parts that progress in series . By genetically targeting different neural subsets , we gain experimental control over each cleaning motor program to demonstrate that they are organized into a suppression hierarchy . We next generate an empirically derived computational model that demonstrates how a suppression hierarchy can mediate the sequential selection of the cleaning motor programs . This work reveals how the organization of Drosophila grooming is well described by a parallel model of serial behavior . 10 . 7554/eLife . 02951 . 003Figure 1 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 02951 . 009 \n We tested whether flies would prioritize cleaning of specific body parts when they were completely dirty . This was achieved by coating flies in dust , paired with measurements of changing dust distributions on the body surface ( Figure 1B , C , Figure 1\u2014figure supplements 1 and 2 ) and manual annotation of their cleaning movements ( Figure 1E; Video 1 ) . In response to dust on their bodies , flies groomed with a predictable progression of targeted cleaning movements ( Figure 1D\u2013F , Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3 , Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4B , C ) . This progression required dust , as undusted flies did not groom in a sequential progression ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4A , C ) . Dusted flies rapidly cleaned their eyes and then focused on the antennae , demonstrating that they sequentially clean specific regions on the head ( Figure 1D ) . They next cleaned their posterior body parts in the order from abdomen to wings to thorax . The grooming progression occurred as a sequence in which the probabilities of cleaning different regions of the body gradually changed through time . That is , the progression was not absolutely unidirectional as flies returned to cleaning earlier body parts even though they had already started cleaning later body parts ( referred to as return cleaning ) ( Figure 1E , Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4B , example ethograms ) . As the flies progressed through the grooming sequence , each bout of body part cleaning featured cyclic transitions between sweeps of the targeted region and rubbing of the legs against each other ( Figure 1G , Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 5; Video 1 ) . These cyclic bouts of leg rubbing likely occurred when the legs accumulated sufficient dust from sweeping the body , which was then rubbed towards the distal leg parts and removed . Grooming of the entire body did not necessarily proceed as a continuous process . Flies often paused to walk around and then resumed cleaning where they left off or transitioned to other body parts ( Figure 1G ) . Thus , flies groom by gradually cleaning different body parts in bouts that are characterized by cyclic transitions between body cleaning sweeps and leg rubbing ( shown as a series of transition diagrams in Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 6 ) . The priority order for cleaning the different body parts is: eyes > antennae > abdomen > wings > thorax . 10 . 7554/eLife . 02951 . 010Video 1 . Cleaning movements of a wild-type fly after being coated in dust . This video is related to Figure 1 . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 02951 . 010 The modularity of grooming is evident from observations that individual cleaning movements can be evoked by locally applied stimuli ( Vandervorst and Ghysen , 1980; Corfas and Dudai , 1989 ) . This led us to ask whether grooming movements are modular enough to be activated independently in the brain . We expressed the temperature-sensitive cation channel dTrpA1 ( UAS-dTrpA1 ) ( Hamada et al . , 2008 ) in different enhancer-driven GAL4 expression patterns in the nervous system ( Jenett et al . , 2012 ) and screened for grooming phenotypes ( see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019 for details ) . Using this method to activate neurons targeted by different GAL4 lines , we discovered that grooming movements could indeed be independently activated in the absence of dust . We identified different GAL4 lines that caused exclusive cleaning of each body part , including the head , abdomen , wings , and legs ( Figure 2 , Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1 , Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2; see Video 2 , Video 3 , Video 4 , Video 5 , Video 6 , Video 7 , Video 8 , and Video 9 for representative videos and more detail regarding the behavioral phenotypes ) . Some lines we identified drove cleaning of different body subparts such as the antennae , in agreement with our observations that flies precisely target cleaning of different regions of the head ( Figure 2 , R26B12 ) . Although these lines were sufficient for driving highly specific cleaning movements , we did not find evidence that blocking the activity of their targeted neurons could disrupt dust-induced grooming ( tested using the neural inhibitors UAS-Shibirets1 or UAS-TNT , data not shown ) . This suggests that the targeted neurons are sufficient but not necessary for driving their respective cleaning movements . All lines tested could activate continuous cleaning of their corresponding body parts for long periods of time ( at least 25 min ) . Thus , grooming can be decomposed into specific motor programs ( hereafter referred to as cleaning modules ) that can be independently activated by subsets of neurons . Experimental induction of these cleaning modules via GAL4-expressed dTrpA1 allowed us to directly test how they are sequentially executed during the progression of grooming . 10 . 7554/eLife . 02951 . 011Figure 2 . Activation of UAS-dTrpA1 in different GAL4 lines is sufficient to activate discrete cleaning movements in the absence of dust . Cleaning movement activation phenotypes driven by 12 GAL4 lines expressing UAS-dTrpA1 . Flies ( including controls ) were warmed to 30\u00b0C to activate the targeted neurons while their cleaning movements were recorded and manually scored ( n = 10 flies/GAL4 line; 130 flies total ) . Ethograms of the scored behaviors are displayed by compressing all mutually exclusive events to a single line per fly . Colors below the movement names correspond to those on the ethograms . White space in each ethogram represents the time flies spent walking or standing in place . The GAL4 lines are grouped into four cleaning movement categories: head , abdomen , thorax and/or wings , and legs . The grid displays increases and decreases from control flies in the fraction of time each line spent performing different cleaning movements . Grid heat map represents the p-values for the comparisons of the different GAL4 lines and control flies ( Kruskal\u2013Wallis followed by Mann\u2013Whitney U pairwise tests and Bonferroni correction ) . Note: R71C07 displays significant increases in both abdominal cleaning and leg rubbing . Although this line is shown in the abdominal cleaning category , it could also be included with leg rubbing .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 02951 . 021 We postulated that coating flies with dust leads to the simultaneous stimulation of all the cleaning modules , but because of body mechanical constraints , these competing modules are mutually exclusive and therefore must be performed one at a time . Such temporal conflicts between competing behaviors can be resolved if the performance of one behavior suppresses the others , such that only one is selected at a time ( Davis , 1979; Redgrave et al . , 1999; Kupfermann and Weiss , 2001; Kristan , 2008 ) . Building on this concept , we hypothesized that asymmetries in intermodular suppression could underlie biases in the preferred order of execution . Specifically , we hypothesized that a suppression hierarchy between cleaning modules could mediate fly grooming priorities . In this schema , the ability of the cleaning modules to suppress each other forms a hierarchy in which modules \u2018higher\u2019 in the hierarchy are able to suppress \u2018lower\u2019 modules , but not vice-versa . For this hypothesis to account for the fly grooming progression , the order of suppression within the hierarchy would have to match the order of the normal grooming sequence , as schematized ( Figure 3A ) . Thus , in a completely dusted fly , the most hierarchically superior module is able to suppress all the other competing modules , the second highest module can suppress all but the first one , and so on . 10 . 7554/eLife . 02951 . 022Figure 3 . Hierarchical suppression and dust stimulus drive cleaning movement selection . Cleaning of specific body parts was artificially activated while flies were dusted to stimulate competition between their cleaning movements . Flies were pre-warmed at 30\u00b0C such that the dTrpA1-induced cleaning module was active at the time of dusting . After grooming for 25 min , flies were anesthetized and their dust patterns were measured . ( A ) Grid showing the expected suppression pattern if the hierarchical suppression hypothesis is true . Modules are arranged on the grid in the order that they occur in the normal grooming sequence . ( B ) The observed suppression hierarchy . For each line , the normalized fraction of dust remaining on different regions of the flies is mapped onto the corresponding grid locations ( n \u2265 26 per body part , \u2018Materials and methods\u2019 ) .

Behaviors of flies that were coated in dust while specific cleaning movements were artificially activated . Flies were pre-warmed at 30\u00b0C such that the dTrpA1-activated cleaning movement was being performed at the time of dusting . They were shaken with or without dust and allowed to groom while their cleaning movements were recorded for behavioral analysis . ( A ) Representative manually annotated ethograms of GAL4 lines expressing dTrpA1 that were shaken with and without dust . The most common mutually exclusive movements performed by individual flies are displayed . R53A06 and R45G01 were not scored beyond 15 min because they had already progressed through the cleaning sequence . ( B\u2013E ) Most head cleaning bouts occur at the beginning of grooming both in wild-type flies and when other cleaning movements are artificially activated . Number of cleaning movements for each major body part in 100 s intervals after flies were shaken without or with dust ( plotted as the mean \u00b1 SEM; n = 5 ) . Different lines displayed are: control ( B ) , R40F04-GAL4/UAS-dTrpA1 ( head cleaning ) ( C ) , R24B03-GAL4/UAS-dTrpA1 ( abdominal cleaning ) ( D ) , R53A06-GAL4/UAS-dTrpA1 ( wing cleaning ) ( E ) . Artificially activated movements are displayed as lines with filled circles at each time interval . Dust stimulated cleaning movements ( not artificially activated ) are shown as lines with no filled circles . All head cleaning movements are combined ( labeled whole head ) . Friedman tests show a statistical difference between points in each head cleaning curve with dusted flies . This demonstrates that the numbers of head cleaning bouts at the beginning of grooming are higher than those at the end of the time course ( p values for each line shown as undusted , dusted ) . Control ( p = 0 . 817 , p = 0 . 0004 ) , R40F04 ( p = 0 . 147 , p = 0 . 00008 ) , R24B03 ( p = 0 . 3038 , p = 0 . 0038 ) , R53A06 ( p = 0 . 0599 , p = 0 . 0027 ) .

Triggering of cleaning movements is dust dependent . This experiment was designed to test between two possible mechanisms for the sequential induction of cleaning movements . One possibility is that activation of a preceding cleaning movement and its subsequent deactivation triggers the next movement . Alternatively , the next movement is completely determined by the distribution of dust on the body . ( A and B ) Cleaning movements performed during the first 3 min after the flies were cooled . GAL4 lines expressing UAS-dTrpA1 were shaken without ( A ) or with ( B ) dust and treated as described in the results . Movements were recorded and manually scored ( n = 10 flies per line per treatment ) . Ethograms of the scored behaviors are displayed by compressing all mutually exclusive events to a single line for each fly . UAS-dTrpA1-activation phenotypes are listed with the name of each GAL4 line . ( C and D ) Bar graphs of the frequencies of different movements in the first 3 min after flies were cooled that were undusted ( C ) or dusted ( D ) ( plotted as the mean \u00b1 SEM; n = 10 ) . Head cleaning sub movements are all binned because they are not easily distinguishable from one another when flies are dusted ( labeled whole head ) . Asterisks show samples that were significantly different from control from a Kruskal\u2013Wallis test followed by Mann\u2013Whitney U pairwise tests and Bonferroni correction ( p < 0 . 05 ) . Note that R23A07 and R40F04 showed increases in posterior cleaning movements that were not dust dependent . However , these movements were not increased to the same frequencies as those observed when the flies were dusted and cooled . Data shown in D is compiled and displayed in Figure 3C . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 02951 . 025 Our GAL4 lines allowed us to test this hierarchical suppression hypothesis by artificially driving cleaning of specific body parts while simultaneously dusting the flies to induce competing cleaning movements . For this experiment , we selected lines that could induce a particular cleaning module and lacked additional phenotypes that might confound our grooming-specific interpretations ( Figure 2 , lines labeled in red , Video 2 , Video 3 , Video 4 , Video 5 , Video 6 , Video 7 , Video 8 , and Video 9 ) . Figure 3B illustrates the outcome of these experiments , which matched the prediction of the hierarchical suppression hypothesis ( compare Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A to Figure 3B ) . For example , when a fly carrying a GAL4 driver that activates abdominal cleaning ( R24B03 ) was stimulated in the presence of whole-body dust , it first cleaned the head , then abdomen ( just as wild-type flies do ) , but then persisted in cleaning its abdomen instead of proceeding to its wings and thorax ( Figure 3B , Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2A , D , see R24B03 ) . This demonstrates that abdominal cleaning is below head cleaning but above wing and thoracic cleaning in the suppression hierarchy . In contrast , flies carrying GAL4 drivers that activate head cleaning ( R23A07 , R40F04 , R26B12 ) failed to remove dust from their posterior body , consistent with the hypothesis that the behavior would suppress posterior cleaning modules ( Figure 3B , Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . GAL4 lines that activated abdominal ( R24B03 ) , wing ( R53A06 ) , or all posterior cleaning modules ( R45G01 ) showed little impairment in removing dust from their heads ( Figure 3B , Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1 , see R24B03 , R53A06 , and R45G01 ) . Like wild-type flies , these GAL4 lines cleaned their heads at the onset of dusting , indicating that the normal progression of cleaning was preserved up to the point where it was blocked ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2A , D , E , see R24B03 , R53A06 , and R45G01 ) . This demonstrates that the \u2018endogenously\u2019 produced ( dust stimulated ) head-cleaning module suppressed strong , artificially activated abdominal , wing , and thoracic cleaning . The fact that head cleaning suppresses other movements through both artificial and endogenous activation argues against the possibility that suppression was an artifact of dTrpA1 activation . These results support our hypothesis that the cleaning modules are competing for output via an intermodular suppression that favors those that are hierarchically superior . The full suppression hierarchy of cleaning modules is: eyes > antennae > abdomen > wings > thorax , which mirrors the serial order of grooming observed in dusted flies . Although the priority order of cleaning module execution can be attributed to a suppression hierarchy , the sequential progression of grooming requires the termination of the hierarchically superior cleaning module followed by selection of the next module . One possible explanation for the observed progression is that each module sequentially triggers the next module in the series , analogous to an activation chain ( James , 1890; Adams , 1984 ) . We tested this possibility using the GAL4 lines to elicit different cleaning modules in the absence of dust to see if activation of one cleaning module would stimulate execution of the next module . We found that activation and subsequent acute deactivation of neurons that controlled a given cleaning module did not directly elicit the next module in the grooming sequence ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3A , C ) . This indicated that an activation chain among the cleaning modules is not sufficient to direct the progression of grooming . This conclusion is supported by observations that cleaning movements are only directed to the body part that is stimulated and not to other parts ( Vandervorst and Ghysen , 1980; Corfas and Dudai , 1989; Kays et al . , 2014 ) An alternative way by which grooming could progress is through a combination of the acute sensory cues provided by dust and the intrinsic suppression hierarchy among the cleaning modules . To test this hypothesis , we took advantage of the fact that artificial activation of specific cleaning modules blocks grooming of subordinate body parts ( Figure 3B ) . Thus , if the cleaning modules are evoked by dust on specific body parts , then flies released from artificial activation should initiate cleaning of the next dirty body part in the hierarchy . We tested this prediction by rapidly cooling the dusted GAL4/UAS-dTrpA1 flies shown in Figure 3B to a temperature at which dTrpA1 is inactive , and then observing the first cleaning movements performed . In effect , flies were returned to a normal behavioral state but with different distributions of dust on their bodies ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3A , C ) . Indeed , flies resumed cleaning the body part downstream of where the sequence had been blocked ( Figure 3C , Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3B , D ) . For example , flies with clean heads and abdomens , but dirty wings and thoraces , focused on cleaning their wings ( Figure 3C , line R24B03 ) . Thus , cleaning progresses to the next dirty and hierarchically superior part . We found that hierarchical suppression can mediate the selection of one among many simultaneously stimulated cleaning modules that are in competition for output . Between the proposed models describing how nervous systems execute serial actions , hierarchical suppression through competition is a core feature of parallel response models rather than activation chain models ( Houghton and Hartley , 1995; Bullock , 2004 ) . The general schema for this motor-control strategy for grooming is shown in Figure 4A and consists of three layers: a sensory layer , a hierarchical layer , and a winner-take-all layer . The sensory layer consists of parallel sensory inputs that each independently activate a specific cleaning module . The hierarchical layer establishes differences in the activation levels between the cleaning modules ( described in detail below ) . The winner-take-all layer then selects the module with the highest activation level by suppressing execution of the other modules . Once a module is selected , the reduced sensory drive that results from cleaning dust from the relevant body part gradually lowers its activation level , thereby allowing cleaning to proceed to whichever module has the next highest activation level ( In Figure 4A , the removal of dust by a module is represented with blunt arrows from the winner-take-all layer to the dust ) . Grooming proceeds from the module with the highest activation level to that with the lowest until dust is removed from all of the body parts . This organization leads to the emergence of sequential cleaning of body parts . 10 . 7554/eLife . 02951 . 026Figure 4 . Model of hierarchical suppression results in the sequential progression of grooming . ( A ) The dust induced grooming sequence requires three layers: ( 1 ) the sensory layer detects dust and independently activates each cleaning module . This is shown as parallel excitatory arrows from each yellow dust cartoon to activate specific cleaning modules . ( 2 ) The hierarchical layer determines each module's level of activation when its respective body part is coated in dust . Circle fill levels show theoretical differences in the relative activation levels of the modules . ( 3 ) The winner-take-all layer selects the cleaning module that is most active and suppresses all competing responses ( \u2018W\u2019 in this layer shows that the eye cleaning module is selected first ) . Theoretical all-to-all inhibitory connections in this layer are depicted as a gray box for simplicity . Blunt arrows from the winner-take-all layer to the yellow dust depict that the winning module reduces its own sensory input by cleaning off the dust and consequently becoming less active . The cleaning continues until the activation level of the module is no longer maximal , at which point the transition of cleaning to the new maximally active module occurs . Multiple iterations of this process result in a sequential progression . ( B\u2013D ) Computational model simulates possible implementations of the hierarchical layer in establishing the most active modules . Modifications to the hierarchical layer and sensory inputs are depicted in each diagram . In this simulation , the competition is between five different cleaning modules . The ethograms show typical results of the simulation , where each row corresponds to the output of a module . ( B ) Equal sensitivities to dust and no inhibitory connections . ( C ) Modules with varying sensory gain in response to dust: modules with higher sensory gain ( depicted with thicker arrows ) have higher activation levels in response to the same dust amount .

For simplicity of illustration , only the nearest-neighbor inhibitory connections are shown; in the computational implementation , each module inhibits all the subordinate modules in the hierarchy ( e . g . , 2 inhibits 3 , 4 , and 5 ) . ( E ) Constitutive activation of a single cleaning module . Simulated by setting the amount of dust on a particular body part to completely dirty after each round of cleaning ( depicted with the red arrow ) . ( F ) Constitutive activation of a single cleaning module in the presence of dust on all body parts . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 02951 . 026 The general strategy of hierarchical suppression can be implemented using two related schemata . We simulated both possible implementations with a computational model to test if they were sufficient to explain the progression of grooming that we observed . The winner-take-all layer is the same for both implementations . Winner-take-all neural networks can be modeled using all-to-all inhibitory connections between the different units; however , conceptually , they simply select the most active unit and inhibit the rest ( Houghton and Hartley , 1995 ) . In the model presented here , we selected the cleaning module with the highest activation level by using a maximum function ( \u2018Materials and Methods\u2019 ) . The only difference between the two implementations of the model is how the activation level of each cleaning module is set in the hierarchical layer . If no differences are set in the relative activation levels between modules , the result is unordered grooming , with equal probability of the modules occurring ( Figure 4B ) . Alternatively , the sensitivity to dust ( sensory gain ) across the modules can be varied , such that their activation levels are proportional to the amount of dust on each body part , weighted by their sensitivity to the dust stimulus ( gain of response to the dust stimulus ) . With this schema , modules with the highest sensory gain had a higher probability of being selected than those with lower gains , reproducing the observed sequence of grooming behavior ( Figure 4C ) . We see a similar result when the differences in the activation levels of the competing modules arise from unidirectional ( asymmetric ) lateral inhibitory connections ( Figure 4D ) . Thus , both simulations produce the sequential selection of cleaning modules observed in grooming behavior . This demonstrates that hierarchical suppression can be established through either variable sensory gain or direct unidirectional inhibition , in conjunction with winner-take-all selection of the module with the highest activation level . The model of hierarchical suppression also replicates the returns to previous cleaning modules that we observed with dusted flies ( Figure 1E ) . Based on the computational model , this occurs when the cleaning modules have relatively similar activation levels . For example , when no hierarchical differences are set among the modules ( i . e . , Figure 4B ) , they are all activated to nearly the same level in response to dust , and their selection is dependent only on slight differences in dust levels on their corresponding body parts . Once selected , a cleaning module reduces dust on its body part , causing its activation level to drop below that of the next cleaning module . That next module is then selected and cleans the associated body part until its own activation level falls below that of another module , and so on . Thus , incremental amounts of dust are removed from body parts while frequent switching occurs among the different modules ( Figure 4B ) . In the case where a hierarchy is set among the cleaning modules ( i . e . , Figure 4C\u2013D ) , the selection of those that are most hierarchically superior is initially very probable because their activation levels are relatively high in response to the starting amount of dust . As dust is removed , however , these levels among the modules become more similar . This equalization of activation levels through dust removal results in return cleaning by the modules , and the simulations shown in Figure 4C , D come to more closely resemble that of Figure 4B as cleaning progresses . Such return cleaning is also seen in wild-type grooming flies , and can thus be explained by our parallel model ( Figure 1E ) . In addition to simulating the grooming progression , the model recapitulates two other important features of our experimental data . First , it can mimic the constitutive cleaning phenotypes of GAL4 lines expressing dTrpA1 in the absence of dust . Constitutive activation was implemented by setting a particular body part to be fully dusted regardless of the amount of cleaning done ( as if the sensory neurons were constantly active ) . This resulted in the continual cleaning of a particular body part without triggering any other cleaning modules ( Figure 4E ) . Second , the model recapitulates the hierarchical suppression that we observed in our competition experiments ( shown in Figure 3A ) . Adding dust to all body parts in the presence of the constitutive activation of a module and unidirectional inhibitory connections simulated hierarchical suppression . This leads to sequential cleaning by the hierarchically superior modules , whereas cleaning by the inferior modules was absent , despite the presence of dust ( Figure 4F ) . Thus , we find close agreement between the experimental results and the model of grooming behavior , both in the progression of cleaning modules down the hierarchical levels and in the ability of modules higher in the hierarchy to suppress the modules below . Our model explains how the sequential selection of cleaning modules occurs , but could it also explain the frequent alternations between cleaning the body parts and leg rubbing that occur throughout the grooming progression ? These alternations are an important and prominent feature in normal grooming behavior for efficient dust removal ( Figure 1E , G , Figure 5A ) . In order to simulate the alternations , we considered leg rubbing to be a member of the same suppression hierarchy with the other cleaning modules and ran the model simulation based on two premises ( Figure 5B ) . First , leg rubbing occurs at all stages of grooming . Therefore , it would necessarily be among the most hierarchically superior of the cleaning modules to be able to suppress cleaning by the others . Second , dust accumulates on the legs while they clean the body parts . This accumulation of dust increases the activation level to the point where leg rubbing is active and the body cleaning modules are subsequently suppressed . The removal of dust from the legs through leg rubbing then reduces suppression on the body cleaning modules and allows cleaning of the corresponding body parts to resume . This cyclic accumulation and removal of dust from the legs during body cleaning could account for the high transition probabilities between the leg and body modules . When we simulated leg rubbing in the model , the sequential progression of body cleaning modules down the hierarchy was preserved ( Figure 5C ) . The simulation also produced the cyclic alternations between cleaning of a body part and leg rubbing that we observed in our empirically obtained ethograms of wild-type flies ( Figure 5C , D ) . We conclude that hierarchical relationships among the cleaning modules mediate not only their sequential execution , but also the cyclic transition dynamics between body cleaning and leg rubbing . 10 . 7554/eLife . 02951 . 027Figure 5 . Hierarchical suppression mediates the cyclic transitions between cleaning modules . Leg rubbing was simulated in the grooming model based on two features . ( 1 ) The legs accumulate dust as they remove it from the body parts . Leg rubbing is subsequently executed to remove that dust . ( 2 ) The sensory gain on the legs was set high relative to the other cleaning modules such that they are the most active and selected in the winner-take-all layer when they were sufficiently dirty . ( A ) Ethogram example of a wild-type fly grooming for comparison to the simulation . ( B ) Model of the leg rubbing and body part cleaning cycle ( head cleaning example shown ) . Leg rubbing is hierarchically associated with the body-cleaning modules ( similar to the associations among the cleaning modules described in Figure 4 ) . The only difference between leg rubbing and the other modules is the accumulation of dust on the legs during body part cleaning . This is depicted by a forked connection that removes dust from the head ( blunt arrow ) and transfers it to the legs ( arrow to the leg rubbing module ) . ( C ) Simulation of grooming with leg rubbing and four body-cleaning modules ( result is typical ) . ( D ) Typical examples of cyclic switching between body cleaning and leg rubbing . The ethogram on the left displays a wild-type fly cleaning its head and the one on the right shows a simulated head-cleaning bout ( each example is from early time points in A or C respectively ) . ( E ) Average spatial distribution of dust on each body part that remains when flies were coated in dust while leg rubbing was activated ( 25 min after dusting ) . V = ventral , D = dorsal . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 02951 . 027 Our model predicts that leg rubbing is among the most hierarchically superior of the cleaning modules . Therefore , if leg rubbing is constitutively activated , it should suppress cleaning of the other body parts in a competition experiment where flies are coated in dust . We tested this prediction by using a GAL4 line that drove strong leg rubbing of both the front and hind legs ( Figure 2 , R17F11 ) . When these flies were coated in dust , they were unable to completely clean their bodies , indicating that the body cleaning modules were suppressed ( Figure 5E , Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B ) . This supports the prediction that leg rubbing is part of a grooming suppression hierarchy . However , cleaning of some body parts were suppressed more than others , suggesting that leg rubbing is not the most superiorly positioned module in the suppressive hierarchy . For example , activated leg rubbing did not suppress eye cleaning . This suggests that eye cleaning is at the top of the grooming hierarchy . Additionally , leg rubbing only weakly suppressed cleaning of the abdomen . Given that abdominal cleaning is the most hierarchically superior of the cleaning modules performed by the hind legs , this may suggest that hind leg rubbing and abdominal cleaning are more equal in their positions in the hierarchy . These results indicate that our model can explain the main observed features of the grooming progression , including the sequential cleaning of body parts and the frequent alternations between leg rubbing and body part cleaning . \n Hierarchical associations among different available behavioral options allow for those behaviors with the highest value for a given circumstance to be selected while all others are suppressed . These concepts are often referred to as behavioral choice , action selection , motor program selection , or decision making ( Davis , 1979; Redgrave et al . , 1999; Kupfermann and Weiss , 2001; Kristan , 2008 ) . For example , mollusks will suppress mating in order to feed ( Davis , 1979 ) . This suggests that food is rarer than potential mates , and thus feeding has a higher value than mating . We find that a suppression hierarchy mediates the selection of competing cleaning movements that cannot be executed at the same time . The existence of this hierarchy suggests that inherent values are placed on cleaning the different body parts and selecting one over others represents a \u2018best\u2019 choice . Eye cleaning is executed first in response to dust and is the most hierarchically superior cleaning module . This suggests a high value for flies to keep their eyes clear of debris . Because clean legs are necessary for cleaning each body part , their position near the top of the hierarchy is necessary for efficient debris removal . The antennae may have high value to flies because of the number of different sensory modalities that they house ( e . g . , audition , olfaction , gravity sensing , wind detection ) ( Laissue and Vosshall , 2008; Kamikouchi et al . , 2009; Yorozu et al . , 2009; B\u00f6r\u00f6czky et al . , 2013; Wilson , 2013 ) . Keeping the abdomen clear of debris is likely critical for respiration as it contains numerous spiracles ( Phillis et al . , 1993; Heymann and Lehmann , 2006 ) . Because of these different values on behavioral motor programs , animals have evolved mechanisms for selecting the most favorable option and suppressing others . A significant finding of this work is the experimental demonstration that hierarchical suppression among many behaviors leads to the emergence of a sequence . Although much attention has focused on the role of hierarchical suppression in selecting between behavioral choices , there is little experimental evidence to support its role as a mechanism for eliciting action sequences . The grooming sequence may be considered as a series of \u2018forced choices\u2019 among different competing cleaning modules that are selected in priority order through suppression . As each body part is cleaned , suppression of the other cleaning modules is lifted , and a new round of competition between the remaining cleaning options occurs . Our work lends strong support to an emerging view that hierarchical suppression is a ubiquitous action selection mechanism , whether it is used in deciding among available behavioral choices , or selecting movements performed in complex serial tasks . Thus , the evolutionarily ancient ability to select among competing behaviors through hierarchical suppression may have provided the necessary infrastructure to perform motor actions in sequence ( Houghton and Hartley , 1995 ) . Activation chain and parallel models describe two different mechanisms for generating sequential behavior . Activation chains ( sometimes referred to as associative chaining , response chaining , or stimulus-response reflex chaining ) are the simplest form of sequential execution . These work through feedforward activation of the next movement by the previous one ( James , 1890 ) . Parallel models ( also known as competitive queuing ) select movements through winner-take-all inhibition among the different motor units that are competing for output ( Houghton and Hartley , 1995; Bullock , 2004 ) . Thus , the primary difference between the models is movement selection through either feedforward excitatory or competitive inhibitory mechanisms . Two lines of evidence argue against a primary role for an activation chain in driving the dust-induced grooming sequence . First , each cleaning movement can be activated by local stimulation of its respective body part without triggering other movements ( Vandervorst and Ghysen , 1980; Corfas and Dudai , 1989; Kays et al . , 2014 ) . Either local stimulation ( Figure 3C ) or neuronal activation ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3C ) of a particular body part-cleaning module activates only one module and does not trigger the others . Feedforward activation models predict a chain of different cleaning modules once the sequence is triggered rather than just one ( James , 1890; Rhodes et al . , 2004 ) . Second , the observed structure of grooming behavior in fully dusted flies is inconsistent with an activation chain model . As flies progressively groom their bodies , the transitions among different cleaning modules are gradual ( Figure 1D , E , Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4B , Figure 4B\u2013D ) . These gradual transitions are characterized by return cleaning among the modules , meaning that previous cleaning modules are revisited after later modules were already selected . Cleaning modules elicited through feedforward activation are not likely to exhibit such return cleaning , but should produce more deterministic sequences , such as those observed for zebra finch bird song ( Long et al . , 2010 ) . Although it is possible that activation chains mediate some aspects of grooming behavior , our evidence indicates that a parallel model alone is fully sufficient to reproduce major features of the dust-induced grooming sequence ( discussed below ) . We find that the grooming sequence has features that are similar to parallel models of serial behavior . Both involve the parallel activation of premotor units in the sequence . The activation of the cleaning modules occurs through dust sensing , where each module is independently stimulated by a dust stimulus on its corresponding body part . Coating the body of the flies in dust leads to the parallel stimulation of the modules , and thus competition among them . Parallel models resolve such simultaneous activation schemes by creating a gradient of activity levels among the units that are executed in the sequence and selecting the one with the highest activity in a winner-take-all network . Our computational model of grooming works through a similar mechanism ( Figure 4A ) . We find that either differences in the sensory gain of the dust response or unidirectional ( asymmetric ) lateral inhibitory connections among the modules can generate an activity gradient . The most active cleaning module is selected in the winner-take-all layer while the others are suppressed . Parallel models propose that the sequence progresses when the selected unit is deleted , and a new round of competition and suppression occurs between the remaining units . In grooming , the active module \u2018deletes\u2019 itself from the sequence by reducing the dust stimulated sensory drive through cleaning ( Figure 4A ) . Thus , all of the major features of parallel models are present in our model of sequential grooming behavior ( parallel activation , competition , activity gradient , winner-take-all selection , and deletion ) . The finding that grooming behavior displays both sequential and cyclic transitions between modules offers an extension to our understanding of the flexibility of parallel models in producing different types of serial behavior . We found that fruit flies make frequent transitions between body cleaning and leg rubbing and that these oscillations can be explained by the same hierarchical rules as those that govern the sequential progression of the behavior ( Figure 5 ) . The only difference between leg rubbing and body cleaning is that the act of cleaning the body part leads to the transfer of dust to the legs , which then activates leg rubbing ( Figure 5D ) . The cyclic transfer and removal of the dust input leads to oscillatory behavior . Thus , simple modifications to the infrastructure underlying parallel models could produce different types of transition dynamics between modules ( i . e . , sequential progression and oscillatory dynamics ) . This demonstrates that these models can generate behaviors of increasing adaptive complexity . Does fruit fly grooming behavior provide insight into the organization of more complex motor sequences ? Our model of the grooming progression has features like those proposed to explain learned sequences that also require parallel activation of units that compete for motor output . An example of this was derived from studies of human typing that revealed that adjacent letters in a word were often exchanged in error . This suggested that a plan for all the letters necessary to generate a word was readied prior to typing and that execution of each letter competed for output based on a hierarchical prioritization scheme and winner-take-all competition ( Lashley , 1951 ) . Such studies led to the proposal of parallel models as a way nervous systems implement sequential behavior ( Houghton and Hartley , 1995; Bullock , 2004 ) . To our knowledge , work presented here provides the first evidence of a parallel model in an innate behavior and suggests that this organization may be more widespread than previously thought . Putting these concepts together with those discussed about behavioral choice leads to the consideration of the possibility that the neural infrastructure driving simple behavioral choice has served as a framework for the evolution of complex sequential behaviors such as typing ( Houghton and Hartley , 1995 ) . The unifying feature of these vastly different examples of action selection is hierarchical suppression among competing actions . This raises the possibility that the underlying neural circuits have common organizational features . In this study , we took advantage of the modularity of grooming to interrogate its behavioral organization . We gained the experimental control necessary for probing this organization by identifying GAL4 lines that target neurons whose activation drove specific cleaning modules . We show cause and effect experiments indicating that suppressive interactions among the modules govern their selection . Many behaviors are thought to consist of subdivisions of simpler motor programs . This approach of acutely manipulating subcomponents of behaviors and assessing how they affect the other components may prove useful for exploring the organization of other complex motor behaviors . Our results do not address the neural circuits that mediate the grooming progression but rather suggest possible types of circuit organization that could underlie its sequential nature . Many complex behaviors are likely to involve hundreds or even thousands of neurons and information about the behavioral organization helps focus circuit-mapping efforts on specific features . For example , one prediction of our model of hierarchical suppression points to unidirectional lateral inhibitory connections among the cleaning modules ( Figure 4D ) . Previous work has demonstrated that such inhibition can occur through direct inhibitory connections from hierarchically superior behavioral circuits to subordinate competing circuits ( Kovac and Davis , 1977 ) . Therefore , it may be reasonable to search for direct inhibitory connections among the cleaning motor programs . Alternatively , such inhibition among behavioral motor programs may be due to shared neural circuits . In this case , the activity of a behavioral motor program suppresses another , solely because the shared circuit components cannot drive two behaviors at once ( Briggman and Kristan , 2008 ) . Future experiments will address whether these or other neural circuit mechanisms govern hierarchical inhibition in serial grooming . Thus , the work presented here provides not only a framework for future experiments to understand how neurons and neural circuits mediate serial grooming , but also a basis for extrapolation to analogous organizational logic in other network-driven sequences . The GAL4 lines identified in this study target neurons that activate specific cleaning modules without inducing other behavioral phenotypes . What types of neurons might these GAL4 lines target ? Two types that are already implicated in initiating movements are sensory and command neurons . Sensory neurons can activate specific motor programs as the initiators of stimulus-response circuits ( Sherrington , 1906; Huston and Jayaraman , 2011 ) . In fruit fly grooming , mechanosensory neuron-coupled bristles can trigger cleaning responses with mechanical stimulation ( Vandervorst and Ghysen , 1980; Corfas and Dudai , 1989 ) . This suggests that activation of these sensory neurons with dTrpA1 could trigger the specific cleaning modules . Command neurons have been defined as interneurons that are necessary and sufficient for activating specific motor programs ( Kupfermann and Weiss , 1978 ) . However , the neurons targeted by the GAL4 lines used in this study only show sufficiency for activating cleaning movements as expression of UAS-Shibirets1 or UAS-TNT were unable to block cleaning ( unpublished data ) . This may be explained if the GAL4-targeted neurons are those referred to as \u2018command-like\u2019 ( also known as command systems , decision neurons , or higher order interneurons ) ( Kupfermann and Weiss , 2001; Kristan , 2008 ) . These neural types are sufficient to activate particular motor programs but do not necessarily fit the strict criteria of also being necessary . Thus , we propose that sensory neurons , command-like neurons , or both activate the cleaning modules . The expression patterns of the GAL4 lines in this study vary in the numbers and types of cells that they target , raising the question as to which neurons in each pattern activate the cleaning modules ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . It is likely that the lines target a mixed population of neurons , where only some are grooming specific . There are examples of GAL4 lines that activate specific behaviors , where only a subset of the neurons within each expression pattern confers the phenotype ( von Philipsborn et al . , 2011; Luan et al . , 2012 ) . Alternatively , the enhancer fragments used in generating the GAL4 lines might target expression to many different types of neurons involved in the same behavior ( Pfeiffer et al . , 2008 ) . For example , the fruitless gene is expressed in 1500 neurons of different types that comprise elements of a courtship circuit ( Yu et al . , 2010 ) . Activation of this population of fruitless neurons with dTrpA1 is sufficient to trigger courtship behavior ( Pan et al . , 2011 ) . Further refinement of the expression patterns driven by the GAL4 line enhancers will allow us to distinguish between these possibilities . Thus , we anticipate that identifying the neural circuitry for each cleaning module and determining how these circuitries interact will reveal how the serial organization of grooming behavior is encoded in the nervous system through a hierarchical suppression mechanism . \n Canton S flies were obtained from Martin Heisenberg's lab in Wurzburg , Germany . GAL4 stocks were generated in Gerry Rubin's lab at Janelia Research Campus by methods described previously ( Pfeiffer et al . , 2008 ) and are available at the Bloomington stock center ( Jenett et al . , 2012 ) . BDPGAL4U was used as a control for the GAL4 lines in our experiments and contains the vector backbone used to generate the GAL4 collection ( including GAL4 ) but lacks an enhancer to drive its expression . UAS-dTrpA1 ( on the second chromosome ) was obtained from Paul Garrity at Brandeis University ( Hamada et al . , 2008 ) . 20xUAS-mCD8::GFP ( JFRC7 ) was constructed as described in Pfeiffer et al . ( 2010 ) . GAL4 lines were crossed to their respective UAS drivers , and both the parents and their progeny were maintained using the following conditions . Flies were reared at 21\u201322\u00b0C and 50% relative humidity using a 16/8 hr light/dark cycle on standard cornmeal and molasses food . All experiments were done with 5- to 8-day-old males . Multiwell grooming chambers: blocks of grooming chambers were designed to facilitate the parallel and uniform dusting of flies for dust pattern measurements and recording videos of cleaning behavior . Blocks were fabricated with 24 or 96 grooming chambers ( 15 . 6 mm or 7 mm diameters respectively ) and have connector ends and dust removal ends . The connector end has tracks for thin aluminum sliders that gate each chamber to facilitate fly loading ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . The dust removal end consists of a Nitex mesh-covered opening that allows free dust to exit the chamber while preventing flies from escaping ( Genesee Scientific Corporation , San Diego , California , 630 \u03bcm mesh ) . Chambers were printed on a 3D printer . 24-well aluminum chambers ( for cooling experiments ) : aluminum chambers were identical to those described above , with the exception that the dust removal end was closed such that flies would stand directly on the aluminum ( shown in Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1E , F ) . These chambers were fabricated for rapid cooling of flies to quickly shut off dTrpA1-activated behaviors . Design plans for the grooming chambers are available in Supplementary file 1 . All experiments were carried out in a warm room that was set to 30\u201332\u00b0C . Flies were cold anesthetized ( 1\u20132\u00b0C ) , transferred to grooming chambers ( single fly per chamber ) , and allowed to recover for at least 15 min before assaying . Flies were tapped from the chambers into multiwell plates containing measured amounts of Reactive Yellow 86 dust ( Organic Dyestuffs Corporation , Concord , North Carolina ) and shaken to uniformly coat each fly ( Phillis et al . , 1993 ) . Excess dust was removed by tapping the flies against the mesh on the dust removal end of the grooming block . The flies were then allowed to clean in the chambers with the mesh side down to allow dust to exit . Video recordings of flies were made with a clear acrylic plug covering the adaptor end of the chamber ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1D ) . Grooming was terminated at different time points by anesthetizing the flies with CO2 . 0-min time samples were obtained by dusting the flies and immediately anesthetizing them . Data were acquired from at least four separate crosses . 25 min was chosen as the assay end because most body parts were clean at that point . Dusted flies were prepared as described above and dissected for imaging of their dust patterns . The dissection procedure made it impossible to image the entire body surface of a single fly . Each part was dissected as described below . Heads: flies were decapitated using a razor blade , and the heads were affixed face up to a cover slip with double-sided tape ( 3M Corporation , St . Paul , Minnesota ) . Wings: the left ( lateral ) wings were removed by grasping the base with a pair of forceps and pulling it off with an adjacent pair of forceps . They were affixed dorsal side up to a cover slip with double-sided tape . Ventral abdomen: dissected and imaged shortly after performing grooming assays because the abdomens desiccated quickly . Flies were held on their sides with a scalpel inserted between the head and thorax while all legs and wings were removed . The scalpel was then used to decapitate the fly . Next , the thorax and dorsal abdomen were glued to a cover slip such that the ventral abdomen was facing up using Elmer's No-Wrinkle Rubber Cement ( Elmer\u2019s Products , Inc . , Columbus , Ohio ) . Dorsal abdomen: flies were held on their sides and the ventral side of the thorax and legs were severed from the dorsal side along a plane that was parallel to the abdomen . The wings were removed and the abdomen was glued dorsal side up . Thoraces: no dissection was necessary for imaging thoraces . They were imaged in specially designed chamber that would hold all flies uniformly dorsal side up . Standard preparations and example dirty samples for each body part are displayed in Figure 1B . Body parts were imaged using a Zeiss SteREO Discovery . V12 equipped with an Achromat S 1 . 0\u00d7 objective ( Carl Zeiss Corporation , Oberkochen , Germany ) . Heads , abdomens , wings , and thoraces were imaged at 80\u00d7 , 60\u00d7 , 65\u00d7 , and 60\u00d7 respectively . Z-series were taken and the images were converted into a single , in focus , image with Zeiss AxioVision software using the Extended Focus module ( Figure 1B , Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A ) . Experimental images were manually warped to standard images ( see standards and experimental examples Figure 1B ) using the Photoshop transform tool to ensure that the coordinates on each image corresponded to the same location ( Adobe Systems Incorporated , San Jose , California ) . Yellow dust patterns were isolated from each experimental image using the Photoshop color range tool and converted to grayscale . The contrast was then adjusted to 100% to set all dust pixels to a 255 grayscale value ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2B ) . To visually display the average dust patterns , we used custom Matlab ( MathWorks , Inc . , Natick , Massachusetts ) code ( Groomogram ) to generate average projections ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2C , code included as Source code 1 ) . Groomogram code works by averaging the grayscale pixel values ( 0 = no dust/255 = dust ) for each pixel coordinate from all experimental images . The average pixel values for the entire image were converted to grayscale colormaps that represent the percent of flies with dust at a particular pixel coordinate ( Figure 1B , Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2D ) . Calculating normalized dust pixels in a specified region: pixels with 255 grayscale values ( dust pixels ) , and located within the regions designated by standard masks were counted for each image ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3A , B ) . The fractions of dust pixels per total number of pixels in each region as defined by the masks were calculated for each image sample . Normalization in Figure 1D was calculated as follows: fractions of dust pixels per sample were divided by the mean of the zero time point samples for each body part . Standard error was calculated from these values . Normalization in Figure 3B was calculated as follows: average dust pixel fractions per body region were divided by the maximum mean value for each body part . The ventral and dorsal abdominal data were combined for display in Figure 3B by calculating the mean of their normalized values . Camera setup: an Edmund Optics 1312C color USB camera ( Edmund Optics Corporation , Barrington , New Jersey ) equipped with a Computar 25 mm f1 . 4 lens and an EX2C extender for C-mount ( CBC AMERICA Corporation , Commack , New York ) was used to record flies at 30 frames per second . dTrpA1 behavioral analysis ( undusted flies ) : this method was used for recording the flies shown in Figure 2 . Flies were cold anesthetized at 1\u20132\u00b0C and placed into a 3 mm high and 13 mm diameter arena sitting directly on a teca solid state heat/cool cold plate ( TECA Corporation , Chicago , Illinois ) . The flies were allowed at least 5 min to recover from the cold anesthesia and then recorded for 2 min when the cold plate temperature sensor read 21\u00b0C , 30\u00b0C , and then 21\u00b0C ( post activation analysis ) ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . Dusted experiments: Canton S or GAL4/UAS-dTrpA1 flies were dusted individually in 24-well grooming chambers as described above . An acrylic plug was inserted into the hole on the adapter end and the aluminum slider was removed such that the fly could be recorded ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1D ) . Flies were also shaken without dust and recorded as a control for the behavioral effects of the shaking . Dusted/cooled experiments: flies were shaken with or without dust , allowed to groom for 25 min at 30\u00b0C , cooled to 18\u00b0C , and their behavior was recorded for 3 min . After grooming for 24 min at 30\u00b0C , the flies were transferred to a 24-well aluminum grooming block that was preheated to 30\u00b0C . Just before 25 min , an acrylic plug was placed over the chamber opening and the block was placed on a TECA cold plate that was set to 18\u00b0C to rapidly cool the flies and shut off the dTrpA1 channel . Cleaning movements were scored for 3 min starting when the plate touched the cold plate surface ( Figure 3C , Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3 ) . Pre-recorded video was manually scored using Noldus Observer XT 7 . 0 software ( Noldus Information Technology , Wageningen , Netherlands ) . A list of cleaning movements was compiled and modified from two different studies ( Szebenyi , 1969; Dawkins and Dawkins , 1976 ) . Flies clean their bodies with their front or hind legs as mutually exclusive events ( Figure 1A ) . Front leg cleaning movements are directed to the head whereas the hind legs clean the abdomen , wings , and thoraces . Starts of cleaning events are defined when the legs are farthest anterior ( hind leg movements ) or posterior ( front leg movements ) of the body part before they sweep in the opposite direction . Transitions between movements were included at the end of the preceding movement . Wing cleaning with the hind legs and leg rubbing using the second legs were sometimes asymmetrically performed in that one leg performed cleaning of a particular body part while the contralateral leg was stationary . Eye and head cleaning: legs sweep across the eyes , tops , and bottoms of the head as it is rotated . Most sweeps across the eyes occur in the absence of head rotation . Antennae: legs are directed towards the antennal region , often while the head is tilted slightly forward . The legs sometimes grab the antennae and pull them away from the head . Proboscis: sweeps down the length of the extended proboscis . The amount of proboscis extension does not factor into the definition as long as it is partially extended or seen moving with the legs . Ventral head: legs sweep the ventral side of the head with no proboscis extension . The front legs almost always sweep the bottom of the head/proboscis in parallel . Note , proboscis and ventral head cleaning were binned with eye and head cleaning for simplicity . Whole head: all of the head cleaning behaviors described above are binned . The whole head designation was used because it was not possible to distinguish between eye , head , and antennal cleaning when flies were dusted . Abdominal cleaning: legs sweep the ventral or dorsal surface of the abdomen . The hind legs sometimes clean the genitals . This was included as abdominal cleaning for simplicity . Wing cleaning: each leg sweeps the ipsilateral dorsal side of the wings simultaneously , or one at a time . Alternatively , both legs clean a single wing with the ipsilateral leg cleaning the dorsal side and the contralateral leg cleaning the ventral side . Sweeping or kicking the ventral part of the wing with one or both legs was also referred to as wing cleaning . In this case , as the legs sweep anterior to posterior , the wings lift away from the body . Thoracic cleaning: hind legs sweep the thorax from anterior to posterior with one or both legs . Front/hind leg rubbing: distal parts of the legs are rubbed together . Behavior begins at the moment that the legs touch each other . If the legs stop motion but remain together , it is defined as leg rubbing as long as they do not touch the ground . The middle legs were sometimes rubbed together with the front or the hind legs . This was included with front leg or hind leg rubbing depending on the leg pair being used with the second legs . Standing: fly does not move more than a body length from the original scored position and does not perform any grooming movements . The beginning of standing is scored as soon as the last leg touches the ground . In some cases , the legs did not touch the ground to initiate the behavior and instead was scored at the point where the previous behavior was judged to have ceased . Walking: fly steps more than a body length with no pauses in leg movement . Walking is also defined as moving from one of the following locations in the chamber to another ( floor , ceiling , or side ) . The beginning of walking is scored at the moment that one of the front legs initiates a step . Manually scored behavioral video was analyzed as follows . Bout frequency: total number of starts of each behavior per fly . Bout frequency per interval: bout starts that fell within a designated time interval . Marginal probability: the average fraction of total bouts of a particular behavior . Change from control: the experimental parameter ( either bout frequency or fraction of time ) was subtracted from the control . Statistical test: control and experimental flies were compared using a Kruskal\u2013Wallis test . Post-hoc Mann\u2013Whitney U pairwise tests were then performed with Bonferroni correction . Transition probability: calculated by counting the number of transitions from each behavior to each other behavior . Next , we calculated the fraction of times that behavior i transitioned to behavior j given the total of number of transitions to all behaviors . Therefore , the probability of going from behavior i to all other behaviors sums to 1 . GAL4 lines used in this study were obtained from a screen designed to identify and manipulate neural circuitry involved in grooming behavior . We used a collection of enhancer-driven GAL4 lines to genetically target different subsets of neurons with the neural activator UAS-dTrpA1 ( Hamada et al . , 2008; Pfeiffer et al . , 2008; Jenett et al . , 2012 ) . Over 1500 GAL4 lines expressing dTrpA1 were manually examined at 30\u201332\u00b0C for increased grooming compared with wild type . We manually scored the movements of 12 identified GAL4 lines that were sufficient to activate strong cleaning movements ( Figure 2 ) . GAL4 lines used in this study were sufficient to activate cleaning movements but not necessary for cleaning dust off their respective body parts . This was revealed by inhibition and dusting experiments using both UAS-Shibirets1 or UAS-TNT ( data not shown ) . GAL4 lines expressing GFP were stained and their patterns imaged using previously published methods ( Pfeiffer et al . , 2010 ) . Two neural network architectures were used to simulate the hierarchical suppression among competing cleaning modules: a sensory gain model ( SGM , Figure 4C ) and a unidirectional inhibition model ( UIM , Figure 4D ) . Both neural networks were implemented using Matlab 7 ( code included as Source code 2 ) . Both networks are based on three layers: sensory layer , hierarchical layer , and winner-take-all layer . Sensory and hierarchical layers: for both network implementations , we defined a vector of activation levels , a , to represent N neural modules ( this is the hierarchical layer ) . For the UIM architecture , the activation levels are initially set to equal the vector of amounts of dust , d ( this is the sensory input layer ) . The initial amount of dust was set to 0 . 9 + r , where r is a random value between 0 and 0 . 1 , sampled from uniform distribution . This noise term is only a factor in Figure 4B ( no hierarchy set among the modules ) where slight differences in the relative dust levels determine which module is selected first . While for the SGM architecture , the vector a = dws , where ws is the vector of sensory weights . In UIM , ws is set to one ( no sensory gain differences ) and vector a is then multiplied by the N \u00d7 N weight matrix , W , of which the diagonal = 1 , and the upper triangle is populated by equal negative weights , w = \u22120 . 5 . For SGM , ws is set to ws = [wmax , w1 , w2 , \u2026 wmin] , which insures that the sensory weights decrease from the first module to the last . Thus , for each iteration i , we update the activation levels as follows:ai+1=diws , SGMai+1=aiW , UIM For simulating no hierarchical differences among the modules ( shown Figure 4B ) , we set ws to 1 , and the upper triangle of W to 0 . Winner-take-all layer: to simulate removal of dust from the body parts , this layer first finds the module with the highest activation level that was set by SGM or UIM . The position of the module with maximal activation level , ma , is determined: ma = max ( a ) . The winner-take-all layer is then simply a binary vector e containing all zeros and equals 1 only in the position ma , thus pointing to the body part where cleaning behavior will be executed . Next , a constant amount of dust , dr , is subtracted from the math position in vector d ( dma ) . Thus , for each iteration i: Note: we did not explicitly simulate the circuitry required for implementation of the winner-take-all layer . Instead , we selected the module with maximal activation level ( ma ) by simply using the Matlab max ( ) function . Winner-take-all neural networks can be modeled using all-to-all inhibitory connections between the different modules ( Houghton and Hartley , 1995 ) . Such explicit simulations of winner-take-all function might capture the empirically observed behavior even better but would require more complex modeling , going beyond the scope of the claims presented in this work . Constitutive activation of cleaning modules: to implement constitutive cleaning of a particular body part , we held the dust level of a given cleaning module constant ( at maximum dust level ) ( Figure 4E , F ) . This models the situation where the fly is receiving constant sensory input even in the absence of stimulus . Leg rubbing: to implement leg rubbing , we assumed two pairs of legs . Both pairs were assigned an initial activation level ( al; a 2 dimensional vector ) , which was directly proportional to the amount of dust on legs ( dl ) . For each iteration i , we added a small , constant amount of dust to the pair of legs assigned to clean the body part with the maximal activation level ( ma ) . If ma =< 3 ( \u2018anterior body parts\u2019 ) the first leg pair was assigned and if ma > 3 ( \u2018posterior body parts\u2019 ) the second leg pair was assigned to collect dust . Therefore , with each grooming iteration , the activation level of the associated pair of legs increases . Leg rubbing ( removal of dust from legs themselves ) is initiated under two conditions: ( 1 ) the activation level of the pair crosses a stationary threshold ( same for both pairs ) and ( 2 ) the activation level of the pair is above the activation level of any body part ( above ma ) , including the other pair of legs . The latter condition assures that leg rubbing is still part of the competitive hierarchy of cleaning modules ( Figure 5C , D ) . Model output and display: the output of the model is the position of the cleaning module with the maximum activation level at iteration i ( mai ) . Thus the output is an array with rows corresponding to mai ( active cleaning module ) and columns corresponding to iteration i ( \u2018time\u2019 ) . This array was used to generate the ethograms shown in Figure 4 and Figure 5 .", "headings": ["Abstract", "Introduction", "Results", "Discussion", "Materials and methods"], "keywords": ["neuroscience"], "id": "elife-02951-v1"}
{"lay_summary": "Human reproductive cells\u2014eggs and sperm\u2014are produced through a process called meiosis . This means a \u2018parent\u2019 cell in the ovaries or testes undergoes two stages of cell division: it first divides into two cells , which then divide again to produce four \u2018daughter\u2019 cells . A crucial part of meiosis is ensuring that each daughter cell has half the number of chromosomes that the parent cell did . Before the first round of meiosis , the chromosomes in the parent cell are copied to produce enough chromosomes for the four daughter cells . The distribution of these chromosomes between the daughter cells is determined by the opposing forces acting on them . The pairs of identical chromosomes produced during the copying process are held together by a proteinaceous glue , while microtubules attached to a structure called the spindle\u2014which has poles at opposite ends of the cell\u2014try to pull these pairs of chromosomes apart . Rattani et al . now show that a protein called shugoshin-like 2 ( Sgol2 ) , which is involved in holding pairs of identical chromosomes together after the first round of division , has a bigger role than was previously realised . Sgol2 performs three other functions: it helps to align the chromosomes prior to division by , it is thought , facilitating the formation of the K-fibers that attach the microtubules to the chromosomes; it turns off the checkpoint that monitors the alignment of the chromosomes and the attachment of the microtubules; and it regulates a number of the enzymes involved in the process . The specific interactions that allow Sgol2 to perform these diverse functions in meiosis were also identified . Thus , Rattani et al . show that in linking so many essential processes throughout meiosis , Sgol2 appears to have a key , if not unique , role in determining the fate of chromosomes as cells divide .", "article": "Accurate chromosome segregation depends on coordination between cohesion resolution and kinetochore-microtubule interactions ( K-fibers ) , a process regulated by the spindle assembly checkpoint ( SAC ) . How these diverse processes are coordinated remains unclear . We show that in mammalian oocytes Shugoshin-like protein 2 ( Sgol2 ) in addition to protecting cohesin , plays an important role in turning off the SAC , in promoting the congression and bi-orientation of bivalents on meiosis I spindles , in facilitating formation of K-fibers and in limiting bivalent stretching . Sgol2\u2019s ability to protect cohesin depends on its interaction with PP2A , as is its ability to silence the SAC , with the latter being mediated by direct binding to Mad2 . In contrast , its effect on bivalent stretching and K-fiber formation is independent of PP2A and mediated by recruitment of MCAK and inhibition of Aurora C kinase activity respectively . By virtue of its multiple interactions , Sgol2 links many of the processes essential for faithful chromosome segregation . \n The production of haploid gametes from diploid germ cells depends on two rounds of chromosome segregation ( meiosis I and II ) without an intervening round of DNA replication . Defects during the first or second meiotic division in oocytes lead to formation of aneuploid eggs , which in humans occurs with a frequency between 10 and 30% and is a major cause of fetal miscarriages ( Hassold and Hunt , 2001 ) . Understanding the causes of meiotic chromosome missegregation will require clarifying not only the forces and regulatory mechanisms governing meiotic chromosome segregation but also how these are coordinated . At the heart of this process are two opposing forces . The pulling forces produced by kinetochore-microtubules attachments ( K-fibers ) and resisting forces generated by sister chromatid cohesion , which counteracts K-fiber forces if and when kinetochores attach to microtubules with different polarities . During meiosis I , cohesion along chromosome arms holds bivalent chromosomes together following the creation of chiasmata produced by reciprocal recombination between homologous non-sister chromatids . This cohesion must persist during the attachment of maternal and paternal kinetochores to microtubules from opposite poles ( bi-orientation ) and resist the resulting spindle forces . The degree of traction exerted by meiotic spindles must create sufficient tension to facilitate bi-orientation ( Tachibana-Konwalski et al . , 2010 ) . During the bi-orientation process , the initial attachment of kinetochores to the surface of the microtubule lattice ( lateral attachment ) is converted to attachments to their plus ends ( end on attachment ) , creating K-fibers . Because this process is intrinsically error prone , inappropriate attachments , for example those that connect maternal and paternal kinetochores to the same pole , must be disrupted through phosphorylation of kinetochore proteins by Aurora B/C kinases ( Kitajima et al . , 2011 ) . However , because these kinases disrupt K-fibers , they must subsequently be down regulated once bivalents bi-orient correctly . The first meiotic division is eventually triggered by activation of a gigantic ubiquitin protein ligase called the anaphase-promoting complex or cyclosome ( APC/C ) whose destruction of securin and cyclin B activates a thiol protease called separase that cleaves the kleisin subunit of the cohesin complex holding sister chromatids together ( McGuinness et al . , 2005; Kudo et al . , 2006 ) . This process converts chromosomes from bivalents to dyads . It is delayed until all bivalents have bi-oriented by the production , at kinetochores that have not yet come under tension , of a potent inhibitor of the APC/C called the mitotic checkpoint complex ( MCC ) whose Mad2 subunit binds tightly to the APC/C\u2019s Cdc20 co-activator protein . This regulatory mechanism , called the spindle assembly checkpoint ( SAC ) , must be turned off before APC/CCdc20 can direct destruction of securin and cyclin B and thereby activate separase . Another pre-condition for cleavage , at least in yeast , is phosphorylation of cohesin\u2019s kleisin subunit by a pair of protein kinases , namely CK1\u03b4/\u03b5 and DDK ( Ishiguro et al . , 2010; Katis et al . , 2010 ) . During the first meiotic division , cohesin is phosphorylated along chromosome arms but not at centromeres , which ensures that only cohesion along arms is destroyed by separase at the onset of anaphase I . The consequent persistence of cohesion at centromeres promotes bi-orientation of dyads during meiosis II . Centromeric cohesin avoids phosphorylation and therefore cleavage during the first meiotic division because separase activation is preceded by the recruitment to centromeres of orthologues of the Drosophila MEI-S332 protein , called shugoshins . Members of this family contain a conserved C-terminal basic region and an N-terminal homodimeric parallel coiled coil , which provides a docking site for protein phosphatase 2A\u2019s ( PP2A ) C and B\u2019 subunits ( Xu et al . , 2009 ) . In budding yeast , mutant proteins defective specifically in PP2A binding fail to confer protection of centromeric cohesion during meiosis I ( Xu et al . , 2009 ) . Mammals have two members of the shugoshin family: Shugoshin-like protein 1 ( Sgol1 ) , and Shugoshin-like protein 2 ( Sgol2 ) . The former prevents centromeric cohesin from a process called the \u2018prophase pathway\u2019 that removes cohesin from chromosomes by a non-proteolytic mechanism soon after cells enter mitosis ( McGuinness et al . , 2005; Liu et al . , 2013 ) . Sgol2 , on the other hand , protects centromeric cohesin from separase at the first meiotic division ( Lee et al . , 2008; Llano et al . , 2008 ) . Sgol2\u2019s coiled coil domain binds PP2A in vitro ( Xu et al . , 2009 ) but whether this is vital for protecting centromeric cohesion is not known . Sgol2 also interacts with MCAK ( Huang et al . , 2007 ) , a microtubule depolymerizing kinesin , implicated in correcting inappropriate kinetochore-microtubule interactions ( error correction ) , and with Mad2 an essential component of the MCC ( Orth et al . , 2011 ) . Shugoshins , though not explicitly Sgol2 , have also been implicated in recruiting to kinetochores the Aurora B kinase , necessary both for the SAC and for error correction ( Tsukahara et al . , 2010; Yamagishi et al . , 2010 ) . Based on its interactions , Sgol2 has been linked to cohesion protection , the spindle assembly checkpoint , and error correction pathways . However , the physiological significance of these multiple interactions remain unclear . We show here that Sgol2 defective in PP2A binding fails to protect centromeric cohesin , as found for Sgo1 in yeast ( Xu et al . , 2009 ) . However , if this were the sole function of Sgol2 , then chromosome behavior during meiosis I should be unaffected . To our surprise , we found that Sgol2 deficiency caused striking changes in chromosome and microtubule dynamics . It delayed bi-orientation of bivalents on meiosis I spindles , caused increased bivalent stretching , and greatly increased Aurora B/C kinase activity at kinetochores , which was accompanied by an increase in lateral and a decrease in end on kinetochore-microtubules attachments . Lastly , Sgol2 deficiency delayed considerably APC/CCdc20 activation , suggesting that it was required to shut off the SAC . Sgol2 helps to turn off the SAC by binding directly both PP2A and the MCC protein Mad2 , it moderates chromosome stretching by recruiting to kinetochores the kinesin MCAK , and likely promotes formation of K-fibers by down-regulating the activity of Aurora B/C kinase specifically at kinetochores . Meiotic chromosome segregation is a highly complex process dependent on an array of different biochemical processes . Our findings imply that through its multi-domain structure , Sgol2 has an important if not unique role in coordinating many of the key processes within this array . \n An essential feature of shugoshins is a conserved N-terminal homodimeric coiled coil that binds PP2A ( Figure 1A ) . Unlike Sgol1 , which only interacts stably with the PP2A holoenzyme ( a complex of A , B\u2019 and C subunits ) , Sgol2 also associates with a core complex containing only A and C subunits ( Xu et al . , 2009 ) . To create versions of Sgol2 defective specifically in binding PP2A , conserved residues ( namely L51 , N54 , R56 , and E82 ) predicted to interact directly with PP2A were substituted by alanine or in the case of E82 also by lysine ( Figure 1B ) . Likewise , the highly conserved asparagine ( N55 on Sgol2 ) , corresponding to N61 in Sgol1 , which forms a hydrogen bond within the coiled coil enabling it to adopt a conformation compatible with PP2A binding , was substituted by isoleucine ( Figure 1B ) . Importantly , binding between purified Flag- and His-tagged Sgol2 fragments spanning the coiled coil ( cc ) region ( 31\u2013117 ) was unaffected by any of these mutations , implying that all permit coiled coil formation . A triple mutation L51A/N54A/R56A ( 3A ) reduced dimerization modestly ( Figure 1D ) but this effect was not seen when the two proteins were co-expressed in bacteria ( Figure 1E ) . To assess the effects on PP2A binding , GST-tagged PP2A A subunit was incubated with B\u2019 and C subunits in the presence of MBP-Sgol2cc-Flag . Pull down experiments revealed that N55I and the 3A triple mutation abolished co-purification of Sgol2 with the GST-tagged A subunit while N54A and R56A reduced it . In contrast , L51A and E82A had little or no effect while E82K caused a modest reduction ( Figure 1F ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 01133 . 003Figure 1 .

Arrowheads below the alignment indicate conserved residues ( L51 , N54 , R56 , and E82 ) in the coiled coil domain of Sgol2 mapping onto binding sites between PP2A and Sgol1 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 01133 . 003 To investigate whether association of PP2A with Sgol2\u2019s coiled coil is necessary for protecting centromeric cohesion , we compared the effect of the mutations on PP2A\u2019s co-localization with Sgol2 at kinetochores with their effect on the maintenance of cohesion after oocytes have undergone the first meiotic division . Sgol2 and PP2A co-localize at inner kinetochores of bivalent chromosomes at metaphase I in wild type oocytes ( Figure 2A ) but neither protein was detected at this location in sgol2\u0394/\u0394 oocytes ( n = 26 ) . Importantly , microinjection of wild type Sgol2 encoding mRNA into sgol2\u0394/\u0394 oocytes restored accumulation at kinetochores of both Sgol2 and PP2A at metaphase I . In contrast , microinjection of mRNAs carrying N54A , N55I , or 3A mutations restored Sgol2 but not PP2A ( Figure 2A ) , implying that binding of PP2A to Sgol2\u2019s coiled coil is necessary for recruiting the phosphatase to kinetochores in vivo . Chromosome spreads revealed that the failure of sgol2\u0394/\u0394 oocytes to maintain cohesion between sister centromeres after meiosis I was reversed by microinjection of wild type but not N54A , N55I , or 3A mRNAs ( Figure 2B ) . L51A and E82A , which had little or no effect on PP2A\u2019s binding to Sgol2\u2019s coiled coil in vitro , also fully restored cohesion protection while R56A and E82K , which caused a modest reduction in the Sgol2cc-PP2A interaction vitro , only partially restored it , producing metaphase II oocytes containing individual chromatids as well as dyads ( Figure 2B ) . Lastly , we noticed that injection of 3A Sgol2 mRNAs also produced centromeric cohesion defects in wild type oocytes ( Figure 3A , B ) . The correlation between the effects of mutations on binding PP2A in vitro and on protecting cohesion in vivo implies that the interaction of PP2A with Sgol2\u2019s coiled coil is essential for protecting cohesin from separase at the first meiotic division . 10 . 7554/eLife . 01133 . 004Figure 2 .

( B ) Frequencies of dyads and single chromatids observed on metaphase II-stage chromosome spreads . Numbers of oocytes examined are indicated ( n ) .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 01133 . 005 DIC video microscopy revealed that sgol2\u0394/\u0394 oocytes extruded polar bodies on average 2 hr later than oocytes from wild type littermates . Moreover , only 61% of sgol2\u0394/\u0394 oocytes extruded the first polar body compared with 88% in wild type controls ( Figure 4A ) . To investigate this , wild type and sgol2\u0394/\u0394 oocytes were microinjected with mRNA encoding histone H2B-mCherry to mark chromosomes and Securin-eGFP to measure APC/CCdc20 activity ( Figure 4B ) . 40% of mutant oocytes failed to activate APC/CCdc20 compared to 12% in wild type controls ( Figure 4C ) , and those that did so were delayed by about 2 hr ( Figure 4D , Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . Surprisingly , microinjection of Sgol2 mRNA not only increased the fraction of oocytes that activated APC/CCdc20 to wild type levels ( 89% ) , but also advanced activation so that it took place about 2 hr earlier than in wild type ( Figure 4E\u2013G , Figure 4\u2014figure supplements 2 and 3 ) . Because microinjection of mRNA encoding a version of Cdc20 ( R132A ) that cannot bind Mad2 , but not wild type Cdc20 , induced securin destruction in all sgol2\u0394/\u0394 oocytes ( Figure 4C ) , we conclude that Sgol2 facilitates APC/CCdc20 activation by silencing the SAC and that this process is dose dependent . 10 . 7554/eLife . 01133 . 006Figure 4 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 01133 . 009 The recent observation that shugoshins , like Sgol2 from humans and Sgo1 from Xenopus , bind Mad2 in a manner similar to Mad1 and Cdc20 through a conserved Mad2 Interaction Motif ( MIM ) ( Orth et al . , 2011 ) provided a clue as to how Sgol2 might regulates the SAC . This motif is conserved in mouse Sgol2 ( Figure 1C ) and far-western blots confirmed that interaction between mSgol2 and Mad2 is weakened by substituting the basic amino acid at its center with alanine ( H150A ) or glutamic acid ( H150E ) ( Figure 1G ) . Strikingly , H150E and H150A Sgol2 mRNAs were less effective than wild type in increasing the fraction of sgol2\u0394/\u0394 oocytes that activated APC/CCdc20 ( Figure 4E ) . They also failed to advance the timing of activation ( Figure 4F , Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2B , C ) . Importantly , neither mutation affected Sgol2\u2019s association with kinetochores , its ability to recruit PP2A ( Figure 3C ) or MCAK ( Figure 5A ) to this location , or protection of centromeric cohesion ( Figure 3D ) . Interestingly , N54A , which reduces PP2A binding , also abrogated Sgol2\u2019s ability to promote APC/CCdc20 activation ( Figure 4E , F , Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2A , D ) without having any effect on MCAK recruitment ( Figure 5A ) . We conclude that Sgol2 has an important role in silencing the SAC during meiosis I by binding directly both to Mad2 and PP2A . 10 . 7554/eLife . 01133 . 010Figure 5 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 01133 . 012 We noticed that chiasmata appeared terminalized in a large fraction of bivalent chromosomes from sgol2\u0394/\u0394 oocytes ( Figure 5A ) . Because this effect was not accompanied by any reduction of cohesin along inter-chromatid axes ( Figure 5B ) , it is unlikely to be caused by precocious Rec8 cleavage . Live cell imaging of oocytes microinjected at the GV stage with mRNAs encoding H2B-mCherry and GFP-MCAK showed that maternal and paternal kinetochores were pulled further apart in sgol2\u0394/\u0394 oocytes at metaphase I ( t test , p<0 . 0001 ) . In other words , bivalents were stretched more and possibly the stretching of distal parts of bivalent chromosomes resulted in increased separation of homologous pairs on chromosome spreads . Importantly , increased kinetochore separation in sgol2\u0394/\u0394 oocytes was invariably observed on bivalents that had bi-oriented ( Figures 5C and 6; see also Videos 1 and 2 ) , but was not accompanied by any change in the overall length of metaphase I spindles ( ANOVA , p=0 . 97; Figure 5D ) . Interestingly , microinjection of Sgol2 mRNA not only rescued chiasmata structure ( Figure 5A ) , but also reduced inter-kinetochore distances to below that seen in wild type ( Figures 5C and 6; Video 3 , t test p<0 . 0001 ) , without altering spindle length ( Figure 5D ) . Because a similar reduction in inter-kinetochore distances was observed with N54A or H150E mutations ( Figures 5C and 6; Videos 4 and 5 , t test p<0 . 0001 ) , regulation of bivalent stretching by Sgol2 does not depend on its ability to bind PP2A or Mad2 . Thus , the effect cannot be due to changes either in arm cohesion protection or duration of metaphase I . 10 . 7554/eLife . 01133 . 013Figure 6 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 01133 . 019 Inter-kinetochore distances correlated inversely with GFP-MCAK signals at kinetochores . Thus , MCAK is missing from kinetochores in sgol2\u0394/\u0394 oocytes and more abundant ( even than wild type ) in mutant cells microinjected with Sgol2 mRNA ( Figures 5A , C and 6 ) . Because phosphorylation of human Sgol2 at T537 and T620 ( corresponding to T521 and T600 on M . m Sgol2 ) by Aurora B has been implicated in the association of MCAK with Sgol2 in mitotic cells ( Tanno et al . , 2010 ) , we tested the effect of AZD1152 , an Aurora B ( and C ) kinase inhibitor . This eliminated accumulation at kinetochores of both T521 phosphorylated Sgol2 ( Figure 7B ) and MCAK ( Figure 5A , Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . Crucially , injection of mRNA encoding T521A T600A Sgol2 into sgol2\u0394/\u0394 oocytes failed to restore accumulation of MCAK at kinetochores ( Figure 5A , Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1 ) and to reduce inter-kinetochore distances ( Figures 5C and 6; Video 6 , t test p=0 . 027 ) . Interestingly , neither the Aurora B/C inhibitor nor T521A T600A prevented MCAK\u2019s recruitment to chromosome arms ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . The effect of T521A T600A on MCAK\u2019s kinetochore binding was highly specific as the mutant Sgol2 protein still accumulated at kinetochores ( albeit to a lesser extent ) , recruited PP2A to this location , and protected centromeric cohesion from separase ( Figure 5E , F ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 01133 . 020Figure 7 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 01133 . 021 These observations suggest that bivalent stretching might be inhibited by recruitment of MCAK to kinetochores by Sgol2 . If so , increased inter-kinetochore distances in sgol2\u0394/\u0394 oocytes should be reduced by targeting MCAK to centromeres by artificial means , namely by expression of an MCAK protein whose N-terminus is fused to the C-terminus of CENPB-eGFP . Remarkably , CENPB-eGFP-MCAK , but not CENPB-eGFP , reduced inter-kinetochore distances ( Figure 5C , Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2; Video 7 , t test p<0 . 0001 ) . We conclude that Sgol2 moderates the pulling force exerted on bivalents by recruiting MCAK to kinetochores , a process dependent on phosphorylation of Sgol2 by Aurora B/C kinases . 10 . 7554/eLife . 01133 . 022Video 7 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 01133 . 022 The period between Germinal Vesicle Breakdown ( GVBD ) and anaphase can be divided according to the state of spindles and chromosomes into four distinct phases ( Schuh and Ellenberg , 2007; Kitajima et al . , 2011 ) . During phase 1 , multiple microtubule-organizing centers ( MTOCs ) form a ball of polymerizing microtubules on whose surface chromosomes are distributed individually . This is followed by a period ( phase 2 ) in which chromosomes slide laterally over the ball shaped spindle apparatus , eventually congressing to form a \u2018prometaphase\u2019 belt around it . During phase 3 , chromosomes invade the cluster of microtubules , which elongates along an axis perpendicular to the earlier chromosome belt , forming a barrel-shaped bipolar spindle . This highly dynamic phase culminates when chromosomes bi-orient on a metaphase plate within the bipolar spindle . During the fourth and final stage ( phase 4 ) , bi-oriented chromosomes oscillate around the metaphase plate with low amplitudes ( Phase 4 ) . Live-cell confocal imaging of wild type mouse oocytes microinjected with H2B-mCherry and GFP-MCAK showed that MCAK accumulates at MTOCs and on microtubules during phase 1 ( Figure 6; Video 1 ) but does not appear at kinetochores until chromosomes congress on the surface of the ball at the start of phase 2 . This event is accompanied by an increase in Sgol2\u2019s abundance at kinetochores and by phosphorylation of T521 ( Figure 7A , B ) . MCAK\u2019s abundance at kinetochores gradually increases during phase 3 as chromosomes invade the spindle apparatus and peaks as chromosomes bi-orient on the metaphase plate ( Figure 6 , top panel; Video 1 ) . This sequence of events is substantially altered in sgol2\u0394/\u0394 oocytes . Though GFP-MCAK co-localizes with MTOCs and microtubules , it never subsequently accumulates at kinetochores ( Figure 6 ) . Chromosomes associate with the surface of the ball , albeit more loosely than in wild type , and undergo visible stretching instead of forming a prometaphase belt ( Figures 6 and 8A , Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1; Video 2 ) . This excessive stretching becomes even more pronounced upon formation of bipolar spindles . Thus , the clear demarcation of congression during phase 2 and bi-orientation during phase 3 was largely absent . Microinjection of Sgol2 mRNAs into sgol2\u0394/\u0394 oocytes greatly accelerated both invasion of the ball by chromosomes and their bi-orientation , with the latter occurring even earlier than in wild type oocytes and before metamorphosis of the ball into a bipolar spindle ( Figures 6 and 8A , Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1; Video 3 ) . Thus , while loss of Sgol2 delays bi-orientation , the modest over-expression caused by mRNA microinjection accelerates this process . 10 . 7554/eLife . 01133 . 023Figure 8 . Sgol2 promotes bi-orientation of homologous chromosomes by increasing kinetochore-microtubule interactions . ( A ) To study the relative distributions of chromosomes on the ball shaped spindle , at 2\u20133 hr post-GVBD , oocytes were treated with Ca2+ buffer for 90 s and then fixed in 1% PFA .

At 6 hr post-GVBD , oocytes were fixed in 1% PFA were stained with anti-\u03b2-tubulin ( microtubules , green ) , CREST ( kinetochores , red ) , and DAPI ( chromosomes , blue ) . For Aurora B/C inhibition , oocytes harvested from Sgol2 knockout females were cultured in M16 medium for 4 hr . At 4 hr post-GVBD , oocytes were transferred to M16 medium supplemented with low concentration ( 20 nM ) of AZD1152 inhibitor . Oocytes were cultured until 6 hr post-GVBD and were then fixed in 1% PFA . Scale bars represent 5 \u03bcm . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 01133 . 023 Crucially , the precocious bi-orientation caused by Sgol2 mRNA injection was unaffected by N54A or by H150E mutations but abrogated by T521A T600A ( Figures 6 and 8A , Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1; Videos 4 , 5 , 6 ) , which also abolished MCAK\u2019s accumulation at kinetochores and compromised chromosome alignment ( Figures 5A and 6 , Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1 ) , possibly due to increased association of MCAK with the arms of bivalent chromosomes ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . Injection of Sgol2 T521A T600A still advanced polar body extrusion ( Figure 6 ) , demonstrating that SAC silencing by Sgol2 does not depend on rapid or possibly even accurate chromosome bi-orientation and suggesting that these activities are mediated by separate domains within Sgol2 . Surprisingly , injection of mRNAs encoding CENPB-eGFP-MCAK instead of Sgol2 did not accelerate chromosome bi-orientation ( data not shown ) , raising the possibility that Sgol2 facilitates bi-orientation by a mechanism either independent of or in addition to MCAK\u2019s recruitment to kinetochores . Because , bi-orientation of bivalent chromosomes correlates with the appearance of kinetochore-microtubule bundles ( Kitajima et al . , 2011 ) , we visualized these in oocytes fixed in 1% PFA following a brief treatment with a calcium-containing buffer , which destabilizes the more dynamic non-kinetochore-microtubules . This revealed three differences between wild type and sgol2\u0394/\u0394 oocytes at 6 hr post-GVBD , when most kinetochores in wild type have relinquished lateral and formed end on attachments and chromosomes have bi-oriented . Kinetochore associated microtubules bundles ( K-fibers ) were thinner and more sparse , lateral attachments were greatly increased in frequency , and kinetochores ( as detected by CREST antibodies ) were frequently highly stretched in mutant oocytes ( Figure 8B ) . Microinjection of Sgol2 mRNA had the opposite effect , eliminating lateral attachments and kinetochore stretching while greatly increasing the abundance of end-on microtubules associated with each kinetochore , an effect abrogated by T521A T600A ( Figure 8B ) . This suggests that the accumulation at kinetochores of Sgol2 phosphorylated by Aurora B/C kinase stimulates the conversion of lateral to end on attachments and that this may be the mechanism by which Sgol2 accelerates chromosome bi-orientation . Because injection of CENPB-eGFP-MCAK mRNAs instead of Sgol2 largely failed to increase end-on attachments at the expense of lateral ones ( Figure 8B ) , we suspect that Sgol2 phosphorylated by Aurora B/C has a function at kinetochores besides MCAK recruitment ( see below ) . Because Aurora B kinase destabilizes kinetochore-microtubule attachments , at least partly by phosphorylating proteins within the KMN network ( Welburn et al . , 2010 ) , we tested whether Sgol2 altered the phosphorylation of Ser24 on Knl1 ( p-Knl1 ) . Remarkably , the ratio of p-Knl1 to CREST signals in sgol2\u0394/\u0394 oocytes at 6 hr post-GVBD was more than double that of wild type controls ( Figure 9A ) . Microinjection of Sgol2 mRNA reduced this to below wild type , an effect unaltered by N54A but largely abolished by T521A T600A ( Figure 9A ) . Similar results were obtained using a phospho-specific antibody against Ser100 on Dsn1 ( data not shown ) and one that detects activating auto-phosphorylation of Aurora A/B/C at Thr288 , Thr232 , or Thr198 ( p-Aurora ) , respectively ( Figure 9B ) . Interestingly , these effects were specific to kinetochores as auto-phosphorylation of Aurora B/C on chromosome arms was unaltered in the mutant oocytes ( Figure 9B ) . Importantly , Sgol2 did not alter the overall amount of Aurora C at kinetochores ( Figure 10 ) . These results imply that Sgol2 counters phosphorylation of KMN network proteins by a mechanism not involving its recruitment of PP2A . Strangely , this process seems to depend on Sgol2\u2019s prior phosphorylation by the very same kinases that it ultimately inhibits . In other words , Aurora B/C creates its own inhibitor at kinetochores , creating a negative feedback loop . Consistent with this notion , the gradual accumulation at kinetochores of Sgol2 phosphorylated at T521 following GVBD ( Figure 7B ) is accompanied by a corresponding reduction in Dsn1 Ser100 phosphorylation ( Figure 9D ) . Critically , Sgol2\u2019s ability to inhibit Aurora B/C kinase activity at kinetochores does not depend on kinetochore-microtubule interactions , as Sgol2 reduced auto-phosphorylation of Aurora B/C even in the presence of microtubule destabilizing drug ( Figure 9C ) . To address whether hyper-activity of Aurora B/C at kinetochores could be responsible for the paucity of K-fibers in sgol2\u0394/\u0394 oocytes , we tested the effect of the Aurora kinase inhibitor AZD1152 . This both increased the density of K-fibers and reduced kinetochore stretching but did not eliminate lateral attachments ( Figure 8B ) , which may require direct involvement of MCAK . We suggest that Sgol2 promotes chromosome bi-orientation by inhibiting Aurora B/C kinase as well as by recruiting MCAK . 10 . 7554/eLife . 01133 . 024Figure 9 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 01133 . 025 \n Previous work has shown that Sgol2 is essential for protection of centromeric cohesin from separase at the first meiotic division ( Lee et al . , 2008; Llano et al . , 2008 ) . Our creation and analysis of mutations within Sgol2\u2019s highly conserved coiled coil reveals the likely mechanism , namely recruitment of PP2A to centromeres . PP2A might protect cohesin from separase either directly , by binding ( Holland et al . , 2007 ) and inhibiting separase activity , or indirectly , by reversing phosphorylation of cohesin\u2019s Rec8 subunit ( Katis et al . , 2010 ) , a process known to be important for its cleavage in yeast . However , if cohesion protection were Sgol2\u2019s sole function , then its depletion should not compromise chromosome segregation during meiosis I . The precocious loss of cohesion should only affect the second meiotic division . On the contrary , depletion of Sgol2 specifically in oocytes has highly pleiotropic consequences already during meiosis I . These include inefficient SAC silencing , greatly increased bivalent stretching , and major alterations in the dynamics of kinetochore-microtubule attachments ( K-fibers ) . We show that Sgol2 silences the SAC by binding to Mad2 using a similar MIM motif common to Mad2\u2019s other two partners Cdc20 and Mad1 . This raises the possibility that Sgol2 silences the SAC by competing with Cdc20 for the binding of activated Mad2 , thereby preventing formation of the MCC . However , this cannot be the full story as SAC silencing also depends on Sgol2\u2019s ability to bind PP2A . Because Sgol2\u2019s MIM motif is close to the coiled coil by which it binds PP2A , it is conceivable that PP2A directly ( i . e . , structurally ) facilitates the formation or stability of \u2018closed\u2019 complexes between Sgol2 and Mad2 . This hypothesis is supported by the fact that only dephosphorylated Mad2 interacts with Cdc20 and Sgol2 , while a phosphomimetic mutant of Mad2 cannot associate with either of these proteins ( personal communication Michael Orth ) . Thus , PP2A could selectively stabilize the Sgol2-Mad2 complex by keeping Mad2 in a de-phosphorylated state . Therefore , it is conceivable that if there were sufficient turnover of Mad2 bound to MCC , then PP2A could promote the Sgol2: Mad2 complex formation and thus alter the activity of the MCC responsible for inhibiting the APC/C . Unlike centromeric protection and SAC silencing , Sgol2\u2019s regulation of bivalent stretching depends not on its ability to bind PP2A but instead on phosphorylation at T521 and T600 by Aurora B/C kinases . This facilitates MCAK accumulation at kinetochores . Because artificial recruitment of MCAK to kinetochores by fusion to CENP-B substitutes for Sgol2 with regard to bivalent stretching , we suggest that it is the population of MCAK recruited to kinetochores by Sgol2 that moderates the pulling forces exerted on maternal and paternal kinetochores , possibly by reducing the incidence of lateral attachments . Artificial MCAK recruitment did not however restore normal looking end on attachments or greatly facilitate bi-orientation in Sgol2 deficient oocytes , implying that Sgol2 has yet another function at kinetochores besides recruiting PP2A and MCAK . Our observation that auto-phosphorylation of Aurora B/C kinases as well as phosphorylation of KMN proteins are elevated in Sgol2\u2019s absence but depressed upon microinjection of Sgol2 mRNA suggests that this other function of Sgol2 is to act as a kinetochore-specific inhibitor of Aurora B/C kinases . The notion that Sgol2 moderates Aurora B/C kinase activity at kinetochores was unexpected , as it has been reported that xSgo2 , a newly discovered homolog of shugoshin in Xenopus , actually promotes Aurora Kinase activity , generating a favourable environment for microtubule polymerization ( Rivera et al . , 2012 ) . In this case , the effect may be systemic , that is throughout the cytoplasm , whereas M . m Sgol2 appears to act as an inhibitor only at kinetochores . A remarkable feature of this effect is that Sgol2\u2019s ability to inhibit Aurora B/C kinases at kinetochores depends on its prior phosphorylation at T521 and T600 by the very same Aurora kinases . In other words , Aurora B/C kinase creates its own inhibitor , generating a negative feedback loop . Whether the phosphorylation of Sgol2 necessary for it to act as an inhibitor of Aurora kinases at kinetochores is also generated at this location or along chromosome arms or elsewhere in the cell is currently unclear . Irrespective of its precise spatial and dynamic properties , this negative feedback loop may be an important feature of meiosis I . Aurora B/C protein kinases have a key role in destabilizing inappropriate kinetochore-microtubule attachments , namely those that do not generate tension ( Lampson and Cheeseman , 2011 ) . They are therefore essential for the efficient bi-orientation of bivalent chromosomes . However , it is important that the de-stabilization process is eventually turned off so that correctly attached bivalents remain stably attached to microtubules . Hitherto , it has been assumed that the mechanism responsible for turning off these kinases merely involved physical forces that pull Aurora substrates away from the enzymes when maternal and paternal kinetochores are pulled in opposite directions ( Liu et al . , 2009 ) . Though our work does not preclude a role for traction in down regulating Aurora B/C\u2019s access to kinetochore-bound substrates , it raises the possibility that down regulation is also an intrinsic feature of a biochemical system in which Aurora B/C activates its own inhibitor . The regulatory network revealed by our work ensures that Aurora B/C kinases will be active early during the bi-orientation , when incorrect attachments may be more frequent , and less active later , when they have been largely eliminated . It is possible that during the period when Aurora B/C kinases are active , the selective stabilization of correct attachments is mediated by mechanical changes within kinetochores induced by tension , as recently observed in purified yeast kinetochores ( Akiyoshi et al . , 2010 ) , not as originally thought by tension dependent changes in Aurora kinase activity , for which there has never been much direct evidence . We suggest that an important feature of meiosis I in oocytes is an early phase of high Aurora B/C kinase activity at kinetochores followed by a later phase of lowered activity made possible by the Aurora B/C-Sgol2 negative feedback loop . The lowered activity of Aurora B/C might increase the MT-depolymerizing activity of MCAK at kinetochores ( Andrews et al . , 2004 ) . This is supported by the fact that the kinetochore pool of MCAK , recruited by Sgol2 , is indeed not phosphorylated at serine 92 in mouse oocytes ( data not shown ) . If correct , it will be important to understand the dynamic properties of the feedback loop that ensures that Aurora B/C kinases do not turn themselves off precociously . It is currently unclear whether the Aurora B/C-shugoshin feedback loop is a general feature of meiotic cells or whether it is also a feature of mitotic cells . How Sgol2 inhibits Aurora B/C kinase activity at kinetochores is also unclear , in particular whether Sgol2 does this alone or only in conjunction with the recruitment of MCAK . Given the number of fundamental processes regulated by Sgol2 , it is surprising that sgol2\u0394/\u0394 oocytes often manage to undergo the first meiotic division without generating massive aneuploidy . Their second meiotic division is of course completely defective due to the total absence of sister chromatid cohesion . We suggest that all of the processes regulated by Sgol2 are fundamentally essential but that they are also regulated by Sgol2-independent pathways . In other words , the processes regulated by Sgol2 may be so fundamental that there are multiple pathways regulating them . It is not inconceivable that Sgol1 , which is also expressed during meiosis , shares some functions with Sgol2 and it will therefore be interesting to analyze the phenotype of double mutant oocytes . What is possibly most remarkable is that a single protein regulates sister chromatid cohesion , chromosome traction , the spindle assembly checkpoint , and lastly Aurora B/C kinases . Crucially , by demonstrating that different point mutations alter the regulation of some but not other processes , we have proven that the pleiotropy observed in sgol2\u0394/\u0394 oocytes is not due to knock on effects ( secondary or even tertiary pathology ) of eliminating a single function . Sgol2 possesses several different domains that regulate fundamentally different processes ( Figure 11 ) . Why so much regulation is embedded into a single protein is unclear , but we speculate that this helps the coordination of multiple processes necessary for high fidelity chromosome segregation . 10 . 7554/eLife . 01133 . 026Figure 11 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 01133 . 026 \n Generation of the Sgol2 knockout mice has been described ( Llano et al . , 2008 ) . To detect Rec8 , females from a transgenic line expressing Rec8 from a bacterial artificial chromosome ( BAC ) , with nine tandem copies of the human c-myc epitope at its C terminus , were crossed to sgol2\u0394/+ males . Litters with genotypes sgol2\u0394/+ ( Tg ) Rec8- Myc+ were crossed back to sgol2\u0394/+ mice to generate sgol2\u0394/+ ( Tg ) Rec8-Myc+ ( controls ) and sgol2\u0394/\u0394 ( Tg ) Rec8-Myc+ female . Prophase-arrested oocytes were harvested from ovaries excised from 8\u201312 week old female mice . Antral follicles were isolated using sterile insulin needles in M2 medium ( Sigma-Aldrich , UK ) supplemented with 200 \u00b5M IBMX ( Sigma-Aldrich ) . For intracellular microinjections , oocytes were placed in droplets of M2 medium with IBMX . For time-lapse confocal imaging and in vitro culture prior to preparation of chromosome spreads , oocytes were transferred into IBMX-free M16 medium and cultured at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 . Capped mRNA constructs with a poly-A tail were transcribed using T3 or T7 Ultra mMESSAGE kit ( Ambion , Austin , TX , USA ) from plasmid cDNA encoding H2B-mCherry , wild type Sgol2 ( Origene , Rockville , MD , USA ) , and various mutants of Sgol2 , GFP-Sgol2 , Securin-eGFP , GFP-MCAK , CENPB-eGFP , CENPB-eGFP-MCAK , and GFP-EB3 . Fully-grown oocytes were injected with 5\u201310 pl mRNA at a final concentration of 0 . 1 mg/ml in RNase-free water ( Ambion ) using a Pneumatic PicoPump ( World Precision Instruments ) . To allow for protein expression , following microinjection of mRNA , GV oocytes were cultured for 12 hr in M16 supplemented with IBMX . Oocytes were then washed in inhibitor-free M16 and thereafter cultured at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 . During time-lapse confocal microscopy experiments , oocytes were cultured in a PeCon environmental microscope incubator at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 . A Zeiss LSM510 META confocal microscope equipped with PC-Apochromat 63x/1 . 2 NA water immersion and PC-Apochromat 20x/0 . 8 NA objective lenses was used for image acquisition . For detection of GFP and mCherry , 488-nm and 561-nm excitation wavelengths and BP 505\u2013550 and LP 575 filters were used . During live-cell imaging , chromosomes labeled with H2B-mCherry were tracked with an EMBL-developed tracking macro ( Rabut and Ellenberg , 2004 ) adapted to our microscope . We imaged 8 to 16 z-confocal sections ( every 1 . 5 or 2 . 0 \u00b5m ) at 5\u201310 min intervals for 12\u201314 hr . Chromosome spreads from mouse oocytes were prepared as previously described ( Peters et al . , 1997; Hodges and Hunt , 2002 ) . Briefly , zona pellucida was removed by treatment with 10 mg/ml Pronase ( Sigma-Aldrich ) at 37\u00b0C for 5\u201310 min . Zona-free oocytes were transferred to hypotonic solution ( 50% FCS in deionized water ) for 10 min at 37\u00b0C . Oocytes were then fixed in paraformaldehyde solution ( 1% paraformaldehyde , 0 . 15% Triton X-100 , 3 mM dithiothreitol , adjusted to pH 9 . 2 with NaOH ) in 15-well multichamber glass slide ( MP Biomedicals ) overnight at room temperature in a humidified chamber . After drying , slides were washed twice in 0 . 4% Photoflo/H2O ( Kodak ) and PBS for 5 min , at room temperature . Slides were then processed for immunostaining . In this study , we used CREST ( 1:250; Davis Lab , Davis , CA , USA ) , rabbit anti-Sgol2 serum ( 1:50; gift from JL Barbero [Parra et al . , 2009] ) , anti-phospho T521 Sgol2 ( 1:500 , gift from Yoshi Watanabe [Tanno et al . , 2010] ) , anti-MCAK ( 1:500 , gift from Duane A Compton [Mack and Compton , 2001] ) , anti-phospho S24 Knl1 ( 1:1000 , gift from Iain Cheeseman [Welburn et al . , 2010] ) , anti-phospho S100 Dsn1 ( 1:500 , gift from Iain Cheeseman [Welburn et al . , 2010] ) , antibody detecting T288 , T232 or T198 on Aurora A/B/C ( 1:50 , Cell Signaling Technology , Danvers , MA , USA ) , anti-Aurora C ( 1:50 , Bethly Laboratories , Montgomery , TX , USA ) , mouse anti-PP2A-C ( 1:200 , BD Biosciences , Palo Alto , CA , USA ) , and anti-c-Myc ( 1:500 , Millipore , Billerica , MA , USA ) . For analysis of K-fibers , oocytes were processed as previously described ( Kitajima et al . , 2011 ) . Briefly , after either 2 or 6 hr post-GVBD , oocytes were treated for 90 s with Ca2+ buffer ( 100 mM PIPES pH 7:0 , 1 mM MgCl2 , 0 . 1 mM CaCl2 , 0 . 1% Triton X-100 ) at 37\u00b0C and then fixed in 1% formaldehyde prepared in Ca2+ buffer for 30 min at room temperature . Following fixation , oocytes were washed and extracted overnight in PBT ( PBS supplemented with 0 . 1% Triton X-100 ) at 4\u00b0C . Cells were then blocked in 3% BSA with PBT ( blocking solution ) for 1 hr at room temperature . For immuno-labeling oocytes were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with \u03b2-tubulin ( 1:250 , Abcam , Cambridge , UK ) and CREST ( 1:100 , Davis Lab , Davis , CA , USA ) antibodies , prepared in blocking solution . After four washes in PBT , oocytes were incubated for 1 hr at room temperature with Alexa 488 and 568 conjugated secondary antibodies ( 1:500 , Invitrogen , UK ) prepared in blocking solution . Oocytes were briefly stained with Hoechst 33 , 342 ( 20 mg/ml ) before confocal imaging . Recombinant MBP-Sgol2cc-His and MBP-Sgol2cc-Flag were purified from 1l of Escherichia coli BL21 ( DE3 ) RIPL ( Stratagene , La Jolla , CA , USA ) carrying corresponding expression cassettes in pMAL-c2x- ( Flag-tagged subunit ) and pET28b-based backbones ( His-tagged subunit ) , grown at 37\u00b0C in 2xTY media supplemented with 25 \u03bcg/ml chloramphenicol and 100 \u03bcg/ml ampicillin for pMAL-c2x or 50 \u03bcg/ml kanamycin for pET28b . At OD600 = 0 . 4 , MBP-Sgol2cc-His or -Flag synthesis was induced at 30\u00b0C by the addition of 0 . 1 mM IPTG . After 4 hr , the cells were harvested by centrifugation , frozen in dry ice , and stored at \u221280\u00b0C . The cell paste was re-suspended in 40 ml of lysis buffer ( 50 mM sodium phosphate pH 7 . 0 , 500 mM NaCl , 10% glycerol , 0 . 02% Triton X-100 ) containing Roche complete EDTA free protease inhibitor , 1 mM PMSF and , for the His-tagged subunit 5 mM . Each aliquot was sonicated four times for 30 s on ice . Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 25 , 000 rpm for 1 hr at 4\u00b0C in a Beckman Coulter Avanti-J26XP JLA8 . 1000 rotor . The supernatant was incubated for 2 hr at 4\u00b0C on a 5 ml Talon column ( BD Biosciences , Palo Alto , CA , USA ) or ANTI-FLAG M2 Affinity Gel ( Sigma A2220 ) . The M2 Flag beads were washed four times with 50 ml of lysis buffer and the Talon beads were washed two times with 50 ml of lysis buffer containing 20 mM imidazole and two times with 50 ml of lysis buffer containing 45 mM imidazole . MBP-Sgol2cc-Flag was eluted with four times 1 ml of lysis buffer containing 3 \u00d7 FLAG peptide ( 150 ng/\u03bcl ) . MBP-Sgol2cc-His was eluted with 10 ml of lysis buffer containing 1 M of imidazole . The concentration of MBP-Sgol2cc-His and MBP-Sgol2cc-Flag were determined by nanodrop against the lysis solution . For all binding assays , highly-purified PP2A subunits ( purified as previously described [Cho and Xu , 2007] ) and MBP-Sgol2cc-Flag were used . To test the binding of PP2A to mutant shugoshin , 20 \u03bcg of GST-tagged PP2A A subunit were incubated with excess amounts of PP2A B56- and C- subunit and MBP-tagged shugoshin for 1 hr on ice . Subsequently , samples were incubated with 40 \u03bcl of glutathione beads ( GE Healthcare ) for 20 min . Beads were then washed 4 \u00d7 with 1 ml each of 1 \u00d7 PBS , 0 . 1% Triton X-100 , 1 mM dithiothreitol , boiled in reducing SDS loading buffer , and subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis followed by Coomassie blue staining .

{"lay_summary": "The nervous system contains billions of cells called neurons that connect to each other to form complex networks via junctions known as synapses . Synapses form between the end of an elongated section ( called the axon ) of one neuron and the tiny projections ( or dendrites ) from the cell body of the next neuron . Throughout the lifespan of an animal , the nervous system responds to experiences and stimuli from the environment by changing the strength of the connections at synapses; this is known as \u2018synaptic plasticity\u2019 . In this way , long-term information about learning and memory can be stored and used to direct future responses to similar situations . Many proteins are involved in forming and altering synapses . The genes that code for these proteins are found in the nucleus of the neuron within the cell body . To make new proteins , copies of genes are made using molecules called mRNAs , which then leave the nucleus and are used as templates by the machinery that assemble proteins . Previous studies have shown that mRNA molecules are transported from the cell body to the axon and dendrites , but it is not clear exactly where the proteins are produced . Kim et al . have now studied the movement of mRNAs in neurons from the sea slug Aplysia during synapse formation and synapse plasticity . This showed that mRNAs are delivered equally throughout the neuron , and so it appears that mRNAs are not targeted to a particular synapse . However , the level of protein production using these mRNA molecules is much higher in places where synapses are being formed or altered . A protein called netrin-1 promotes protein production in the dendrites of neurons at these synapses . Kim et al . demonstrate that although mRNAs are delivered throughout the neuron , they are only used to make proteins at specific synapses . This allows the entire neuron to be in a state of readiness to make new synapses or alter existing ones in response to stimuli from the environment . Understanding more about how this local control of protein production works within neurons may provide new insights into diseases that affect synaptic plasticity .", "article": "The persistence of experience-dependent changes in brain connectivity requires RNA localization and protein synthesis . Previous studies have demonstrated a role for local translation in altering the structure and function of synapses during synapse formation and experience-dependent synaptic plasticity . In this study , we ask whether in addition to promoting local translation , local stimulation also triggers directed trafficking of RNAs from nucleus to stimulated synapses . Imaging of RNA localization and translation in cultured Aplysia sensory-motor neurons revealed that RNAs were delivered throughout the arbor of the sensory neuron , but that translation was enriched only at sites of synaptic contact and/or synaptic stimulation . Investigation of the mechanisms that trigger local translation revealed a role for calcium-dependent retrograde netrin-1/DCC receptor signaling . Spatially restricting gene expression by regulating local translation rather than by directing the delivery of mRNAs from nucleus to stimulated synapses maximizes the readiness of the entire neuronal arbor to respond to local cues . \n Synapse formation and long-lasting experience-dependent synaptic plasticity require new RNA and protein synthesis ( Kandel , 2001; Kalinovsky and Scheiffele , 2004 ) . Neurons are dramatically polarized and compartmentalized cells , elaborating axonal and dendritic processes that extend long distances and forming thousands of synaptic connections with other neurons . This polarity and compartmentalization poses challenges to the spatial regulation of gene expression during synapse formation and synaptic plasticity: how can the products of gene expression be restricted to specific synapses undergoing activity-dependent changes in structure and function ? Many studies have demonstrated that mRNAs that constitutively localize to axonal growth cones in immature neurons and to dendrites in mature neurons undergo stimulus-induced translation , demonstrating that regulated translation of localized mRNAs provides one mechanism of spatially restricting neuronal gene expression ( Aakalu et al . , 2001; Job and Eberwine , 2001; Leung et al . , 2006; Lyles et al . , 2006; Smith et al . , 2005; Tsokas et al . , 2005; Wang et al . , 2009; Zheng et al . , 2001 ) . Here , we set out to determine whether , in addition to regulating compartmentalized translation , local stimulation also regulates RNA trafficking from the soma to the synapse . We considered that the regulated trafficking of stimulus-induced transcripts from nucleus to stimulated synapse would provide a means of directly coupling the requirement for transcription with the requirement for local translation during synapse formation and plasticity . A number of findings indicate that the persistence of long-term plasticity requires not only translation but also transcription . For example , transcriptional inhibitors block late-phase LTP of rodent hippocampal synapses ( Frey et al . , 1996; Nguyen et al . , 1994 ) and long-term facilitation ( LTF ) of Aplysia sensory-motor synapses ( Montarolo et al . , 1986 ) , indicating that translation of pre-existing localized mRNAs is not sufficient for late-LTP in hippocampus or for the persistence of LTF in Aplysia . Similarly , when isolated Aplysia sensory neurites , severed from their somata , are paired with motor neurons , they undergo a form of serotonin ( 5HT ) -induced LTF that does not last as long as the LTF in cultures containing intact SNs ( Grabham et al . , 2005 ) . Together these studies demonstrate that newly transcribed mRNAs are required for persistent synaptic plasticity . This led us to ask whether , in addition to regulating local translation , synaptic stimulation regulates the trafficking of RNAs from the nucleus to specific subcellular sites . Consistent with the possibility of stimulus-induced control of RNA trafficking , previous studies have reported that activity can regulate the localization of mRNAs within neurons . For example , depolarization has been shown to increase the dendritic localization of several mRNAs , including those encoding beta-actin ( Tiruchinapalli et al . , 2003 ) , BDNF , and TrkB ( Tongiorgi et al . , 1997 ) , while incubation with DHPG has been shown to increase the dendritic localization of the AMPA glutamate receptor GluA2 ( Grooms et al . , 2006 ) . Similarly , neurotrophins have been reported to regulate the concentration of specific mRNAs in axons of regenerating adult sensory neurons ( Willis et al . , 2007 ) . Neuronal activity also induces transcription of genes whose transcripts are subsequently transported into dendrites , including for example the immediate early gene Arc ( Link et al . , 1995; Lyford et al . , 1995 ) . In situ hybridization images of the bclw transcript in a recent study from Cosker et al ( 2013 ) indicated that the mRNA localized to peripheral but not central axons of DRG neurons , suggesting that neurons are capable of directing transcripts from the soma to subsets of processes . Together , these findings suggest that RNAs may undergo activity-dependent transport from the nucleus to locally stimulated subcellular compartments . In this study , we directly monitored RNA targeting from the soma to stimulated synapses during synapse formation and synaptic plasticity . To examine synapse formation , we cultured a single bifurcated Aplysia SN with a target ( L7 ) MN , with which it formed glutamatergic synapses , and a non-target ( L11 ) MN , with which it fasciculated but did not form chemical synapses ( Glanzman et al . , 1990 ) . To study RNA localization during synapse-specific plasticity , we cultured bifurcated SNs with two target MNs and locally perfused 5HT onto the connection with one MN to produce synapse-specific LTF . We asked whether and how stimuli regulate RNA and protein localization and concentration by analyzing the distribution of ribosomal RNA ( rRNA ) , messenger RNA ( mRNA ) , RNA binding proteins , and translation factors . We found that rRNA , three specific mRNAs , ribosomal proteins , and translation factors were delivered throughout the SN , to both synaptic and non-synaptic sites , but that translation was significantly enriched at sites of synaptic contact and at sites of synaptic stimulation . These results indicate that the spatial regulation of gene expression in Aplysia sensory-motor neurons is mediated primarily at the level of translation rather than at the level of RNA targeting from the nucleus . These results , together with our previous study ( Wang et al . , 2009 ) suggested the existence of a trans-synaptic signal that promotes translation of localized mRNAs . In investigating the nature of such a trans-synaptic signal , we uncovered a role for netrin-1/DCC signaling in local translation at synapses . Our findings are thus consistent with neurons delivering transcripts and translational machinery throughout the neuron , but with a synaptically restricted netrin-1-dependent signal triggering localized translation at synapses . \n We first asked whether the most abundant RNA , ribosomal RNA ( rRNA ) underwent directed targeting from neuronal cell bodies to synaptic sites during synapse formation . Towards this end , we performed fluorescent in situ hybridization ( FISH ) for 18S and 28S rRNA in cultures ( 3DIV ) containing a bifurcated SN contacting a target L7 MN , with which it formed glutamatergic synapses , and a non-target L11 MN , with which it fasciculated but did not form chemical synapses ( Figure 1A and Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A ) . Quantification of 18S ( Figure 1B , C ) and 28S ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B , C ) RNA in the proximal SN branches did not reveal any significant difference in concentration in the branch contacting the L7 target MN and the branch contacting the L11 non-target MN . We also examined the distribution of ribosomes by expressing the Aplysia ribosomal protein S6 tagged with the fluorescent tag dendra2 in bifurcated SNs contacting both target L7 and non-target L11 MNs ( Figure 1D ) . This allowed us to detect the ribosomal protein S6 in distal SNs without any signal from the MN ( in the rRNA FISH experiments , we focused on proximal SN processes in order to avoid confounding signal from the MNs ) . As shown in Figure 1E , F , S6-dendra2 targeted equally to distal SN branches contacting target or non-target MNs . Together , these data indicate that ribosomes are delivered throughout the SN and are not targeted specifically from the soma to branches receiving synaptogenic signals . 10 . 7554/eLife . 04158 . 003Figure 1 . rRNA targets equally well to SN branches contacting target and non-target MNs .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 04158 . 004 As a candidate localized mRNA , we first examined the transcript encoding the SN-specific neuropeptide sensorin , which not only localizes to distal sensory neurites but also concentrates at synapses . Since sensorin is only expressed in SNs , we could visualize sensorin mRNA in proximal and distal neurites without any background signal from MNs . We have previously shown that the neuritic and synaptic localization of sensorin mRNA are mediated by distinct signals ( Meer et al . , 2012; Wang et al . , 2009 ) and that sensorin mRNA undergoes localized translation at synapses during 5HT-mediated LTF ( Wang et al . 2009 ) . FISH for sensorin mRNA in 3DIV cultures revealed that the sensorin transcript localized equally to both proximal ( Figure 2D ) and distal ( Figure 2B , C ) branches of bifurcated sensory neurons contacting L7 or L11 MNs . The pattern of sensorin mRNA in distal branches was distinct , with diffuse distribution of sensorin mRNA in branches contacting non-target MNs and punctate concentrations of sensorin RNA at SN synapses onto target MNs ( see Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A for quantification of coefficient of variation ) . However , the same amount of RNA was present in both SN branches . Similar results were observed when we performed FISH analysis on 1DIV cultures ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B , D ) . These findings are consistent with a lack of directed targeting of sensorin mRNA from soma to branches receiving synaptogenic signals , although there is local redistribution of sensorin mRNA within the neuronal process at synaptic sites . 10 . 7554/eLife . 04158 . 005Figure 2 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 04158 . 007 We also examined the distribution of the mRNA encoding \u03b2-thymosin , which we had previously identified as a localized mRNA in Aplysia SNs ( Moccia et al . , 2003 ) . Since \u03b2-thymosin is expressed in both SN and MN , we examined its localization in proximal SN processes . As shown in Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2 , \u03b2-thymosin mRNA was distributed equally well in SN branches contacting L7 target and L11 non-target MNs . To assay the localization of an activity-dependent transcript , we performed in situ hybridization for EF1\u03b1 . EF1\u03b1 was expressed at very low levels in unstimulated neurons and was distributed equally well between L7 target and L11 non-target branches ( Figure 3A , B ) . Its expression was significantly induced following five spaced bath applications of ( 5HT ) , as previously described ( Giustetto et al . , 2003 ) . As shown in Figure 3C , D , we found that equal amounts of 5HT-induced EF1\u03b1 were delivered to SN branches contacting L7 target and L11 non-target MNs . These results indicate that activity-induced transcripts are not delivered preferentially from the nucleus towards a synaptic target . 10 . 7554/eLife . 04158 . 008Figure 3 . EF1\u03b1 mRNA is induced by 5x5HT and is delivered throughout the neuronal arbor . A bifurcated SN was cultured with an L7 target MN and an L11 non-target MN ( A and B ) for 3 days . Alexa647 ( cyan ) was microinjected into the SN before imaging to visualize SN processes . On day 3 , cultures were stimulated with 5 bath applications of 5HT to induce long-term facilitation ( LTF ) ( B ) , or mock stimulated with 5 bath applications of artificial seawater ( ASW , the vehicle ) as controls ( A ) . Four hours later , cultures were processed for Fluorescent In Situ Hybridization ( FISH ) for EF1\u03b1 mRNA . Areas in proximal SN neurites outlined with white squares in low magnification DIC image on the left were imaged at high magnification to visualize EF1\u03b1 mRNA FISH signal . The increase in EF1\u03b1 mRNA FISH signal in ( B ) as compared to ( A ) indicates that EF1\u03b1 mRNA was induced by bath application of 5x5HT , as described in Giustetto et al ( 2003 ) . Group data show that EF1\u03b1 mRNA is evenly distributed between SN neurites contacting L7 target and L11 non-target MNs both in control cultures ( C ) , and in cultures undergoing 5HT-induced LTF ( D ) . A bifurcated SN was cultured with two LFS motor neurons ( E and F ) for 3 days . On day 3 , local perfusion of five pulses of 5HT was performed to induce branch-specific LTF ( F ) , as described in Martin et al ( 1997 ) ; in control cultures , synapses were mock stimulated with five pulses of ASW ( E ) . Four hours later , cultures were processed for Fluorescent In Situ Hybridization ( FISH ) for EF1\u03b1 mRNA . Areas in soma and proximal SN neurites outlined with lettered white squares in low magnification DIC image on the left were imaged at high magnification to visualize EF1\u03b1 mRNA FISH signal . The increase in EF1\u03b1 mRNA FISH signal in ( F ) as compared to ( E ) indicates that EF1\u03b1 mRNA was induced by local stimulation with 5x5HT . This increase is quantified in SN soma and in proximal neurites in ( G ) and ( H ) . As shown in ( H ) , basally expressed and local stimulation-induced EF1\u03b1 mRNA was evenly distributed between 5HT-stimulated ( S ) - and unstimulated ( US ) -SN branches . ***p < 0 . 001 , Student's unpaired t-test .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 04158 . 008 We then asked whether local stimulation might regulate the transport of EF1\u03b1 from the soma towards stimulated synapses . Towards this end , we cultured a bifurcated SN with two target LFS MNs and used local perfusion to deliver five applications of 5HT to the connections made onto one of the MNs , which we have previously shown produces branch-specific LTF ( Martin et al . , 1997 ) . In control experiments , we locally perfused five applications of artificial seawater ( ASW ) , the vehicle . As shown in Figure 3 , FISH for EF1\u03b1 revealed that local stimulation with 5x5HT-induced expression of EF1\u03b1 , as evidenced in increase in EF1\u03b1 signal in the soma ( Figure 3G ) . Strikingly , the stimulated transcript was delivered equally well to both branches ( Figure 3F , H ) . These studies reveal that even following local stimulation , transcriptionally induced mRNAs are delivered throughout the neuronal arbor , to stimulated- and unstimulated-branches . We next studied the localization of the RNA binding protein Staufen in SNs contacting target and non-target MNs by expressing Aplysia Staufen ( ApStaufen ) tagged with the fluorescent protein dendra2 in bifurcated sensory neurons . We focused on Staufen because of its previously described role in transporting transcripts into dendrites of mammalian cells ( Kiebler et al . , 1999; Tang et al . , 2001 ) . As shown in Figure 4 , we found that ApStaufen-dendra2 was transported equally well to branches contacting target and non-target MNs . 10 . 7554/eLife . 04158 . 009Figure 4 . The RNA binding protein Aplysia Staufen targets equally well to SN neurites contacting L7 target and L11 non-target MNs . ( A ) C-terminally tagged dendra2-tagged Aplysia Staufen ( ApStaufen ) was microinjected together with Alexafluor 647 ( cyan ) into a cultured bifurcated SN contacting an L7 target MN and an L11 non-target MN at 1DIV .

The RNA binding protein Aplysia Staufen targets equally well to stimulated- and unstimulated-SN processes after local perfusion . ( A ) and ( B ) bifurcated sensory neurons ( SNs ) were cultured with two target LFS motor neurons ( MNs ) . C-terminally tagged dendra2-tagged Aplysia Staufen ( ApStaufen ) was expressed in the SN , which was also labeled by microinjection with Alexa647 ( cyan ) . Branch-specific long-term facilitation ( LTF ) was induced by local perfusion of 5X5HT ( B ) ; control cultures were locally perfused with 5 pulses of artificial seawater ( ASW ) ( A ) . Images were acquired before and 24 hr after local perfusion .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 04158 . 010 We also examined the distribution of ApStaufen-dendra2 in SN paired with two target MNs following local stimulation with 5X5HT to induce branch-specific LTF . As shown in Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1 , equal numbers of ApStaufen-dendra2 puncta were present in both SN branches in prior to stimulation and following local perfusion with vehicle ( ASW ) . While local stimulation with 5X5HT increased the number of ApStaufen-dendra2 puncta in the SN processes ( suggesting that local stimulation promotes the transport of RNAs out of the soma into the process ) , the increase was equivalent in stimulated- and unstimulated-SN branches . Together , our experiments using FISH to analyze rRNAs and sensorin and EF1\u03b1 mRNAs , and overexpression to analyze S6 ribosomal protein and Staufen , argue that ribosomes , mRNAs , and RNA binding proteins are transported throughout the neuron , without any preferential targeting from the soma to branches receiving synaptic signals . We have previously reported that local translation is spatially restricted to stimulated synapses during synapse-specific long-term facilitation ( LTF ) of SN-MN synapses ( Wang et al 2009 ) ; here , we asked whether local translation is also spatially restricted during synapse formation . To do this , we performed immunocytochemistry with anti-sensorin antibodies in sensory-motor cocultures ( 3DIV , Figure 5 ) . Again , we chose to focus on sensorin because it is only expressed in the SN and thus the signal derives exclusively from the SN . As shown in Figure 5B , C , sensorin protein was present at much higher concentrations in SN branches contacting target MNs than in branches contacting non-target MNs . These data are consistent with sensorin expression being spatially regulated at the level of translational regulation rather than mRNA targeting . 10 . 7554/eLife . 04158 . 011Figure 5 . Local translation is greater in SN neurites contacting L7 target MNs than in neurites contacting L11 non-target MNs . ( A ) A bifurcated SN was cultured with an L7 target MN and an L11 non-target MN for 3 days . Alexa647 was microinjected into the SN and served as a volume filling control for analysis of immunocytochemistry ( ICC ) . To monitor local translation , we performed ICC for phosphorylated eIF4E ( phospho-eIF4E ) , phosphorylated 4EBP , and sensorin protein . Representative high magnification images of areas denoted by white squares in ( A ) are shown in ( B ) , with merged DIC/Alexa fluor in the left panel , phospho-eIF4E ICC in the middle panel , and sensorin ICC in the right panel . Group data in ( C ) reveal that phospho-eIF4E , phospho-4EBP , and sensorin protein concentrations are significantly greater in neurites contacting L7 target MNs than in neurites contacting L11 non-target MNs . As shown in Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1 , total eIF4E and total 4EBP protein were distributed equally well in neurites contacting L7 target and L11 non-target MNs . To directly image local translation , we expressed a translational reporter consisting of sensorin mRNA fused to the photoconvertible fluorescent protein dendra2 ( as described in Wang et al . ( 2009 ) ) , removed the SN soma ( dotted circle in middle panel of D ) , and 12\u201318 hr later photoconverted the dendra2 signal from green to red ( right panel of D ) . Shown in ( E , neurite contacting L11 ) and ( F , neurite contacting L7 ) are high magnification images of regions marked by white squares in ( D ) , including images before photoconversion ( pre ) , right after PC ( post ) , 24 hr later ( 24 hr post ) . The top panels show the green channel and the bottom show the red channel ( which was used as volume control for quantification of the green signal ) . Increased green signal represents newly translated reporter .

To test that the antibodies specifically recognized the Aplysia homologs , we performed immunoblots of Aplysia CNS lysates and of HEK cell lysate with the eIF4E , phospho-eIF4E ( P-eIF4E ) , 4EBP , and phospho-4EBP ( P-4EBP ) antibodies ( J ) . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 04158 . 012 We previously reported live imaging experiments using a translational reporter consisting of the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 UTRs of sensorin fused to the photoconvertible fluorescent protein dendra2 to demonstrate synapse-specific translation during synapse-specific LTF of SN-MN synapses ( Wang et al . , 2009 ) . We now conducted live imaging experiments with this reporter to directly measure local translation ( as opposed to somatic translation followed by protein transport into the neurite during synapse formation ) ( Figure 5D , F ) . To do this , we expressed the reporter in bifurcated SNs contacting L7 and L11 MNs and removed the SN cell body so that we could specifically monitor translation in neuronal processes . We photoconverted dendra2 in the branches from green to red and used live imaging to detect the appearance of newly translated , green dendra2 signal , which we have previously demonstrated represents new translation ( Wang et al . , 2009 ) . As shown in Figure 5E , G , we detected a significantly greater increase in green signal in SN processes contacting the L7 target MN than in the SN processes contacting the L11 non-target MN . Together , these experiments indicate that although sensorin mRNA is delivered throughout the SN , it is preferentially translated at sites of synaptic contact . To determine whether this effect was specific to sensorin mRNA , or whether it applied more generally to global translation , we analyzed the localization of the translation eukaryotic initiation factor4E ( eIF4E ) and the 4E binding protein ( 4EBP ) in bifurcated sensory neurons contacting L7 and L11 motor neurons ( for demonstration of antibody specificity , see Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1J ) . As shown in Figure 5B , C and Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A , I , both eIF4E and 4EBP proteins distributed equally in SN branches contacting target and non-target MNs . However , when we used phospho-specific antibodies that recognize the activated forms of eIF4E ( peIF4E ) and 4EBP ( p4EBP ) , we detected significantly higher concentrations in SN branches making synaptic contact with L7 MNs . These findings indicate that translational machinery is distributed throughout the neuron but is preferentially activated at sites receiving a synaptogenic signal . Since phosphorylation of eIF4E and 4EBP activates global translation , our results indicate that translational regulation , rather than mRNA targeting , controls the locally regulated synaptic proteome . As an additional way of measuring translation , we used the recently developed ribopuromycylation method in which immunofluorescence is used to measure puromycin immobilized on ribosomes by the elongation inhibitor emetine . This metabolic labeling method allows detection of newly translated proteins . As shown in Figure 6 , these experiments revealed significantly more protein synthesis in SN varicosities contacting the synaptic L7 target MN than in SN contacts with the non-target L11 MN . These results provide further evidence that synapse formation does not alter RNA targeting within the neuron but rather spatially regulates translation . 10 . 7554/eLife . 04158 . 013Figure 6 . Global translation is also enriched in SN branches contacting L7 MN . A bifurcated SN was cultured with an L7 target MN and an L11 non-target MN ( A ) for 3 days . Alexa488 ( green ) was microinjected into the SN as a volume control for imaging ( A ) . Cultured neurons were processed for ICC for puromycin . 100 \u03bcM puromycin was applied to cultured neurons for 10 min in the presence of 200 \u03bcM emetine .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 04158 . 013 Our previous study using translational reporters to visualize local translation of sensorin mRNA during LTF of Aplysia SN-MN synapses ( Wang et al . , 2009 ) revealed that serotonin-regulated translation specifically at stimulated synapses and that this regulation required a calcium-dependent trans-synaptic signal from the MN to the SN ( Wang et al . , 2009 ) . Our current finding that sensorin protein was enriched at synaptic sites as compared to non-synaptic sites ( Figure 5B , C ) is also consistent with a role for a synaptically localized translational regulation mechanism . These findings suggested that a synaptically generated signal functioned to regulate translation . We considered the possibility that the guidance factor netrin-1 might serve as such a signal . Netrin-1 is a chemotropic factor known to induce synaptogenesis in Caenorhabditis elegans ( Col\u00f3n-Ramos et al . , 2007 ) and to stimulate translation in growth cones during axon guidance ( Campbell and Holt , 2001 ) . Flanagan and colleagues have reported that components of the translational machinery , including ribosomal subunits and translation factors , are tethered at the plasma membrane in neuronal dendrites by binding to the cytoplasmic tail of the netrin receptor Deleted in Colorectal Cancer ( DCC ) , ( Tcherkezian et al . , 2010 ) . Netrin-1 binding was shown to trigger the release of bound translational components and to thereby promote localized , netrin-1- dependent protein synthesis . Together , these findings suggested that release of netrin-1 from either SN or MN during synapse formation and during synaptic plasticity triggers translation at sites of synaptic but not non-synaptic contacts . We tested the possibility that netrin-1 regulates the synthesis of localized transcripts by incubating Aplysia sensory-motor neuronal cultures with recombinant Fc-netrin-1 . As shown in Figure 7A , C , bath application of netrin-1 ( 250 ng/ml ) for 24 hr increased sensorin immunoreactivity in SN branches contacting the L11 non-target MN , such that there was no longer any branch-specificity of sensorin protein concentration . 10 . 7554/eLife . 04158 . 014Figure 7 . Netrin-1 increases protein synthesis in SNs and strength of SN-target MN synapses . ( A ) A bifurcated sensory neuron was cultured with an L7 target MN and an L11 non-target MN for 3 days . Alexa647 was microinjected into SNs and served as a volume filling control for the analysis of immunocytochemistry ( ICC ) . Cultures were incubated with 250 ng/ml recombinant Fc human netrin-1 for 24 hr . Representative high magnification images of areas marked by white squares in ( A ) are shown in ( B ) , with merged DIC/Alexa488 in the left panels , and sensorin ICC in the right panels . Group data ( C ) reveal that the concentration of sensorin in netrin-1-treated SNs is the same in neurites contacting L7 target MNs and L11 non-target MNs . We compared sensorin ( D ) and phospho-eIF4E immunoreactivity ( not shown ) in SN-LFS target MN cultures in the presence and absence of 250 ng/ml Fc-netrin-1 ( 24 hr ) . Representative high magnification images of areas denoted by white squares in left panels of ( D ) stained with anti-sensorin antibodies are shown in right panels of ( D ) . Group data ( E ) reveal that netrin-1 triggers an increase in sensorin and phospho-eIF4E immunoreactivity that is equivalent to the increase observed 24 hr after 5 spaced applications of 5HT ( which produce long-term facilitation ) and that is blocked by the protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin ( 10 mM ) . The effect of netrin-1 on sensorin immunoreactivity in isolated SN processes and on eIF4E and phospho-eIF4e immunoreactivity is shown in Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1 . Netrin-1 also increased synaptic strength: representative traces of EPSPs evoked in LFS MNs after stimulation of SN , at time 0 and 24 hr after incubation with vehicle ( artificial seawater , ASW ) or netrin-1 are shown in ( F ) ; histogram of group data is shown in ( G ) .

To differentiate between stimulated local translation and stimulated somatic translation followed by transport into the branches , we cultured bifurcated SN-MN , removed the SN cell body , incubated with netrin-1 , and processed the cultures 24 hr later for sensorin immunoreactivity ( Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1A , C ) . These experiments revealed that netrin-1 increased sensorin concentration equally well in branches contacting both L7 and L11 MNs , consistent with local stimulation of translation . Netrin-1 also increased peIF4E immunoreactivity in SN-LFS cultures in which the SN soma had been removed ( Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1C ) . The netrin-1-induced increase in sensorin immunoreactivity in intact SN-LFS cocultures was similar to that observed with five spaced applications of serotonin ( 5HT ) , which produces LTF of SN-MN synapses and which has been shown to promote sensorin translation ( Figure 7E ) ( Hu et al . , 2006; Wang et al . , 2009 ) . Moreover , netrin-1-induced translation in intact or soma-lacking SNs was blocked by pre-incubation with the protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin ( 10 \u03bcM for 24 hr ) , indicating that the increased immunoreactivity did indeed result from increased translation ( Figure 7E and Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1C ) . We considered the possibility that netrin-1 might transform non-synaptic sites to synapses and that the increase in translation occurred as a result of the conversion of non-synaptic to synaptic sites . However , incubation of SN-L11 cocultures or L7-SN-L11 cocultures with netrin-1 did not result in the formation of synapse as shown by the absence of an excitatory post-synaptic potential ( EPSP ) in the L11 MN after SN stimulation ( data not shown ) . We did find , however , that incubation with netrin-1 significantly increased EPSP amplitude between SN and LFS target MNs ( Figure 7F , G ) . The increase in EPSP amplitude was similar to that seen during LTF induced by five spaced applications of 5HT ( data not shown ) . LTF induced by five applications of 5HT has also been shown to involve significant increases in the number of SN varicosities ( sites of synaptic connections ) in SN-MN cultures ( Glanzman , et al . , 1990 ) . We thus measured the effect of netrin-1 on varicosity numbers , and , as shown in Figure 7H , found that it significantly increased the number of SN synaptic varicosities in SN-LFS MN cultures . Together , these findings suggest that the local translation induced by netrin-1 increases synaptic strength and synapse number . To explore the mechanisms by which netrin-1 regulates translation , we first asked whether it did so by binding to DCC . To test this , we incubated cultured neurons with recombinant netrin-1 in the presence of monoclonal anti-DCC antibodies that have previously been shown to block netrin-1 binding to the DCC receptor ( Bennett et al . , 1997; Braisted et al . , 2000; Manitt et al . , 2009 ) . We first showed that a 24 hr incubation of isolated SNs with netrin-1 triggered a significant increase in sensorin immunoreactivity , but that incubation of isolated SNs with anti-DCC ( in the absence of netrin-1 ) did not change sensorin immunoreactivity ( Figure 8A , B ) . While anti-DCC antibodies had no effect on the basal concentration of sensorin in isolated SNs , they significantly decreased basal sensorin immunoreactivity in SN-MN cocultures ( Figure 8C , D ) . Taken together , these findings are consistent with netrin-1 being endogenously released from the post-synaptic MN and binding to DCC on the SN to promote pre-synaptic translation of sensorin . 10 . 7554/eLife . 04158 . 016Figure 8 . Netrin-1 binds DCC to promote SN translation and to increase strength of SN-MN synapses . ( A ) and ( B ) : immunocytochemistry ( ICC ) of isolated SNs ( 3DIV ) reveals an increase in sensorin immunoreactivity with recombinant Fc human netrin-1 incubation ( 250 ng/ml for 24 hr ) , but no change from baseline following 24 hr of incubation with function-blocking anti-DCC antibodies ( 250 ng/ml ) . Representative images are shown in ( A ) ; group data in ( B ) . To test the effect of function-blocking anti-DCC antibodies on sensorin and phospho-eIF4E ( peIF4E ) immunoreactivity and synapse formation in SN-LFS target MN cocultures , we cultured isolated SNs for a day , added anti-DCC ( 250 ng/ml ) , and 6 hr later paired the SN with a target LFS MN . EPSP amplitude was recorded the next day , and cultures were fixed for ICC . Representative cultures are shown in ( C ) . High magnification images of areas denoted by white squares in left DIC images are shown in the middle ( sensorin ICC ) and the right ( merged DIC and sensorin , red ) panels . Group data ( D ) show that anti-DCC significantly decreases sensorin and peIF4E immunoreactivity , consistent with netrin being released from the MN to drive translation in the SN . SN-LFS MN pairs incubated with anti-DCC antibodies also showed significantly smaller EPSP amplitudes than do control cultures ( E ) . To query the function of netrin-1/DCC signaling in mature , established SN-LFS MN synapses , we cultured SN-LFS MNs for 2 days , added anti-DCC antibodies ( 250 ng/ml ) for 24 hr , and then measured EPSP amplitude and fixed the cultures for ICC . Representative cultures are shown in ( F ) . High magnification images of areas denoted by white squares in left-most panels ( F ) are shown in middle ( sensorin immunoreactivity ) and right ( merged DIC and sensorin , red ) panels . Group data show that anti-DCC antibodies significantly decreased sensorin and peIF4E immunoreactivity ( G ) and EPSP amplitude between SN-LFS MNs ( H ) . Control cultures were incubated with anti-mouse IgG antibodies ( 250 ng/ml ) , which did not affect EPSP amplitude ( H ) .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 04158 . 016 We next explored the function of netrin-1/DCC signaling during synapse formation . Towards this end , we cultured a SN for 24 hr , then added a MN in the presence or absence of vehicle ( ASW ) , control IgG ( non-immune mouse IgG ) , or function-blocking anti-DCC antibodies , and measured EPSP amplitude 24 hr later . As shown in Figure 8H , EPSP amplitude was significantly lower in cultures incubated with anti-DCC antibodies than in control cultures . This was accompanied by a decrease in sensorin immunoreactivity in the cultures incubated with anti-DCC antibodies ( Figure 8C , D ) . To determine whether netrin-1/DCC also regulated synapse maintenance and/or stability , we cultured SN-MN neurons for 2 days , added anti-DCC antibodies , and then measured EPSP amplitude 24 hr later . As shown in Figure 8E , this also triggered a significant decrease in EPSP amplitude ( Figure 8H ) and sensorin immunoreactivity ( Figure 8D ) , consistent with netrin-1/DCC signaling contributing to synapse stability/maintenance . To further examine netrin-1 and DCC expression in Aplysia SN-MN cocultures , we cloned the Aplysia homologs ( submitted to GenBank ) . Aplysia Netrin-1 ( ApNetrin-1 , accession #KM218335 ) was 47% identical and 60% conserved with human Netrin-1 , and Aplysia DCC ( ApDCC , accession # KM218336 ) was 31% identical and 47% conserved with human DCC . To assay the effect of ApNetrin-1 on synaptic strength , we overexpressed c-terminally tagged dendra2-ApNetrin-1 in MNs ( with overexpression of dendra2 as a negative control ) and determined the effect on sensorin immunoreactivity ( as a proxy for translation ) and SN-MN strength . As shown in Figure 9 , overexpression of dendra2-tagged ApNetrin-1 in MNs generated a punctate staining pattern throughout the neuronal process . Overexpression of ApNetrin-1 in the MN significantly increased the concentration of sensorin protein in the SN as measured by immunocytochemistry ( Figure 9B , C ) , consistent with a netrin-1-dependent stimulation of translation . Measurement of EPSP amplitude before and 24 hr after overexpression of dendra2-ApNetrin-1 , or overexpression of dendra2 as a negative control , revealed that ApNetrin-1 significantly increased synaptic strength between SN and MN ( Figure 9E ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 04158 . 017Figure 9 . Overexpression of Aplysia netrin-1 increases translation and synaptic strength in SN-MN synapses . SN-LFS MNs were cultured for 3 days ( A\u2013C ) . The SN was microinjected with Alexa647 ( blue ) and the MN with a vector expressing Aplysia netrin-1 ( ApNetrin-1 ) c-terminally tagged with dendra2 ( green , A ) . The left panel of A shows a low magnification image , and the right shows high magnification of area outlined with a white square , as a merged DIC/ApNetrin ( green ) and Alexa647 ( SN , blue ) image . ApNetrin-dendra is present in a punctate pattern throughout the MN process ( A ) . In ( B ) , on DIV3 , vectors expressing dendra2 ( upper panel ) or Aplysia netrin-1 c-terminally tagged with dendra2 ( lower panel ) were microinjected into the LFS MN . Basal EPSPs were measured before and 24 hr after microinjection , and cultures were then processed for immunocytochemistry with anti-sensorin antibodies . Representative high magnification images of areas denoted by white squares in ( B ) are shown in ( C ) with sensorin protein in the left panel and merged image for DIC/sensorin ( red ) in the right panel , in cultures in which the MN expresses dendra2 ( top ) or ApNetrin-dendra2 ( bottom ) . Group data ( D ) show that sensorin immunoreactivity was increased in SNs paired with MNs overexpressing ApNetrin-1 . Overexpression of ApNetrin in the MN also increases the EPSP amplitude , while overexpression of dendra2 in the MN has no effect on EPSP amplitude between SN and MN at 24 hr ( E ) .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 04158 . 017 Since our previous study had indicated that local translation required a calcium-dependent retrograde signal from the MN ( Wang et al . , 2009 ) , we next asked whether ApNetrin-1 release from the MN was a calcium-dependent process . To do this , we expressed ApNetrin-1 tagged with dendra2 in the MN , and labeled the MN with Alexa fluor 647 and the SN with ApDCC tagged with mCherry . As shown in Figure 10 , despite being expressed in the MN , the majority of the ApNetrin-1-dendra2 signal was found outside of the MN , decorating the processes of the SN , suggesting that ApNetrin-1 was released from the MN and bound to the SN . We note that overexpression of ApDCC-mCherry in the SN increased the ApNetrin-1 signal that decorated the SN ( as compared to the signal that was observed in SNs labeled with red Alexa647 , as in Figure 9 ) , and thus allowed us to clearly detect binding of green ApNetrin-1 expressed in the MN to the red SN . To determine whether ApNetrin-1 bound to DCC on the SN , we performed these experiments in cultures containing anti-DCC antibodies in the medium ( or non-immune IgG as a negative control ) . As shown in Figure 10\u2014figure supplement 1 , incubation with anti-DCC antibodies dramatically decreased the binding of ApNetrin-1 to the SN , as assayed using Pearson's Correlation to monitor the colocalization of green ApNetrin-1-dendra2 and red DCC-mCherry . 10 . 7554/eLife . 04158 . 018Figure 10 . ApNetrin-1 undergoes calcium-dependent release from MN and binds SN . SN-LFS MNs were cultured for 2 days , and the SN was microinjected with a vector expressing ApDCC c-terminally tagged with mCherry ( red ) and the MN with Alexa647 ( blue ) and with a vector expressing Aplysia netrin-1 ( ApNetrin-1 ) c-terminally tagged with dendra2 ( green ) . In the top panel of ( A ) , the MN was microinjected with vehicle; in the bottom panel of ( A ) , the MN was microinjected with BAPTA ( 50 mM ) to chelate calcium . Cultures were imaged before and 24 hr after BAPTA or buffer injection later .

Incubation with anti-DCC antibodies inhibits binding of MN-expressed ApNetrin-1 to SNs .

To test the effect of anti-DCC antibodies on the binding of ApNetrin-1 to the SN , cultures were incubated with anti-DCC antibodies ( 250 ng/ml ) for 24 hr .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 04158 . 019 To test whether release from the MN required calcium , we microinjected 50 mM BAPTA into the MN and 3 hr later imaged green ApNetrin-1-dendra2 signal localization . As shown in Figure 10B , D , when calcium was chelated in the MN , green ApNetrin-1-dendra2 signal was sequestered in the MN and did not colocalize with the SN . In contrast , in the absence of BAPTA , the green ApNetrin-1-dendra2 signal decorated the processes of the SN . Together , these findings are consistent with calcium-dependent release of ApNetrin-1 from the MN and binding to the SN . \n Studies of mRNA localization in non-neuronal asymmetric cells have revealed that a large number of transcripts localize to specific subcellular compartments . For example , high throughput FISH analyses of over 3000 transcripts in Drosophila embryos indicated that over 70% of mRNAs were expressed in an array of highly specific subcellular patterns ( L\u00e9cuyer et al . , 2007 ) . These findings suggest that targeted localization of mRNA spatially regulates gene expression to essentially define the fate of discrete subcellular compartments . We have previously identified hundreds of mRNAs in the neurites of Aplysia SNs ( Moccia et al . , 2003 ) , and studies of localized mRNAs in mammalian hippocampal neurons have indicated that hundreds ( Eberwine et al . , 2002; Poon et al . , 2006 ) to thousands of transcripts ( Cajigas et al . , 2012 ) localize to dendrites . While some studies have indicated that a handful of these mRNAs localize to specific subcellular loci within the neuronal process , including sensorin mRNA , which localizes to synapses in Aplysia SNs ( Lyles et al . , 2006 ) , and arc mRNA , which localizes to stimulated synapses in mammalian dentate granule neurons ( Steward et al . , 1998 ) , whether or not mRNAs undergo directed targeting from the soma to specific synapses , and whether or not RNA localization defines the fate of specific neuronal compartments , remains an open question . The Aplysia SN-MN culture system provides an ideal preparation for monitoring mRNA localization and local translation during synapse formation and synaptic plasticity , since a single neuron can be manipulated to form synapses or to undergo transcription- and translation-dependent synaptic strengthening in a branch-specific manner . Using this preparation , we find that the local proteome was regulated at the level of translation rather than by stimulus-induced mRNA targeting from the nucleus . Thus , transcripts , ribosomes , and translational machinery were delivered throughout the neuron , but translation was selectively activated in response to local stimuli such as synapse formation . We note that our studies do not rule out a role for more localized subcellular trafficking of mRNAs within neuronal processes , and/or selective stabilization within processes ( as described in Farris et al . ( 2014 ) ) , but they do indicate that synapse formation and synaptic stimulation do not regulate the trafficking from cell soma to process or synapse . Thus , transcripts that are induced by stimuli are delivered throughout the neuron , with their local distribution and translation being regulated by localized cues . We focused on a role for netrin-1 as the retrograde signal driving translation in the sensory neuron because it has been shown to promote translation in axonal growth cones ( Campbell and Holt , 2001 ) , to promote synaptogenesis in mammalian cortical neurons ( Goldman et al . , 2013 ) , and because Flanagan et al . have reported that the netrin receptor DCC serves as a transmembrane translation regulation complex in dendrites and axons ( Tcherkezian et al . , 2010 ) . The finding that anti-DCC antibodies decrease sensorin immunoreactivity in SNs paired with MNs , but not in isolated SNs , is consistent with netrin-1 being released from the MN and binding to DCC on the adjacent pre-synaptic SN to promote the translation of sensorin at synapses . Netrin-1 binding to DCC may promote translation by releasing translational machinery from binding DCC cytoplasmic domains within the pre-synaptic terminal , as proposed by Flanagan et al . ( 2010 ) . Alternatively , netrin-1-induced translation may be downstream of PI3 kinase and/or MAPK pathways , both of which are activated by netrin-1 binding to DCC ( Li et al . , 2004; Round and Stein , 2007 ) . We previously reported that serotonin-induced translation of sensorin in SNs required a calcium-dependent retrograde signal from the MN ( Wang et al . , 2009 ) . In the present study , we show that ApNetrin expressed in MN is released and binds to the SN in a calcium-dependent manner . What the source of calcium is remains an open question . One possibility is that it results from spontaneous release of glutamate from the pre-synaptic SN during synapse formation and/or during synaptic plasticity ( Eliot et al . , ( 1994 ) ; Jin et al . , ( 2012 ) ; Villareal et al . , ( 2007 ) ) , although see also Sutton et al . ( 2006 ) , which indicates that spontaneous release serves to suppress local translation in hippocampal neurons . While we used recombinant human netrin-1 and function-blocking antibodies against human DCC , we are confident that these reagents reflect the endogenous functions of netrin-1 and DCC in Aplysia . We cloned Aplysia netrin-1 and found that it is 47% identical and 60% similar to human netrin-1 ( by comparison , C . elegans netrin-1 is 44% identical and 59% similar to human netrin-1 ) . We also cloned Aplysia DCC and found that it is 31% identical and 47% similar to human DCC ( by comparison , C . elegans DCC is 18% identical and 31% similar to human DCC ) . Moreover , the function-blocking antibody recognizes the extracellular domain , which is the most highly conserved region of the protein ( extracellular domain of Aplysia DCC is 39% identical and 55% similar to human DCC ) . Finally , we show that overexpression of ApNetrin in MNs significantly increases synaptic strength and sensorin immunoreactivity ( Figure 9 ) . We suspect that netrin-1/DCC signaling is one of multiple local cues and signaling pathways that regulate translation in neurons and that translation is not regulated in a digital on/off manner , but rather in a graded manner . This explains , for example , why there is some sensorin translation in SN neurites contacting non-target L11 ( Figure 5 ) , and why sensorin protein is expressed in isolated sensory neurons that have been incubated with anti-DCC antibodies ( Figure 8A ) . Our previously published report that synapse formation alters the localization of sensorin mRNA such that it concentrates at synapses ( Lyles et al . , 2006; Meer et al . , 2012 ) , and that serotonin-regulated translation of a sensorin-based translational reporter was restricted to sites of synaptic contact , suggested that the activity-dependent synaptic localization of mRNA played a critical role in the regulation of its translation . Our current finding that netrin-1 increases translation at synaptic and non-synaptic sites indicates that the precise subcellular localization of the mRNA is secondary to the localization of the netrin-1 signal . Thus , sensorin mRNA does not have to be in the synaptic milieu per se to be translated but rather has to localize to a site in which netrin-1/DCC signaling can occur . We also note that we previously found that there was an increase in the concentration of sensorin mRNA in SN branches contacting target as compared to non-target MNs in more mature ( 5 DIV ) cocultures ( Lyles et al . , 2006 ) . This suggests that while there is not directed targeting of sensorin mRNA from soma to process during synapse formation , there may be preferential stabilization , over time , of sensorin mRNA at sites of synaptic contact . This finding is consistent with recent studies indicating that regulated RNA degradation functions to localize mRNAs and to limit translation within axons ( Colak et al . , 2013 ) . Our study also sheds light on the relative contributions of local translation and somatic translation to the local proteome . Thus , we can compare the amount of netrin-1-induced translation of the sensorin reporter in SN-LFS cocultures with and without the soma ( Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1D ) . Although one cannot directly compare the total concentration of sensorin in intact SN and isolated SN neurites , our data indicate that netrin-1 is able to induce an equivalent increase in SN neurites in the presence or absence of a SN soma . This suggests that local translation contributes substantially to stimulus-induced changes in the local proteome . The fact that netrin-1 was able to stimulate global translation at non-synaptic sites as detected by phospho-eIF4E immunocytochemistry ( Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1C ) suggests that a large number of transcripts , and not just the two mRNAs we detected by FISH , localize throughout the neuronal arbor . Moreover , we found that every type of RNA that we imaged was delivered from the soma throughout the neuronal arbor , whether during synapse formation or following local stimulation . In contrast , we found that every measure of translation that we employed demonstrated localized translation at synapses and/or stimulated synapses . While our results are consistent with the idea that mRNAs are delivered throughout the neuronal arbor , validation of this idea as a general mechanism will require analysis of a larger pool of specific transcripts . Taken together , our findings show that a signaling pathway involved in axon guidance also regulates synapse formation by spatially restricting neuronal gene expression . Our findings further underscore an uncoupling of transcriptional and translational regulation in neurons , with stimuli triggering transcription of a population of mRNAs that are delivered throughout the neuron , but with local cues independently regulating their translation . Decentralizing the control of gene expression to individual subcellular compartments in this manner enriches the adaptability and plasticity of the nervous system by enabling each compartment to change its proteome in response to local cues . This mechanism allows all the branches of a neuron to be in a state of readiness to respond to local stimuli by changing their local proteome and hence their synaptic structure and function . \n Cultures were prepared from adult 80\u2013100 gram Aplysia ( Alacrity , Redondo Beach , CA ) for SN-LFS MN cultures or from the abdominal ganglion of juvenile Aplysia ( 1\u20134 g , National Aplysia Resource , University of Miami , FL ) for L7 and L11 MNs . Animals were anesthetized by injecting 0 . 35 M MgCl2 into the body , ganglia were dissected and incubated in protease ( 10 unit/ml protease XIV , Sigma #P5147 ) in L15 culture media for 1 hr 50 min to digest the connective tissue sheath . Bifurcated SNs from the pedal\u2013pleural ganglia were paired with L7 and L11 MNs from the abdominal ganglion of juvenile Aplysia or with two LFS MNs from adult animals . Culture methods are described in detail in Zhao et al . ( 2009 ) . To induce LTF of SN-MN synapses , we applied five spaced applications of 5HT ( 10 \u03bcM ) using either bath or local perfusion . Bath application of 5x5HT consisted of five 5 min applications of 5HT ( 10 \u03bcM ) in L15 media with four intervening 20 min washes in L15 , for a total stimulation time of 1 hr 45 min . Local perfusion of 5x5HT consisted of local delivery of 5HT ( 100 \u03bcM ) to SN-MN synapses with a perfusion pipette; five applications were given at 10 min intervals , with each application consisting of five 5 s pulses given at 10 s intervals . ASW ( Artificial Sea Water ) was used as a control for all experiments . Cultures were fixed immediately after the last stimulation or at 24 hr after stimulation and processed for immunocytochemistry or FISH . Confocal images were taken on a Zeiss LSM 700 scanning laser microscope . For FISH and ICC experiments , we used a Picospritzer ( World Precision Instrument , Sarasota , FL ) to microinject 5 mM Alexa647 ( bifurcated SN ) or Alexa546 ( L7 MN ) as volume controls and to clearly differentiate SN from MN neurites at least 3 hr before confocal imaging . Image analysis was done by an observer blind to experimental design . To investigate the distribution of RNA granules during synapse formation , 200 ng/\u03bcl ApStaufen-dendra2 ( in pNEX3 ) together with Alexa647 was microinjected into SNs on DIV 1 and imaged on DIV3 . For the RNA granules targeting after local perfusion , images were acquired before and 24 hr after local perfusion . To measure new translation , we microinjected 200 ng/\u03bcl sensorin-dendra2 reporter ( in pNEX3 , described in Wang et al . ( 2009 ) ) into SNs on DIV 1 . On day 2 , we removed the SN cell body and 18 hr later , we photoconverted dendra2 from green to red as a described in Wang et al . ( 2009 ) , with slight modifications , using an X-cite series120Q excitation light ( a 120-watt lamp ) , delivering two 5 s pulses of UV illumination with a 10 s interval . After imaging , we returned cultures to the 18\u00b0C incubator and imaged the green and red signals 24 hr later . To compare new translation in SN branches contacting target or non-target motor neuron , we measured total fluorescence ( area ( \u03bcm2 ) \u00d7 mean fluorescence intensity ) of both green and red fluorescence using Slidebook5 software . New translation was normalized as the total pixel intensity in the dendra2 green signal to the dendra2 red signal 24 hr after photoconversion . To test whether ApNet-1 depends on post-synaptic Ca2+ , 200 ng/\u03bcl dendra2-tagged ApNet-1 ( green ) was microinjected to the LFS MN and 200 ng/\u03bcl ApDCC-mCherry ( red ) was microinjected into the SN at DIV2 . 24 hrs later , 50 mM BAPTA in Buffer ( 1 . 5 M K-Acetate , 0 . 5 M KCl , 0 . 01 M HEPES , pH7 . 2 ) was microinjected into the post-synaptic LFS MN . Buffer alone was microinjected as a control . Images were taken pre- and 24 hr after BAPTA or buffer microinjection . To test the effect of anti-DCC antibodies on the binding of MN-expressed ApNetrin-1-dendra2 to ApDCC-mCherry-expressing SNs , cultures were incubated with anti-DCC antibodies ( 250 ng/ml ) for 24 hr . In control cultures , ASW or non-immune IgG ( 250 ng/ml ) was added for 24 hr . Images were taken 24 hr after incubation . To measure varicosity number in SN-MN cocultures , a VAMP ( synaptobrevin ) -mCherry pNEX3 construct was expressed in SNs paired with LFS MNs for 48 hr . The number of varicosities was measured before and 24 hr after incubation with 250 ng/ml netrin-1 . EPSP amplitude was measured as described in Zhao et al . ( 2003 ) . Briefly , LFS MNs were impaled with a sharp glass electrode ( 10\u201315 M\u03a9 ) filled with 2 M potassium acetate , and the membrane potential of MNs was held at \u221280 mV and of SNs at \u221250 mV . EPSP amplitudes were measured before and 24 hr after 250 ng/ml netrin-1 treatment in L15 media using Axoscope 8 . 2 and pCLAMP 8 ( Axon Instruments , Union City , CA ) following intracellular depolarization ( 1\u20133 nA for 5 ms ) of the SN . Artificial Sea Water ( ASW ) was used as a vehicle control . We slightly modified the ribopuromycylation method described in David et al . ( 2012 ) . Specifically , we cultured Aplysia SNs with L7 target MNs and L11 non-target MNs for 3DIV and then replaced the culture media with L15 media . Cultured neurons were incubated with 200 \u03bcM emetine in L15 media for 30 min before adding puromycin . After 30 min , 100 \u03bcM puromycin with 200 \u03bcM emetin in L15 media was added for 10 min . Cultured neurons were then washed with L15 and immediately fixed with 4% PFA/30% sucrose for 30 min . FISH was performed as described in Lyles et al . ( 2006 ) with slight modifications . Briefly , cultured neurons were fixed with 4% PFA/30% sucrose for 30 min at room temperature . For FISH , after fixation , we hybridized with 40 ng/ml 18S rRNA , 28S rRNA , EF1\u03b1 RNA , or sensorin RNA probed and imaged after FISH . For \u03b2-thymosin RNA FISH , we followed by the protocol as described in ViewRNA ISH processes ( Affymetrix , Santa Clara , CA ) . Image settings were adjusted so that sense 18S rRNA , sense 28S rRNA , sense EF1\u03b1 RNA , and sense sensorin mRNA probes did not produce any signal and no probes were used as negative control for \u03b2-thymosin RNA . To generate riboprobes , we performed in vitro transcription with T7/T3 polymerase , tagging riboprobes with digoxigenin or biotin and purifying with ProbeQuant G-50 microcolumn ( #28-9034-08; GE healthcare , Piscataway , NJ ) . Before we used riboprobes , we measured their concentration and tested their specificity by dot blotting with anti-digoxigenin-POD ( #11207733910; Roche , Indianapolis , IN ) or HRP-mouse anti-biotin ( #03-3720; Invitrogen , Grand Island , NY ) . All FISH experiments were performed with sense riboprobes as a control to measure background signals . FISH detection using the TSA amplification system was followed as a described in Lyles et al . ( 2006 ) . To investigate netrin-1 mediated translation , 250 ng/ml recombinant Fc human netrin-1 ( #ALX-522-455; Enzo life sciences , Farmingdale , NY ) in L15 media or functional blocking anti-DCC ( #OP45; Milipore , Billerica , MA ) was applied to cultures for 24 hr and then washed with L15 media . Cultures were immediately fixed with 4% PFA/30% sucrose for 30 min . After fixation , ICC was performed as described in Martin et al . ( 1997 ) . Primary antibodies included custom-made chicken anti-sensorin antibodies ( generated against peptide CATRSKNNVPRRFPRARYRVGYMF by Aves Labs , Inc . , Tigard , OR ) , rabbit anti-eIF4E ( #9742; Cell Signaling , Beverly , MA ) , rabbit anti-phospho eIF4E ( #9741; Cell Signaling ) , rabbit anti-4EBP ( #9452; Cell Signaling ) , rabbit anti-phospho 4EBP ( #2855; Cell Signaling ) , and mouse monoclonal anti-puromycin , clone 12D100 ( Millipore , #MABE343 ) . Degenerate primers were used to amplify segments of netrin-1 and DCC from RNA isolated from adult Aplysia CNS . The sequenced fragments were BLAST searched against the following database: http://aplysiagenetools . org/ . Identified hits were used to generate primers that were in turn used to amplify full-length Aplysia netrin-1 ( GenBank accession #KM218335 ) and DCC ( accession #KM218336 ) from RNA isolated from CNS . Full-length clones were verified by sequencing . All results are presented as mean \u00b1 SEM . Prism GraphPad was used to perform all statistical analysis .

{"lay_summary": "Embryos begin as a collection of similar cells , which progress in stages to form a huge variety of cell types in particular arrangements . These patterns of cells give rise to the different tissues and organs that make up the body . Although we often use \u2018model\u2019 organisms such as mice and frogs to study how embryos develop , our species has evolved unique ways to control organ development . Investigating these processes is difficult: we cannot experiment on human embryos , and our development is hard to recreate in test tubes . As a result , we do not fully understand how developing human cells specialize and organize . Libby et al . have now created a new system to study how different genes control cell organization . The system uses human pluripotent stem cells \u2013 cells that have the ability to specialize into any type of cell . Some of the stem cells are modified using a technique called inducible CRISPR interference , which makes it possible to reduce the activity of certain genes in these cells . Libby et al . used this technique to investigate how changes to the activity of two genes \u2013 called ROCK1 and CDH1 \u2013 affect how a mixed group of stem cells organized themselves . Cells that lacked ROCK1 formed bands near the edges of the group . Cells that lacked CDH1 segregated themselves from other cells , forming \u2018islands\u2019 inside the main group . The cells retained their ability to specialize into any type of cell after forming these patterns . However , specific groups of cells were more likely to become certain cell types . The method developed by Libby et al . can be used to study a range of complex tissue development and cell organization processes . Future work could create human tissue model systems for research into human disease or drug development .", "article": "Morphogenesis involves interactions of asymmetric cell populations to form complex multicellular patterns and structures comprised of distinct cell types . However , current methods to model morphogenic events lack control over cell-type co-emergence and offer little capability to selectively perturb specific cell subpopulations . Our in vitro system interrogates cell-cell interactions and multicellular organization within human induced pluripotent stem cell ( hiPSC ) colonies . We examined effects of induced mosaic knockdown of molecular regulators of cortical tension ( ROCK1 ) and cell-cell adhesion ( CDH1 ) with CRISPR interference . Mosaic knockdown of ROCK1 or CDH1 resulted in differential patterning within hiPSC colonies due to cellular self-organization , while retaining an epithelial pluripotent phenotype . Knockdown induction stimulates a transient wave of differential gene expression within the mixed populations that stabilized in coordination with observed self-organization . Mosaic patterning enables genetic interrogation of emergent multicellular properties , which can facilitate better understanding of the molecular pathways that regulate symmetry-breaking during morphogenesis . \n Early morphogenic tissue development requires the robust coordination of biochemical and biophysical signaling cues to dictate cell-cell communication , multicellular organization , and cell fate determination . ( Burdsal et al . , 1993; Leckband et al . , 2011; Montero and Heisenberg , 2004 ) . A hallmark of morphogenesis is the asymmetric co-emergence of distinct cell populations that self-organize to form developmental patterns , multicellular structures , and ultimately , functional tissues and organs ( Bronner , 2016; Lancaster and Knoblich , 2014; Sasai , 2013 ) . For example , during gastrulation , the blastocyst transitions from a relatively homogeneous population of pluripotent cells to a spatially organized , multicellular composition of distinct progenitor cells . Therefore , to study morphogenesis , it is essential to promote the coincident development of analogous heterogeneous populations in vitro . Human pluripotent stem cells ( hPSCs ) provide an unlimited source of cells that can mimic developmental differentiation processes and maintain the ability to self-organize into tissue-like structures , such as optic cups , gut organoids , or stratified cortical tissues ( Eiraku et al . , 2008; Eiraku et al . , 2011; Spence et al . , 2011 ) . However , due to the intrinsic variability of organoids ( Bredenoord et al . , 2017 ) and the lack of alternative human models that faithfully promote asymmetric emergence , many of the mechanisms that control and coordinate morphogenesis remain undefined . Therefore , new approaches to reliably control the emergence and organization of multiple cell types would greatly advance tissue modeling and organ developmental studies . Controlling cellular heterogeneity in vitro is often achieved by independent differentiation of hPSCs followed by re-combination of distinct cell types , which fails to mimic parallel cell-type emergence ( Matthys et al . , 2016 ) . Attempts to engineer in vitro systems that yield controlled emergence of spatial organization often rely on extrinsic physical restriction of cells to direct subsequent multicellular pattern formation ( Hsiao et al . , 2009; Warmflash et al . , 2014 ) . Physical constraints allow the observational study of cell-cell interactions within defined regions , but artificially restrict cell behaviors by limiting the degrees of freedom in which morphogenic phenomena can occur . Additionally , current tools to interrogate gene function , such as genetic knockouts or siRNA ( Boettcher and McManus , 2015 ) , cannot selectively perturb gene expression of subpopulations of cells in situ , which is required to generate controlled asymmetry analogous to embryonic morphogenesis . Several of these limitations can be addressed with inducible CRISPR interference ( CRISPRi ) systems in mammalian cells ( Larson et al . , 2013; Mandegar et al . , 2016 ) . CRISPRi silencing enables temporal regulation over knockdowns ( KD ) of specific genetic targets with limited off-target effects . Temporal KD constraints enable the development of precisely-controlled engineered biological systems that can induce well-defined genetic perturbation at explicit times and within defined populations of cells to mimic developmental symmetry-breaking events . Morphogenic asymmetries arise from reorganization of cells due to local changes in mechanical tissue stiffness and cell adhesions that facilitate physical organization of developing embryos ( Krieg et al . , 2008; Ma\u00eetre et al . , 2012 ) . Mechanical rearrangement is necessary for many aspects of morphogenesis , including cell polarity , collective movement , multicellular organization , and organ size regulation ( Arboleda-Estudillo et al . , 2010; Ma\u00eetre , 2017 ) . Differential adhesion ( Foty and Steinberg , 2004; Foty and Steinberg , 2005 ) and cortical tension ( Van Essen and Essen , 1997; Krieg et al . , 2008 ) are critical determinants of mechanically-driven cell sorting , in which both processes are known to contribute to tissue organization ( Lecuit and Lenne , 2007 ) . In cortical tension-dominated sorting , variable actin cytoskeleton-generated cortex tension stimulates sorting of individual cells , whereas differential adhesion sorting promotes segregation of cell populations due to intercellular homophilic adhesions . Rho-associated coiled-coil containing protein kinase ( ROCK1 ) and E-cadherin ( CDH1 ) are interesting orthogonal gene targets to interrogate hPSC population organization by altering the intrinsic mechanics of distinct cell populations . ROCK1 regulates actin-myosin dynamics ( Figure 1A ) , which contribute to a cell\u2019s cortical tension ( Salbreux et al . , 2012 ) . In addition , ROCK inhibition is often used in hPSC culture and has been implicated in pluripotency maintenance ( McBeath et al . , 2004; Ohgushi et al . , 2015 ) . Similarly , CDH1 , a classic type I cadherin adhesion molecule , is widely associated with pluripotency and early morphogenesis ( Heasman et al . , 1994; Przybyla et al . , 2016; Ringwald et al . , 1987 ) , and its down-regulation parallels the induction of patterning events via differential adhesion ( Figure 1A ) . In this study , we explored whether mechanical manipulation of human induced pluripotent stem cells ( hiPSCs ) sub-populations results in controllable cell driven self-organization into repeatable patterns . We employed an inducible CRISPR interference ( CRISPRi ) system in hiPSCs to silence key proteins that regulate cell adhesion and cortical tension . We genetically induced controlled symmetry-breaking events within hiPSC populations by creating mixed populations of hiPSCs with and without the CRISPRi system and then induced mosaic knockdown ( KD ) . Mosaic KD was employed to interrogate how the creation of physical asymmetries in an otherwise homogeneous population leads to multicellular organization and pattern formation . We show that induction of mosaic KD of ROCK1 or CDH1 results in a \u2018bottom-up\u2019 cell-driven pattern formation of hiPSC colonies while preserving pluripotency . \n To establish an inducible CRISPRi KD of ROCK1 or CDH1 , we used a doxycycline ( DOX ) -inducible CRISPRi hiPSC line ( CRISPRi-Gen1C ) ( Mandegar et al . , 2016 ) ( Figure 1B ) . Guide RNA ( gRNA ) sequences designed to target the transcription start site of ROCK1 or CDH1 ( Supplementary file 1 - Table 1 ) were introduced into CRISPR-Gen1C hiPSCs and KD was induced by the addition of DOX ( 2 \u03bcM ) into cell culture media . After 3 days of KD induction , ROCK1 mRNA levels were\u00a0<30% of hiPSCs without DOX treatment , and CDH1 mRNA levels in CDH1 KD hiPSCs were\u00a0<10% compared to untreated controls ( Figure 1C ) . Protein KD followed a similar trend where KD populations compared to untreated controls resulted in\u00a0<20% ROCK1 protein and\u00a0<10% of CDH1 protein by day three of DOX treatment , and reduced protein levels were maintained through day six of CRISPRi induction ( Figure 1C , Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . Both the ROCK1 KD cells and the CDH1 KD cells retained epithelial hiPSC morphologies without single cell migration away from the colonies ( Figure 1D ) . However , CDH1 KD hiPSCs displayed irregular colony shapes that maintained smooth peripheral edges , but contained regions lacking cells within colonies ( Figure 1D ) . Conversely , ROCK1 KD hiPSCs displayed round colony shapes ( similar to wildtype hiPSCs ) but individual cells along the border of ROCK1 KD colonies extended protrusions out away from the colony ( Figure 1D ) . As expected , hiPSCs treated with the small-molecule ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 yielded a similar morphology to the ROCK1 KD hiPSCs with extended cell protrusions at the colony borders ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . To further confirm the physical effects of knocking down CDH1 or ROCK1 selectively in hiPSCs , we performed immunofluorescent ( IF ) staining of CDH1 expression . After 5 days of DOX treatment , CDH1 KD hiPSCs exhibited a complete loss of CDH1 expression , as expected , whereas the ROCK1 KD hiPSCs and the control hiPSCs ( with off-target CRISPRi guide ) maintained robust expression of CDH1 along the plasma membrane ( Figure 1E ) . To interrogate cell cortical tension , the contact angles between cells were measured based on IF of zona occluden-1 ( ZO1 ) , a protein associated with tight junctions ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3A ) . Contact angles were not statistically different in either the ROCK1 KD or CDH1 KD cells compared to the control , but all populations displayed a subtle reduction in mean contact angle with DOX addition that was not significantly different between any of the groups ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3B ) . However , when direct measurements of hiPSC elasticity were taken using atomic force microscopy after 6 days of KD , ROCK1 KD cells displayed a twofold higher cortical stiffness than the control and CDH1 KD populations , whereas the latter groups did not differ from one another ( Figure 1F ) . Therefore , CRISPRi silencing of targeted genes associated with cellular mechanical properties resulted in distinct physical differences between the otherwise similar cell populations . To examine whether mosaic KD of a single molecule impacted hiPSC organization , ROCK1- or CDH1-CRISPRi populations were pretreated with DOX for 5 days and mixed with isogenic wildtype hiPSCs that constitutively expressed GFP ( WT-GFP ) at a 1:3 ratio . Forced aggregation of ROCK1 KD: WT-GFP hiPSCs or CDH1 KD: WT-GFP hiPSCs and subsequent re-plating were used to create individual colonies of randomly mixed ROCK1 KD hiPSCs or CDH1 KD hiPSCs with the WT-GFP cells ( Figure 2A ) . After 5 days in mixed culture , ROCK1 KD cells sorted radially from the WT-GFP cells , clustering primarily at the edges of the colonies ( Figure 2B , C ) . However , separation of the ROCK1 KD cells did not result in distinct smooth borders between the WT-GFP and ROCK1 KD hiPSC populations . In contrast , CDH1 KD cells robustly separated from the GFP-WT population , forming sharp boundaries between populations irrespective of their spatial location within the colony ( Figure 2B , C ) . To determine whether pattern emergence was impacted by the relative proportion of mosaic KD within a colony , KD cells were mixed with control CRISPRi hiPSCs lacking any gRNA or fluorescent protein at varying cell ratios of 1:1 , 1:3 , and 3:1 . Clustering of ROCK1 KD cells was less apparent as the proportion of ROCK1 KD cells within a colony increased . In fact , increasing ROCK1 KD hiPSCs to 75% of the colony resulted in the entire colony morphology displaying characteristics of a pure ROCK1 KD colony ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . On the other hand , the CDH1 CRISPRi cells separated from the colorless CRISPRi population , irrespective of cell ratio , indicating that the spatial organization occurred regardless of relative population size within a hiPSC colony . The ability of both the ROCK1 and CDH1 CRISPRi KD populations to physically partition from otherwise identical CRISPRi-engineered hiPSCs that lacked a gRNA confirms that the production of dCas9-KRAB is not responsible for the previously observed pattern formation when CRISPRi KD hiPSCs were mixed with the WT-GFP cells , but rather that the segregation is a direct result of KD of the target gene ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . Based on the sorting behaviors of ROCK1 KD: WT-GFP and CDH1 KD: WT-GFP colonies when the KD of ROCK1 or CDH1 was present at the time of mixing , we next examined whether induction of mosaic KD after mixing resulted in similar sorting patterns as previously observed . This scenario more accurately models the onset of initial symmetry-breaking events among homogeneous pluripotent cells during embryonic development . Non-induced CRISPRi populations were mixed with WT-GFP hiPSCs ( 1:3 ratio ) , re-plated , and then treated with DOX to induce KD ( Figure 2E ) . ROCK1 KD post-mixing within mosaic colonies did not result in noticeable radial segregation of ROCK1 KD hiPSCs from WT-GFP hiPSCs ( Figure 2F\u2013H ) , as observed for pre-mixed colonies . Instead , the post-mixing ROCK1 mosaic KD colonies exhibited greater vertical stacking of ROCK1 KD cells and WT-GFP cells in the z-plane of the mixed colonies ( Figure 2G ) , whereas the pre-induced mixed colonies remained segregated primarily in a 2D planar manner ( Figure 2C ) . In contrast , the mosaic silencing of CDH1 post-mixing maintained robust segregation of the CDH1 KD cells from the WT-GFP hiPSCs , although the borders between cell populations lacking CDH1 contacts and neighboring WT-GFP cells were somewhat less distinct than the pre-induced CDH1 KD: WT-GFP mixed colonies . Overall , the inducible CRISPRi mixed colonies displayed the ability to mimic several different patterns of intrinsic symmetry-breaking events that resulted in distinct cell sorting and multicellular pattern formation . In addition to the changes in organization within colonies , significant changes were observed in the final cell ratios starting from an original seeding density of 3:1 WT to CRISPRi cells . The proportion of CRISPRi cells increased within the mixed colonies over time ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2A ) . To determine if the accelerated growth was in response to mixing with a WT population , EdU incorporation was analyzed in pure CRISPRi and WT populations . Over 5 days of mixed culture , the WT-GFP cells displayed approximately 50% reduced DNA synthesis compared to the CRISPRi lines independent of DOX treatment ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2B ) , however cell replication rate did not account for pattern formation as the CRISPRi control mixed colonies did not display evidence of any patterns . Colony morphology and expression of epithelial markers , such as epithelial cell adhesion molecule ( EpCAM ) , were examined to determine if the cells that lost CDH1 expression segregated from their WT-GFP neighbors due to delamination , or loss of the epithelial phenotype characteristic of hiPSCs . ROCK1 KD: WT-GFP and CDH1 KD: WT-GFP colonies maintained an epithelial morphology throughout 6 days of CRISPRi silencing ( Figure 3A ) with no observed migration by CRISPRi-modulated cells away from the colonies . Both ROCK1 KD and CDH1 KD hiPSCs within mixed colonies expressed EpCAM at cell-cell boundaries after 6 days of CRISPRi induction despite changes in cortical tension or intercellular adhesion due to loss of ROCK1 or CDH1 , respectively ( Figure 3A ) . Furthermore , ROCK1/CDH1 KD hiPSCs displayed cell junction-localized \u03b2-catenin in pure colonies after 6 days of CRISPRi induction , suggesting maintenance of adherens junctions and epithelial colonies ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A ) . Since the decrease of CDH1 is commonly associated with loss of pluripotency in PSCs , the expression and localization of the common pluripotency transcription factors , OCT3/4 and SOX2 , were examined . Both proteins maintained strong nuclear expression in pure ROCK1 KD or CDH1 KD colonies after 6 days of KD induction ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2A ) . Moreover , despite the physical segregation of cells induced by KD in mixed populations , no pattern could be observed based on pluripotency marker expression ( Figure 3B ) . Furthermore , the abundance of OCT3/4 and SOX2 transcripts was unchanged in pure colonies of CDH1 KD cells and not significantly different , though variable , in pure colonies of ROCK1 KD hiPSCs ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2B ) . However because the transcription factors SOX2 and OCT4 are retained by cells for a period of time during the process of differentiation , genes associated with the primitive streak ( Brachyury [BRA] ) and the neural crest ( SOX9 ) were interrogated in either ROCK1 or CDH1 KD cells over 6 days ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2C ) . Both BRA and SOX9 were significantly increased on day three of KD in ROCK1 KD cells , however at day six the gene expression returned to levels comparable to day zero before ROCK1 KD . Although the CDH1 KD cells did not display any significant trends , the standard deviation of gene expression varied as much as three times greater than that of the ROCK1 KD cells . The high variation between biological replicates potentially indicates that silencing of CDH1 induces a large variability in the gene regulation of BRA and SOX9 and could indicate that the cells experience a transient fluctuation in the pluripotency state . However , these results indicate that the loss of ROCK1 or CDH1 is not sufficient to disrupt the pluripotent gene regulatory network and induce an immediate exit from the pluripotent state . Since pluripotency markers were maintained irrespective of mosaic patterning , gene expression changes in pluripotency markers ( SOX2 , NANOG ) , mesendoderm markers ( SOX17 , BRA ) and ectoderm markers ( PAX6 , SOX9 ) were examined during the course of mosaic patterning at days 1 , 3 and 6 after KD induction ( Figure 4A ) . To take into account potential gene expression changes that result from mixing hiPSC lines , un-induced mixed populations and un-induced pure populations were analyzed as controls . BRA did not change significantly with induction of ROCK1 KD or CDH1 KD in a mixed population , however SOX9 increased on day six of KD in both ROCK1 KD and CDH1 KD cells ( Figure 4C , D ) . Interestingly , similar to pure populations , there was a large variance in gene expression between biological replicates , often displaying more than a onefold change difference in gene expression between biological replicates in mixed colonies . To assess whether gene expression changes were unique to the induction of symmetry breaking events in mixed populations or simply a result of gene KD , a curated set of genes involved in pluripotent stem cell signaling , early lineage fate transitions , and regulation of physical cell properties ( Supplementary file 1 - Table 2 ) was examined in both pure KD populations and mixed KD populations . An ANOVA analysis was used to examine gene expression changes that could be attributed to mixing two different cell types ( mixed populations without KD ) , to KD of ROCK1 or CDH1 in a pure population , and to mosaic KD or KD in the presence of a WT neighbor ( Figure 4E , F ) . Overall , few changes in gene expression resulted from mixing un-induced CRISPRi populations with WT-GFP ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A ) , and therefore all subsequent data were normalized to pure un-induced populations and then to mixed un-induced populations to minimize false positives that resulted from mixing of cell lines without induction of KD . In ROCK1 KD cells mixed with WT , the gene expression changes on day one that could be attributed solely to gene KD ( Figure 4E , left column ) were associated with primitive streak formation ( Snail ( SNAI1 ) , SMAD1 ) . On day three , an upregulation of adhesion molecules ( EPHA4 , ITGA4 ) was observed , as well as NANOG , Nestin ( NES ) , and TGF\u03b2 upregulation and FGFR2 down-regulation . Interestingly , a large number of changes in gene expression were specific to the mosaic induction of ROCK1 KD ( Figure 4E , right column ) , for example the down-regulation of both cell-cell adhesions as well as cell-ECM adhesions . Additionally , genes that were upregulated in the pure KD context were down-regulated in the mosaic KD context , such as SNAI1 , NES and NANOG . However , at day six of mosaic KD no significant changes persisted in the examined panel of genes ( Figure 4E ) . CDH1 KD caused an upregulation in genes associated with cell-cell adhesion on day one that was exacerbated in a mosaic CDH1 KD ( Figure 4F ) . Interestingly , both Wnt3 and down-stream Wnt targets , such as SNAI1 and SNAI2 , were significantly increased specifically in mosaic KDs on day one\u00a0of KD . Similar to the transient wave of gene expression changes observed in ROCK1 KD cells , mosaic CDH1 KD did not exhibit any observed significant changes on day six of KD except for CDH1 ( Figure 4F ) . These results were consistent with our previous observation of the maintenance of pluripotency in the ROCK1 KD: WT-GFP and CDH1 KD: WT-GFP colonies ( Figure 3 ) . Furthermore , the recovery of homeostatic gene expression profiles closely followed the dynamics of distinct pattern establishment in the mixed populations . In addition to examining the KD cells , we examined the gene expression profiles of the neighboring WT cells that constituted the majority of cells in each colony . On day six of KD induction , the WT-GFP cells that were mixed with CDH1 KD hiPSCs had gene expression patterns that resembled the WT-GFP cells mixed with the control CRISPRi populations , whereas the WT-GFP cells mixed with ROCK1 KD hiPSCs exhibited a different expression profile . Interestingly , the WT-GFP cells mixed with ROCK1 CRISPRi hiPSCs demonstrated changes in genes associated with cell sorting and movement , such as ephrins and integrins , and up-regulation in myosin proteins ( MYH9 , MYH10 ) ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B , C ) . Overall , the changes in the WT-GFP hiPSC gene expression suggests that targeted manipulation of gene expression in an emerging sub-population can exert non-cell\u2013\ufeffautonomous effects on the opposing population and may be influenced by the respective multicellular organization of the two populations . Controllable induction of two distinct populations of hPSC offers the potential for co-emergence of multiple differentiated cell populations in a predictable manner . To examine how mosaic patterning of hPSC could direct co-emergence of differentiated progeny , two independent differentiation protocols were performed to direct the hiPSCs to either an ectodermal or mesendodermal fate ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2A ) . The proportion of PAX6\u00a0+cells , indicating neuro-ectoderm lineage , or eomesodermin ( EOMES ) +cells , indicating a mesendoderm lineage , in the WT and CRISPRi mixed populations were examined . Although the ROCK1 KD population did not display a significant difference in PAX6\u00a0+or EOMES\u00a0+cells relative to the WT cells ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2B-D ) , the CDH1 KD population yielded fewer PAX6\u00a0+cells with the ectoderm directed differentiation and increased EOMES\u00a0+cells in the mesendoderm-directed differentiation ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2B-D ) . Overall , these studies demonstrate the potent ability to direct multicellular organization of hPSCs prior to the acquisition of differentiated cell fate . \n In this study we examined the effect of inducing specific genetic KD in subpopulations of hiPSCs within an otherwise homogeneous population of pluripotent cells . Historically , small-molecule chemical inhibitors , antibodies , and homogeneous genetic knockouts are often used to interrogate the molecular mechanisms involved in morphogenesis ( Lecuit and Lenne , 2007; McBeath et al . , 2004; Salbreux et al . , 2012 ) . However , these methods can\u2019t selectively discriminate between different cells , or they fail to address how the emergence of heterotypic interactions affects multicellular organization . Here , we report that silencing of target genes by CRISPRi within only subpopulations of cells provides multiple avenues to genetically control the emergence of asymmetric cell phenotypes and development of multicellular patterns . Specifically , we demonstrate that mosaic KD of target genes ROCK1 or CDH1 result in distinct patterning events wherein cell-driven segregation dictates colony organization without loss of pluripotency ( Figure 5 ) . ROCK1 regulates actin-myosin contraction ( McBeath et al . , 2004 ) and facilitates expansion of PSCs ( Ohgushi et al . , 2015; Park et al . , 2015 ) , and its acute inhibition by small molecules leads to a \u2018relaxed\u2019 cell phenotype with decreased stiffness ( Kinney et al . , 2014; Lee et al . , 2006 ) . However , we found that prolonged silencing of ROCK1 in hiPSCs ( 6 days ) resulted in cells that were twofold stiffer than either the CDH1 KD cells or the control CRISPRi cells . The increased cortical stiffness of ROCK1 KD hiPSCs could be due to the difference between the inhibition of an existing protein and KD of the gene . A small molecule inhibitor prevents the function of already existing proteins so that a small amount of functioning protein may escape the inhibitor\u2019s influence . In contrast , CRISPRi only needs to target the ROCK1 gene loci at two alleles to completely abolish protein transcription , thus highlighting the strength of genetic perturbation . Additionally , ROCK inhibition is often used as a transient perturbation ( 24 hr ) , whereas long-term KD of ROCK1 ( 6 days ) may induce compensatory effects within the cells that are responsible for the somewhat surprising results . Long-term ROCK1 KD compensation is a likely partial explanation why KD of ROCK1 prior to mixing resulted in radially partitioned populations , but post-mixing KD resulted in less segregated populations . The increased stacking of the ROCK1 KD population upon induction of knockdown after mixing with WT cells could also reflect the difference between short-term and long-term ROCK1 KD and potential compensation effects . For example , the 3D accumulation of ROCK1 KD cells as cytoskeletal contraction is impaired may be a result from compensatory contraction by the surrounding WT cells , resulting in multilayer colonies . The emergence of autonomous cell patterning and cell sorting is often coincident with the onset of differentiation , and CDH1 in particular regulates morphogenesis in a diverse range of species ( Burdsal et al . , 1993; Li et al . , 2010 ) . Historically , CDH1 is often associated with pluripotency in mouse embryonic stem cells ( Li et al . , 2012; Soncin and Ward , 2011 ) . However , while CDH1 is commonly expressed by pluripotent cells and CDH1 can replace OCT3/4 during fibroblast reprogramming to pluripotency ( Redmer et al . , 2011 ) , CDH1 is not essential to pluripotency ( Larue et al . , 1996; Soncin et al . , 2009; Ying et al . , 2008 ) . Our results reinforce these latter observations by demonstrating that CDH1 KD in hiPSCs does not adversely affect the expression of pluripotency markers nor lead to a loss of epithelial phenotype . The maintenance of pluripotent state indicates that KD of CDH1 alone is not sufficient to induce differentiation , but other factors such as sufficient cell density and local intercellular signaling preserve pluripotent colony integrity and buffer against changes in cell state . Furthermore , the observed maintenance of pluripotency and preferential differentiation to mesendoderm is consistent with recent studies revealing that changes in human CDH1 adhesions coordinate with in vitro human stem cell lineage decisions rather than pluripotency maintenance ( Przybyla et al . , 2016 ) . Changes in CDH1 influencing lineage fate decisions may explain the transient gene expression changes that we observed with the induction of KD in mixed colonies , where the loss of CDH1 potentially primes the cells to respond to a signal for differentiation , and without such a signal the cells return to a ground state of pluripotency . Similar priming has been described in the context of cell-matrix adhesion where differentiation in response to TGF\u03b2 signaling is primed by stiffness-dependent integrin signaling ( Allen et al . , 2012 ) ; a similar mechanism may explain the observed transient gene expression changes without loss of pluripotency in CDH1 KD hiPSCs . The ability to manipulate distinct cell populations allows for robust modeling of human morphogenic events and , thus , an expanded understanding of human biology that can be exploited to develop physiologically realistic in vitro human tissue models . Cellular location within pluripotent colonies can be thought to parallel the effects seen in early developing blastocysts . A cell\u2019s location within the early embryo relays signals that dictate initial symmetry-breaking events , such as the decision to become trophectoderm instead of inner cell mass . Cells located within the center of an embryo maintain different adhesion contacts ( Stephenson et al . , 2010 ) and are subjected to higher tension generated by neighboring cells ( Samarage et al . , 2015 ) , which then feed back into lineage fate decisions . For example , the Hippo pathway is controlled by a cell\u2019s position within the early blastocyst , where the outer cell layer has the ability to polarize and sequester the signaling molecule angiomotin away from adherens junctions , preventing the phosphorylation and activation that would occur in an internal cell that maintained cell-cell contacts on all sides ( Hirate et al . , 2013 ) . Additionally in vitro micro-patterned PSC colonies have been reported to display spatially dependent germ layer patterning upon differentiation ( Etoc et al . , 2016; Tewary et al . , 2017; Warmflash et al . , 2014 ) . The observed mosaic patterns of ROCK1 KD hiPSCs demonstrate that the spatial location within a colony can be affected by targeted gene KD without altering differentiation potential , and conversely , the mosaic CDH1 KD demonstrates dual control of spatial positioning and lineage potential . Therefore , the system described here enables interrogation of multicellular organization and morphogenic processes in parallel via manipulation of local multicellular domains through subpopulation organization and priming to specific lineage fates . In addition to changes in multicellular organization as a result of ROCK1 or CDH1 KD , changes in gene expression also occurred in the WT population . In particular , the WT population displayed significant changes in several genes associated with adhesion and lineage fate . For example , GATA4 was down-regulated in WT cells in all mixed colonies . GATA4 is expressed by mesendoderm lineages ( Molkentin et al . , 1997; Zorn and Wells , 2009 ) and its down-regulation may affect the ability of WT cells to properly differentiate to mesendoderm . However , there were no significant differences in EOMES expression between the WT and CRISPRi cells when ROCK1 KD mixed colonies were directed toward a mesendodermal fate ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2 ) , potentially due to the strength of the small molecule CHIR , a GSK3 inhibitor , in inducing mesendoderm fate . Additionally , differences between the WT and ROCK1 KD populations may arise in longer differentiations , where the cells are allowed to mature beyond a progenitor stage . However , differences in maturation or cell type within a germ lineage may assist in the controlled co-emergence of multiple cell types that normally interact within a single tissue , such as parenchymal cells along with stromal populations . Overall , this study capitalized on the ability of CRISPRi to temporally perturb specific molecular regulators of physical cell properties , such as adhesion and tension , that resulted in differing multicellular patterns . Moreover , CRISPRi additionally offers the flexibility to target any gene of interest and timing of KD ( Gordon et al . , 2016; Mandegar et al . , 2016 ) , allowing for the creation of dynamic patterns through transient genetic KD that could be used to pre-pattern PSC colonies in various types of multicellular geometries before differentiation . Additionally , the ability to induce molecular asymmetry can also be applied to co-differentiation , where the temporal induction of specific heterotypic interactions , such as the presentation of a ligand or receptor , can give rise to the coordinated emergence of two ( or more ) cell types under the same culture conditions . In addition , mosaic induction of KD can be used to examine how signals propagate between cells , for example , interrogating how the networks between cells created by either mechanical ( adhesions ) or chemical gradients ( gap junctions ) affect lineage fate decisions . Furthermore , the predictable patterning events and potential for control over co-emergence that we establish in this study could aid the eventual control over morphogenic events in organoid systems . Organoids require coordinated heterotypic interactions in a 3D environment in order to self-organize ( Bredenoord et al . , 2017; Sasai , 2013 ) ; the ability to precisely predict and control the organization of multiple cell types in parallel would significantly improve the reproducibility and robustness of in vitro tissue modeling . Ultimately , this study identifies a novel strategy to direct the emergence of heterotypic cell populations to control multicellular organization in pluripotent stem cells , and subsequently facilitates the creation of robust models of morphogenesis necessary for the mechanistic study of human developmental tissue patterning and formation . \n All work with hiPSC lines was approved by the University of California , San Francisco Human Gamete , Embryo and Stem Cell Research ( GESCR ) Committee . Human iPSC lines were derived from the WTC 11 line ( Coriell Cat . # GM25256 ) where the species of origin was confirmed by a LINE assay . After genetic manipulation , all cell lines were karyotyped by Cell Line Genetics and were deemed karyotypically normal before proceeding with experiments ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4B ) . All cell lines tested negative for mycoplasma using a MycoAlert Mycoplasma Detection Kit ( Lonza ) . Human iPSC lines were cultured in feeder-free media conditions on growth factor-reduced Matrigel ( Corning Life Sciences ) and fed daily with mTeSRTM-1 medium ( STEMCELL Technologies ) ( Ludwig et al . , 2006 ) . Accutase ( STEMCELL Technologies ) was used to dissociate hiPSCs to single cells during passaging . Cells were passaged at a seeding density of 12 , 000 cells per cm2 and the small molecule Rho-associated coiled-coil kinase ( ROCK ) inhibitor Y-276932 ( 10 \u03bcM; Selleckchem ) was added to the media upon passaging to promote survival ( Park et al . , 2015; Watanabe et al . , 2007 ) . The generation of the ROCK1 CRISPRi line was previously created and described by Mandegar et al . , 2016 . For the generation of the CDH1 CRISPRi lines , five CRISPRi gRNAs were designed to bind within 150 bp of the TSS of CDH1 and cloned into the gRNA-CKB vector using BsmBI ligation following the previously described protocol ( Mandegar et al . , 2016 ) ( Supplementary file 1 -Table 1 ) . gRNA expression vectors were nucleofected into the CRISPRi-Gen1C human hiPSC line from the Conklin Lab using the Human Stem Cell Nucleofector Kit 1 solution with the Amaxa nucleofector 2b device ( Lonza ) . Nucleofected cells were seeded into 3 wells of a 6-well plate ( ~7400 cell/cm2 ) in mTeSRTM-1 media with Y-27632 ( 10 \u03bcM ) for 2 days , and treated with blasticidin ( ThermoFisher Scientific; 10 \u03bcg/ml ) for a selection period of 7 days . Surviving colonies were pooled and passaged in mTeSRTM-1 with blasticidin and Y-27632 for a single day then transitioned to mTeSRTM-1 media only . Once stable polyclonal populations of CDH1 CRISPRi hiPSCs for each of the five guides were established , the cells were incubated with doxycycline ( 2 \u03bcM ) for 96 hr . KD efficiency was evaluated by mRNA collection and subsequent qPCR , comparing levels of transcript with a time-matched control of the same line without CRISPRi induction . The CRISPRi CDH1 cell line with the guide producing the best KD was selected ( gRNA \u22126 ) . To generate the WT-GFP line , 2 million WTC clone11 hiPSCs were nucleofected as previously described with the knock-in plasmid containing a CAG promoter-driven EGFP and AAVS1 TALEN pair vectors ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4A ) . After cell recovery , puromycin ( 0 . 5 \u03bcg/ml ) was added to the media for a selection period of 7 days . Individual stable EGFP-expressing colonies were picked using an EVOS FL microscope ( Life Technologies ) and transferred to individual wells of a 24-well plate in mTeSR media with Y-27632 ( 10 \u03bcM ) and subsequently expanded into larger vessels . Cell aggregates of\u00a0~100 cells were created using 400 \u00d7 400 \u03bcm PDMS microwell inserts in 24-well plates ( ~975 microwell per well ) similar to previously published protocols ( Hookway et al . , 2016; Ungrin et al . , 2008 ) . Dissociated hiPSC cultures were resuspended in mTeSRTM-1 supplemented with Y-27632 ( 10 \u03bcM ) , mixed at proper ratios and concentration ( 100 cells/well ) , added to microwells , and centrifuged ( 200 rcf ) . After 18 hr of formation , 100 cell aggregates were transferred in mTeSRTM-1 to Matrigel-coated 96-well plates ( ~15 aggregates/cm2 ) and allowed to spread into 2D colonies . Human iPSCs were washed with cold PBS , incubated for 10 min on ice in RIPA Buffer ( Sigma-Aldrich ) , and supernatant collected . Three replicates were used for each condition . The supernatant protein content was determined using a Pierce BCA Protein Assay kit ( Thermofisher Scientific ) colorimetric reaction and quantified on a SpectraMax i3 Multi-Mode Platform ( Molecular Devices ) . Subsequently , 20 \u03bcg of protein from each sample was resolved by SDS-PAGE , and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane ( Invitrogen ) . The membranes were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with primary antibodies: anti-ROCK1 ( AbCAM 1:200 ) , anti-CDH1 ( AbCAM 1:200 ) , anti-GAPDH , ( Invitrogen 1:10 , 000 ) , followed by incubation ( 30 min at room temperature ) with infrared secondary antibodies: IRDye 800CW and IRDye 680CW ( LI-COR 1:13 , 000 ) , and imaged on the Odyssey Fc Imaging System ( LI-COR Biosciences ) . Protein levels were quantified using Image Studio Lite ( LI-COR Biosciences ) . Total RNA isolation was performed using an RNeasy Mini Kit ( QIAGEN ) according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions and quantified with a Nanodrop 2000c Spectrometer ( ThermoFisher Scientific ) . cDNA was synthesized by using an iScript cDNA Synthesis kit ( BIORAD ) and the reaction was run on a SimpliAmp thermal cycler ( Life Technologies ) . To quantify individual genes , qPCR reactions were run on a StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR system ( Applied Biosciences ) and detected using Fast SYBR Green Master Mix ( ThermoFisher Scientific ) . Relative gene expression was determined by normalizing to the housekeeping gene 18S rRNA , using the comparative threshold ( CT ) method . Gene expression was displayed as fold change of each sample ( ROCK1 CRISPRi or CDH1 CRISPRi ) versus the off-target guide control ( KCNH2 CRISPRi ) . The primers were designed using the NCBI Primer-BLAST website and are listed in Supplementary file 1 -Table 2 . Statistical analysis was conducted using a two-tailed unpaired t-test between any two groups ( p<0 . 05 , n\u00a0=\u00a03 ) . All AFM indentations were performed using an MFP3D-BIO inverted optical atomic force microscope ( Asylum Research ) mounted on a Nikon TE2000-U inverted fluorescent microscope . Silicon nitride cantilevers were used with spring constants ranging from 0 . 04 to 0 . 06 N/m and borosilicate glass spherical tips 5 \u00b5m in diameter ( Novascan Tech ) . Each cantilever was calibrated using the thermal oscillation method prior to each experiment . Samples were indented at 1 \u00b5m/s loading rate , with a maximum force of 4 nN . Force maps were typically obtained as a 6 \u00d7 6 raster series of indentations utilizing the FMAP function of the IGOR PRO build supplied by Asylum Research , for a total of 36 data points per area of interest measured every five microns . Two 5 micron by five micron areas of interest were sampled for each sample . The Hertz model was used to determine the elastic modulus of the sample at each point probed . Samples were assumed to be incompressible and a Poisson\u2019s ratio of 0 . 5 was used in the calculation of the Young\u2019s elastic modulus . Human iPSC colonies were imaged in 96-well plates ( ibidi ) on an inverted AxioObserver Z1 ( Ziess ) with an ORCA-Flash4 . 0 digital CMOS camera ( Hamamatsu ) . Using ZenPro software , colony locations were mapped and a single colony was imaged daily for 6 days . To obtain time-lapse movies , a single colony was imaged over the course of 12 hr at a rate of one picture taken every 30 min . Human iPSC colonies were fixed for 30 min in 4% paraformaldehyde ( VWR ) and washed 3X with PBS . Fixed colonies were permeabilized with 0 . 3% Trition X-100 ( Sigma Aldrich ) throughout blocking and antibody incubation steps . Samples were incubated in primary antibodies over night at 4\u00b0C , subsequently washed with PBS and incubated in secondary antibodies for an hour at room temperature . Primary antibodies used were: anti-OCT4 ( SantaCruz 1:400 ) , anti-SOX2 ( AbCAM 1:400 ) , anti-Zo1 ( LifeTechnologies 1:400 ) , NANOG ( AbCAM 1:300 ) , anti-\u03b2-catenin ( BD Biosciences 1:200 ) , anti-EpCAM ( Millipore 1:200 ) . All secondary antibodies were used at 1:1000 and purchased from Life Technologies . Pure populations of WT , CRISPRi KCNH2 ( control ) , CRISPRi ROCK1 , and CRISPRi CDH1 were treated with DOX ( 2 \u03bcM ) for\u00a05 consecutive days . Cultures were pulsed with EdU by supplementing Click-It EdU ( 10 \u03bcM ) to the media for 6 hr . Cultures were then washed 3X with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde ( VWR ) for 15 min and subsequently washed with PBS . Samples were permeabilized with 0 . 5% Triton-X 100 ( Sigma Aldrich ) in PBS for 20 min . Samples were then incubated with Click-It EdU detection kit as per the manufacturer\u2019s instructions ( ThermoFisher Scientific ) . Samples were analyzed via flow cytometry on a BD LSR-FLOW Cytometer and analysis was performed with a minimum of 10 , 000 events . Mixed hiPSC populations and pure population controls were dissociated from tissue culture plates with Accutase ( STEMCELL Technologies ) and washed with PBS . Cells were fixed for 15 min with 4% paraformaldehyde ( VWR ) and washed 3X for 3 min with PBS . Samples were incubated in Hoescht stain ( 1:10 , 000 ) for 30 min and run on a LSR-II analyzer ( BD Biosciences ) to detect the ratio of WT-GFP ( + ) to CRISPRi mCherry ( + ) populations , as well as % of EdU\u00a0+cells . Analysis was conducted with a minimum of 10 , 000 events per sample . Mixed hiPSC populations and pure population controls were dissociated from tissue culture plates and washed 3X with PBS . A LIVE/DEAD stain ( ThermoFisher Scientific ) was used per manufacture instructions . Prior to sorting , cells were suspended in PBS supplemented with Y-27632 ( 10 \u03bcM ) and kept on ice . A BD FACSAria II cell sorter ( BD Biosciences ) was used to isolate pure populations of WT-GFP and CRISPRi hiPSCs by first identifying the live cells via the LIVE/DEAD ( 350 ) stain and subsequently sorting the mCherry ( + ) GFP ( - ) populations from the mCherry ( - ) GFP ( + ) populations directly into TRIzol LS Reagent ( ThermoFisher Scientifc ) . Samples were then stored at \u221280\u00b0C until subsequent mRNA extraction . Sorted hiPSCs stored in TRIzol LS were thawed on ice and mRNA was extracted using a Direct-zol RNA MiniPrep Plus kit ( ZYMO Research ) following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions . RNA was converted to cDNA using the iScript cDNA synthesis kit ( Bio-Rad ) . Forward and reverse primers for genes were designed using NCBI\u2019s Primer-BLAST ( Supplementary file 1 - Table 3 ) . Primers were pooled to 500 nM to enable specific-target amplification and cDNA was amplified with PreAmp Master Mix ( Fluidigm ) and pooled primers for 15 cycles . Pre-amplified samples mixed with 2X SsoFast EvaGreen Supermix with low ROX ( Bio-Rad ) and 20X DNA Binding Dye Sample Loading Reagent ( Fluidigm ) , and 10 \u03bcM primer sets were mixed with 2X Assay Loading Reagent ( Fluidigm ) . 5 \u03bcl of diluted cDNA and primers and were loaded onto the IFC chip per manufacturer\u2019s instructions and loaded into the chip using the IFC Controller HX ( Fluidigm ) . qPCR was run for 40 cycles in the IFC chip using the BioMark HD in the BioMark HD Data Collection Software . Resulting data was analyzed in the Real-Time PCR Analysis Software . All instruments and software involved with the IFC chip were manufactured by Fluidigm . Gene expression levels were calculated with respect to time-matched pure populations of WT hiPSCs , and hierarchically clustered and plotted using Genesis software ( Institute for Genomics and Bioinformatics , Graz University of Technology ) . For the dual SMAD and CHIR germ lineage differentiations , 100 cell mixed colonies were generated as previously described , cultured in mTeSRTM-1 medium ( STEMCELL Technologies ) , and allowed to form patterns for 5 days in pluripotency maintenance conditions . After 5 days , the media was supplemented with either SB 435142 ( 10\u03bcM; Stemgent ) and LDN 193189 ( 0 . 2\u03bcM; Sigma-Aldrich ) or CHIR 99021 ( 12\u03bcM; Selleckchem ) . CHIR was pulsed for 24 hr periods on the first and fourth day of the mesendoderm directed differentiation . Dual SMAD inhibition was kept constant for 6 days by supplementing SB 435142 and LDN 193189 into MTeSR media to direct germ lineage to an ectodermal fate . After 6 days of differentiation , colonies were washed 3X with PBS and fixed for staining with 4% paraformaldehyde ( VWR ) as previously described . For the radial position computational analysis , fluorescent images were split into single RGB channel images using the Python module scikit-image ( scikit-image contributors et al . , 2014 ) where the red channel denoted CRISPRi cells , the green channel denoted WT cells , and the blue channel denoted DAPI staining of the entire colony . A mask of each channel was created by thresholding , removing small objects , and removing small holes . The radius ( r ) of each colony was calculated using the DAPI mask and the ratio of inner red cell area vs . outer red cell area was calculated by taking the logical AND of the red channel mask and the DAPI mask above \u00be r vs the logical AND of the red channel mask and the DAPI mask below \u00bc r and normalizing to the total red mask area . To ensure accuracy , the inner vs . outer red ratio was averaged with the inverse of the inner vs . outer green ratio ( calculated in the same manner using the green channel mask ) . For the differentiation analysis , fluorescent images were split into single RGB channels where the red channel denoted CRISPRi cells ( mCherry+ ) , the green channel denoted WT cells ( GFP+ ) , and the blue channel denoted either PAX6 or EOMES positive cells . The pixel area of cell types was determined by thresholding the WT , CRISPRi , or EOMES/PAX6\u00a0+images before \u2018removing small objects\u2019 and \u2018removing small holes\u2019 to create a mask of the area covered by each individual cell type . The EOMES or PAX6\u00a0+population was calculated by taking the logical AND of either the WT and EOMES/PAX6\u00a0+mask or the CRISPRi and the EOMES/PAX6\u00a0+masks and then normalizing to the total area of the WT or CRISPRi mask , respectively . The ratio of EOMES/PAX6\u00a0+cells in CRISPRi cell compared to WT was calculated by dividing the normalized EOMES/PAX6\u00a0+area of the CRISPRi mask by the normalized EOMES/PAX6\u00a0+area of the WT mask . To ensure unbiased sampling of colonies in all cell mixing experiments , 10 colonies were randomly chosen on day zero before pattern formation and imaged daily thereafter . Each experiment was performed with at least three biological replicates . Unpaired T-tests were used to compare two groups . One-way analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) was used to compare three or more groups , followed by post-hoc pairwise comparisons by Tukey\u2019s tests . In gene expression analysis , three replicates were used for each condition , and all gene expression was normalized to control mixed populations ( off-target guide without knockdown ) to control for any gene expression changes due to mixing or the process of FACS sorting . In all comparisons , significance was specified as p\u22640 . 05 .", "headings": ["Abstract", "Introduction", "Results", "Discussion", "Materials and methods"], "keywords": ["stem cells and regenerative medicine", "developmental biology"], "id": "elife-36045-v1"}
{"lay_summary": "You can read this sentence from beginning to end without losing track of its meaning thanks to your working memory . This system temporarily stores information relevant to whatever task you are currently performing . However , the more items you try to hold in working memory at once , the poorer the quality of each of the resulting memories . It has long been argued that this phenomenon \u2013 known as the set size effect \u2013 occurs because the brain devotes a fixed amount of neural resources to working memory . But this theory struggles to account for certain experimental results . It also fails to explain why the brain would not simply recruit more resources whenever it has more items to remember . After all , your heart does something similar by beating faster whenever you increase your physical activity . Van den Berg and Ma break with the idea that working memory resources are fixed . They propose that resource allocation is flexible and driven by two conflicting goals: maximize memory performance , but use as few neural resources as necessary . Indeed , a computer simulation that follows this strategy mimics the set size effects seen in healthy volunteers . In the model , the items most relevant for a task are stored more accurately than less important ones , a phenomenon also observed in participants . Lastly , the simulation predicts that the total amount of resources devoted to working memory will vary with the number of items to be remembered . This too is consistent with the results of previous experiments . Working memory thus appears to be more flexible than previously thought . The amount of resources that the brain allocates to working memory is not fixed but could be the result of balancing resource cost against cognitive performance . If this is confirmed , it may be possible to improve working memory by offering rewards , or by increasing the perceived importance of a task .", "article": "Encoding precision in visual working memory decreases with the number of encoded items . Here , we propose a normative theory for such set size effects: the brain minimizes a weighted sum of an error-based behavioral cost and a neural encoding cost . We construct a model from this theory and find that it predicts set size effects . Notably , these effects are mediated by probing probability , which aligns with previous empirical findings . The model accounts well for effects of both set size and probing probability on encoding precision in nine delayed-estimation experiments . Moreover , we find support for the prediction that the total amount of invested resource can vary non-monotonically with set size . Finally , we show that it is sometimes optimal to encode only a subset or even none of the relevant items in a task . Our findings raise the possibility that cognitive \"limitations\" arise from rational cost minimization rather than from constraints . \n To test the predictions of the model against empirical data , we apply it to the delayed-estimation task ( Wilken and Ma , 2004; Blake et al . , 1997; Prinzmetal et al . , 1998 ) , which is currently one of the most widely used paradigms in VWM research . In this task , the observer briefly holds a set of items in memory and then reports their estimate of a randomly probed target item ( Figure 2A ) . Set size effects manifest as a widening of the estimation error distribution as the number of items is increased ( Figure 2B ) , which suggests a decrease in the amount of resource per item ( Figure 2C ) . To apply our model to this task , we express the expected local behavioral cost as an expected value of the behavioral cost with respect to the error distribution , ( 12 ) c\u00afbehavioral , i ( J\u00afi;\u03c4 ) =\u222bcbehavioral , i ( \u03b5 ) p ( \u03b5;J\u00afi , \u03c4 ) d\u03b5 , where the behavioral cost function cbehavioral , i ( \u03b5 ) maps an encoding error \u03b5 to a cost and p ( \u03b5;J\u00afi , \u03c4 ) is the predicted distribution of \u03b5 for an item encoded with resource J\u00afi . We first specify p ( \u03b5;J\u00afi , \u03c4 ) and then turn to cbehavioral , i ( \u03b5 ) . As the task-relevant feature in delayed-estimation experiments is usually a circular variable ( color or orientation ) , we make the common assumption that \u03b5 follows a Von Mises distribution . We denote this distribution by VM ( \u03b5;J ) , where J is one-to-one related to the distribution\u2019s concentration parameter \u03ba ( Appendix 1 ) . The distribution of \u03b5 for a stimulus encoded with resource J\u00afi is found by integrating over J , p ( \u03b5;J\u00afi , \u03c4 ) =\u222bVM ( \u03b5;J ) Gamma ( J;J\u00afi , \u03c4 ) dJ Finally , we specify the behavioral cost function cbehavioral , i ( \u03b5 ) in Equation 12 , which maps an estimation error \u03b5 to a behavioral cost . As in most psychophysical experiments , human subjects tend to perform well on delayed-estimation tasks even when the reward is independent of their performance . This suggests that the behavioral cost function is strongly determined by internal incentives . A recent paper ( Sims , 2015 ) has attempted to measure this mapping and proposed a two-parameter function . We will test that proposal later , but for the moment we assume a simpler , one-parameter power-law function , cbehavioral , i ( \u03b5;\u03b2 ) =| \u03b5 |\u03b2 , where power \u03b2 is a free parameter . To obtain an intuition for the predictions of this model , we plot in Figure 2D for a specific set of parameters the two expected costs per item and their sum , Equation 11 , as a function of J\u00af . The expected behavioral cost per item depends on pi and decreases with J\u00af ( colored curves in left panel ) , while the expected neural cost per item is independent of pi and increases ( black line in left panel ) . The expected total cost per item has a unique minimum ( middle panel ) . The value of J\u00af corresponding to this minimum , J\u00afoptimal , increases with pi ( Figure 2D , right ) . Hence , in this example , the optimal amount of resource per item is an increasing function of its probing probability . We next consider the special case in which each item is equally likely to be probed , that\u00a0is , pi\u00a0=\u00a01/N . The values of pi in Figure 2D then correspond to set sizes 1 , 2 , 4 , and 8 . When replotting J\u00afoptimal as a function of N , we find a set size effect ( Figure 2E , right panel ) that is qualitatively similar to the empirical result in Figure 2C . An alternative way to understand this predicted set size effect is by considering how the three expected costs across all items , Equation 3 , depend on J\u00af . Substituting pi\u00a0=\u00a01/N in Equation 9 , we find that the expected behavioral cost across all items is independent of set size ( Figure 2E , left panel , black curve ) . Moreover , when all items are encoded with the same amount of resource ( which is necessarily the optimal solution when pi is identical across items ) , the expected neural cost across all items equals NJ\u00af and therefore scales linearly with set size ( Figure 2E , left panel , colored lines ) . The sum of these terms has a unique minimum J\u00afoptimal ( Figure 2E , center panel ) , which monotonically decreases with set size ( Figure 2E , right panel ) . The costs plotted in Figure 2E can be considered as obtained by multiplying the corresponding costs in Figure 2D by N . The model thus predicts set size effects in delayed-estimation tasks that are fully mediated by individual-item probing probability . The latter notion is consistent with empirical observations . Palmer et al . ( 1993 ) reported that \"relevant set size\" ( where irrelevance means pi\u00a0=\u00a00 ) acts virtually identically to actual set size . Emrich et al . ( 2017 ) independently varied probing probability and set size in their experiment , and found that the former was a better predictor of performance than the latter . Based on this , they hypothesized that set size effects are mediated by probing probability . The predictions of our model are qualitatively consistent with these findings . To examine how well the model accounts for set size effects in empirical data , we fit it to data from six experiments that are part of a previously published benchmark set ( E1-E6 in Table 1 ) . We use a Bayesian optimization method ( Acerbi and Ma , 2017 ) to estimate the maximum-likelihood parameter values , separately for each individual data set ( see Table 2 for a summary of these estimates ) . The model accounts well for the subject-level error distributions ( Figure 3A ) and the two statistics that summarize these distributions ( Figure 3B ) . The original benchmark set ( van den Berg et al . , 2014 ) contained four more data sets , but three of those were published in papers that were later retracted and another one contains data at only two set sizes . Although we decided to leave those four datasets out of our main analyses , the model accounts well for them too ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . We next compare the goodness of fit of the resource-rational model to that of a descriptive variant in which the amount of resource per item , J\u00af , is assumed to be a power-law function of set size ( all other aspects of the model are kept the same ) . This variant is identical to the VP-A model in our earlier work , which is one of the most accurate descriptive models currently available ( van den Berg et al . , 2014 ) . Model comparison based on the Akaike Information Criterion ( AIC ) ( Akaike , 1974 ) indicates that the data provide similar support for both models , with a small advantage for the resource-rational model ( \u0394AIC\u00a0=\u00a05 . 27\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00 . 70; throughout the paper , X\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0Y indicates mean\u00a0\u00b1s . e . m . across subjects ) . Hence , the resource-rational model provides a principled explanation of set size effects without sacrificing quality of fit compared to one of the best available descriptive models of VWM . We find that the resource-rational model also fits better than a model in which the total amount of resource is fixed and divided equally across items ( \u0394AIC\u00a0=\u00a013 . 9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01 . 4 ) . So far , we have assumed that there is random variability in the actual amount of resource assigned to an item . Next , we test an equal-precision variant of the resource-rational model , by fixing parameter \u03c4 to a very small value ( 10\u22123 ) . Consistent with the results obtained with the variable-precision model , we find that the rational model has a substantial AIC advantage over a fixed-resource model ( \u0394AIC\u00a0=\u00a043 . 0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06 . 8 ) and is on equal footing with the power-law model ( \u0394AIC\u00a0=\u00a02 . 0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01 . 7 in favor of the power-law model ) . However , all three equal-precision models ( fixed resource , power law , rational ) are outperformed by their variable-precision equivalents by over 100 AIC points . Therefore , we will only consider variable-precision models in the remainder of the paper . To get an indication of the absolute goodness of fit of the resource-rational model , we next examine how much room for improvement there is in the fits . We do this by fitting a non-parametric model variant in which resource J\u00af is a free parameter at each set size , while keeping all other aspects of the model the same . We find a marginal AIC difference , suggesting that the fits of the rational model cannot be improved much further without overfitting the data ( \u0394AIC\u00a0=\u00a03 . 49\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00 . 93 , in favor of the non-parametric model ) . An examination of the fitted parameter values corroborates this finding: the estimated resource values in the non-parametric model closely match the optimal values in the rational model ( Figure 3C ) . So far , we have assumed that behavioral cost is a power-law function of the absolute estimation error , cbehavioral ( \u03b5 ) =|\u03b5|\u03b2 . To evaluate the necessity of a free parameter in this function , we also test three parameter-free choices: |\u03b5| , \u03b52 , and \u2212cos ( \u03b5 ) . Model comparison favors the original model with AIC differences of 14 . 0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02 . 8 , 24 . 4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04 . 1 , and 19 . 5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03 . 5 , respectively . While there may be other parameter-free functions that give better fits , we expect that a free parameter is unavoidable here , as the error-to-cost mapping may differ across experiments ( because\u00a0of differences in external incentives ) and also across subjects within an experiment ( because\u00a0of differences in intrinsic motivation ) . Finally , we also test a two-parameter function that was proposed recently ( Equation ( 5 ) in Sims [2015] ) . The main difference with our original choice is that this alternative function allows for saturation effects in the error-to-cost mapping . However , this extra flexibility does not increase the goodness of fit sufficiently to justify the additional parameter , as the original model outperforms this variant with an AIC difference of 5 . 3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01 . 8 . Finally , we use five-fold cross validation to verify the AIC-based results reported in this section . We find that they are all consistent ( Table 3 ) . One quantitative feature that sets the resource-rational theory apart from previous theories is its predicted relation between set size and the total amount of invested resource , J\u00aftotal=\u2211i=1N\u2009J\u00afi . This quantity is by definition constant in fixed-resource models , and in power-law models it varies monotonically with set size . By contrast , we find that in the fits to several of the experiments , J\u00aftotal varies non-monotonically with set size ( Figure 3D , gray curves ) . To examine whether there is evidence for non-monotonic trends in the subject data , we next compute an \"empirical\" estimate J\u00aftotal=\u2211i=1N\u2009J\u00af^i , where J\u00af^i are the best-fitting resource estimates in the non-parametric model . We find that these estimates show evidence of similar non-monotonic relations in some of the experiments ( Figure 3D , black circles ) . To quantify this evidence , we perform Bayesian paired t-tests in which we compare the estimates of J\u00aftotal at set size 3 with the estimates at set sizes 1 and 6 in the experiments that included these three set sizes ( E2 and E4-E6 ) . These tests reveal strong evidence that the total amount of resource is higher at set size 3 than at set sizes 1 ( BF+0=1 . 05\u00b7107 ) and 6 ( BF+0=4 . 02\u00b7102 ) . We next compute for each subject the set size at which J\u00aftotal is largest , which we denote by Npeak , and find a subject-averaged value of 3 . 52\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00 . 18 . Altogether , these findings suggest that the total amount of resource that subjects spend on item encoding varies non-monotonically with set size , which is consistent with predictions from the resource-rational model , but not with any of the previously proposed models . To the best of our knowledge , evidence for a possible non-monotonicity in the relation between set size and total encoding resource has not been reported before . As we noted before , the model predictions do not explicitly depend on set size , N . Yet , we found that the model accounts well for set size effects in the experiments that we considered so far ( E1-E6 ) . This happens because in all those experiments , N was directly coupled with probing probability pi , through pi\u00a0=\u00a01/N . This coupling makes it impossible to determine whether changes in subjects\u2019 encoding precision are the\u00a0result\u00a0of changes in N or changes in pi . Therefore , we will next consider experiments in which individual probing probabilities and set size were varied independently of each other ( E7-E9 in Table 1 ) . According to our model , the effects of N that we found in E1-E6 were really effects of pi . Therefore , we should be able to make predictions about effects of pi in E7-E9 by recasting the effects of N in E1-E6 as effects of pi\u00a0=\u00a01/N . Given that the amount of resource per item in E1-E6 decreases with N , a first prediction is that it should increase as a function of pi in E7-E9 . A second and particularly interesting prediction is that the estimated total amount of invested resource should vary non-monotonically with pi and peak at a value ppeak that is close to 1/Npeak found in E1-E6 ( see previous section ) . Based on the values of Npeak in experiments E1-E6 , we find a prediction ppeak\u00a0=\u00a00 . 358\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00 . 026 . To test the predictions presented in the previous section and , more generally , to evaluate how well our model accounts for effects of pi on encoding precision , we fit it to data from three experiments in which probing probability was varied independently of set size ( E7-E9 in Table 1 ) . In the first of these experiments ( E7 ) , seven subjects performed a delayed-estimation task at set sizes 2 , 4 , and 8 . On each trial , one of the items \u2013 indicated with a cue \u2013 was three times more likely to be probed than any of the other items . Hence , the probing probabilities for the cued and uncued items were 3/4 and 1/4 at N\u00a0=\u00a02 , respectively , 1/2 and 1/6 at N\u00a0=\u00a04 , and 3/10 and 1/10 at N\u00a0=\u00a08 . The subject data show a clear effect of pi: the higher the probing probability of an item , the more precise the subject responses ( Figure 4A , top row , black circles ) . We find that the resource-rational model , Equation ( 11 ) , accounts well for this effect ( Figure 4A , top row , curves ) and does so by increasing the amount of resource as a function of probing probability pi ( Figure 4B , left panel , red curves ) . In the other two experiments ( E8 and E9 ) , the number of cued items and cue validity were varied between conditions , while set size was kept constant at 4 or 6 . For example , in one of the conditions of E8 , three of the four items were cued with 100% validity , such that pi was 1/3 for each cued item and 0 for the uncued item; in another condition of the same experiment , two of the four items were cued with 66 . 7% validity , meaning that pi was 1/3 for each cued item and 1/6 for each uncued item . The unique values of pi across all conditions were {0 , 1/6 , 2/9 , 1/4 , 1/3 , 1/2 , 1} in E8 and {0 , 1/12 , 1/10 , 2/15 , 1/6 , 1/3 , 1/2 , and 1} in E9 . As in E7 , responses become more precise with increasing pi and the model accounts well for this ( Figure 4A ) , again by increasing the amount of resource assigned to an item with pi ( Figure 4B ) . We next examine how our model compares to the models proposed in the papers that originally published these three data\u00a0sets . In contrast to our model , both Bays ( 2014 ) and Emrich et al . ( 2017 ) proposed that the total amount of invested resource is fixed . However , while Bays proposed that the distribution of this resource is in accordance with minimization of a behavioral cost function ( as in our model ) , Emrich et al . postulated that the resource is distributed in proportion to each item\u2019s probing probability . Hence , while our model optimizes both the amount of invested resource and its distribution , Bays\u2019 model only optimizes the distribution , and Emrich et al . \u2019s model does not explicitly optimize anything . To examine how the three proposals compare in terms of how well they account for the data , we fit two variants of our model that encapsulate the main assumptions of these two earlier proposals . In the first variant , we compute J\u00afoptimal as argminbfJ\u00af\u2009[ \u2211i=1N\u2009pic\u00afbehavioral ( J\u00afi;\u03b2 , \u03c4 ) ] under the constraint \u2211i=1N\u2009J\u00afi=J\u00aftotal , which is consistent with Bays\u2019 proposal . Hence , in this variant , the neural cost function is removed and parameter \u03bb is replaced by a parameter J\u00aftotal \u2013 otherwise , all aspects of the model are the same as in our main model . In the variant that we use to test Emrich et al . \u2019s proposal , we compute J\u00afi for each item as piJ\u00aftotal , where pi is the probing probability and J\u00aftotal is again a free parameter that represents the total amount of resource . Fitting the models to the data from all 47 subjects in E7-E9 , we find a substantial advantage of our model over the proposal by Emrich et al . , with an AIC difference of 18 . 0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03 . 9 . However , our model cannot reliably be distinguished from the proposal by Bays: either model is preferred in about half of the subjects ( our model: 27; Bays: 20 ) and the subject-averaged AIC difference is negligible ( 1 . 8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02 . 5 in favor of our model ) . Hence , the model comparison suggests quite convincingly that subjects distribute their resource near-optimally across items with unequal probing probabilities , but it is inconclusive regarding the question of\u00a0whether the total amount of invested resource is fixed or optimized . As an alternative way to address the question of whether the total amount of resource is fixed , we again fit a non-parametric model to obtain \u201cempirical\u201d estimates of the total amount of invested resource . To this end , we define J\u00af^total=J\u00af^i/pi , where J\u00af^i are the best-fitting values in a non-parametric model , such that J\u00af^total represents the estimated total amount of resource that a subject would invest to encode a display filled with items that all have probing probability pi . We find that these estimates show signs of a non-monotonicity as a function of pi ( Figure 4B , black points ) , which are captured reasonably well by the resource-rational model ( Figure 4B , black curves ) . Averaged across all subjects in E7-E9 , the value of pi at which J\u00af^total is largest is 0 . 384\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00 . 037 , which is close to the predicted value of 0 . 358\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00 . 026 ( see previous section ) . Indeed , a Bayesian independent-samples t-test supports the null hypothesis that there is no difference ( BF01\u00a0=\u00a04 . 27 ) . Hence , while the model comparison results in the previous paragraph were inconclusive regarding the question\u00a0of whether the total amount of invested resource is fixed or optimized , the present analysis provides evidence against fixed-resource models and confirms a prediction made by our own model . In summary , the results in this section show that effects of probing probability in E7-E9 are well accounted for by the same model as we used to explain effects of set size in E1-E6 . Regardless of whether total resource is fixed or optimized , this finding provides further support for the suggestion that set size effects are mediated by probing probability ( Emrich et al . , 2017 ) or , more generally , by item relevance ( Palmer et al . , 1993 ) . There is an ongoing debate about the question of\u00a0whether a task-relevant item is sometimes completely left out of working memory ( Adam et al . , 2017; Luck and Vogel , 2013; Ma et al . , 2014; Rouder et al . , 2008 ) . Specifically , slot models predict that this happens when set size exceeds the number of slots ( Zhang and Luck , 2008 ) . In resource models , the possibility of complete forgetting has so far been an added ingredient separate from the core of the model ( van den Berg et al . , 2014 ) . Our normative theory allows for a reinterpretation of this question: are there situations in which it is optimal to assign zero resource to the encoding of an item ? We already established that this could happen in delayed-estimation tasks: whenever the probing probability is lower than a threshold value p0=\u03bb| c\u00afbehavioral ( 0 ) | , the optimal amount of resource to invest on encoding the item is zero ( see Theory ) . But what values does p0 take in practice ? Considering the expected behavioral cost function of a fixed-precision model ( a variable-precision model with \u03c4\u21930 ) , we can prove that p0\u00a0=\u00a00 , that\u00a0is , it is never optimal to invest no resource ( Appendix 1 ) . For the expected behavioral cost function of the variable-precision model , however , simulations indicate that p0 can be greater than 0 ( we were not able to derive this result analytically ) . We next examine whether this ever happens under parameter values that are representative for human subjects . Using the maximum-likelihood parameters obtained from the data in E7-E9 , we estimate that p0 ( expressed as a percentage ) equals 8 . 86 \u00b1 0 . 54% . Moreover , we find that for 8 of the 47 subjects , p0 is larger than the lowest probing probability in the experiment , which suggests that these subjects sometimes entirely ignored one or more of the items . For these subjects , the error distributions on items with pi<p0 look uniform ( see Figure 4C for an example ) and Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests for uniformity did not reject the null hypothesis in any of these cases ( p>0 . 05 in all tests ) . These results suggest that there might be a principled reason why people sometimes leave task-relevant items out of visual working memory in delayed-estimation experiments . However , our model cannot explain all previously reported evidence for this . In particular , when probing probabilities are equal for all items , the model makes an \"all or none\"\u00a0prediction: all items are encoded when pi>p0 and none are encoded otherwise . Hence , the\u00a0model cannot explain why subjects in tasks with equal probing probabilities sometimes seem to encode a subset of task-relevant items . For example , a recent study reported that in a whole-report delayed-estimation experiment ( pi\u00a0=\u00a01 for all items ) , subjects encoded about half of the six presented items on each trial ( Adam et al . , 2017 ) . Unless additional assumptions are made , our model cannot account for this finding . The results so far show that the resource-rational model accounts well for data in a variety of delayed-estimation experiments . To examine how its predictions generalize to other tasks , we next consider a change detection task , which is another widely used paradigm in research on VWM . In this task , the observer is sequentially presented with two sets of items and reports if any one of them changed ( Figure 5A ) . In the variant that we consider here , a change is present on exactly half of the trials and is equally likely to occur in any of the items . We construct a model for this task by combining Equations 3 , 4 , and 8 with an expected behavioral cost function based on the Bayesian decision rule for this task ( see Appendix 1 ) , which yields ( 14 ) J\u00afoptimal=argminJ\u00af\u2009[ p ( error|J\u00af ) +\u03bb\u2211i=1N\u2009J\u00afi ] , where p ( error|J\u00af ) is the expected behavioral cost function , which in this case specifies the probability of an error response when a set of items is encoded with resource J\u00af . In contrast to local tasks , the expected total cost in global tasks cannot be written as a sum of expected costs per item , because the expected behavioral cost \u2013 such as p ( error|J\u00af ) in Equation ( 14 ) \u2013 can only be computed globally , not per item . Consequently , the elements of J\u00afoptimal in global tasks cannot be computed separately for each item . This makes resource optimization computationally much more demanding , because it requires solving an N-dimensional minimization problem instead of N one-dimensional problems . We perform a simulation at N\u00a0=\u00a02 ( which is still tractable ) to get an intuition of the predictions that follow from Equation ( 14 ) . For practical convenience , we assume in this simulation that there is no variability in precision , \u03c4\u21930 , such that \u03bb is the only model parameter . The results ( Figure 5B ) show that the cost-minimizing strategy is to encode neither of the items when the amount of reward per correct trial is very low ( left panel ) and encode them both when reward is high ( right panel ) . However , interestingly , there is also an intermediate regime in which the optimal strategy is to encode one of the two items , but not the other one ( Figure 5B , central panel ) . Hence , just as in the delayed-estimation task , there are conditions in which it is optimal to encode only a subset of items . An important difference , however , is that in the delayed-estimation task this only happens when items have unequal probing probabilities , while in this change detection task it even happens when all items are equally likely to change . Simulations at larger set sizes quickly become computationally intractable , because of the reason mentioned above . However , the results at N\u00a0=\u00a02 suggest that if two items are encoded , the optimal solution is to encode them with the same amount of resource ( Figure 5C ) . Therefore , we conjecture that all non-zero values in J\u00afoptimal are identical , which would mean that the entire vector can be summarized by two values: the number of encoded items , which we denote by Koptimal , and the amount of resource assigned to each encoded item , which we denote by J\u00afoptimal . Using this conjecture ( which we have not yet been able to prove ) , we are able to efficiently compute predictions at an arbitrary set size . Simulation results show that the model then predicts that both Koptimal and J\u00afoptimal depend on set size ( Figure 5D , left ) and produces response data that are qualitatively similar to human data ( Figure 5D , right ) . \n Descriptive models of visual working memory ( VWM ) have evolved to a point where there is little room for improvement in how well they account for experimental data . Nevertheless , the basic finding that VWM precision depends on set size still lacks a principled explanation . Here , we examined a normative proposal in which expected task performance is traded off against the cost of spending neural resource on encoding . We used this principle to construct a resource-rational model for \"local\" VWM tasks and found that set size effects in this model are fully mediated by the probing probabilities of the individual items; this is consistent with suggestions from earlier empirical work ( Emrich et al . , 2017; Palmer et al . , 1993 ) . From the perspective of our model , the interpretation is that as more items are added to a task , the relevance of each individual item decreases , which makes it less cost-efficient to spend resource on its encoding . We also found that in this model it is sometimes optimal to encode only a subset of task-relevant items , which implies that resource rationality could serve as a principled bridge between resource and slot-based models of VWM . We tested the model on data from nine previous delayed-estimation experiments and found that it accounts well for effects of both set size and probing probability , despite having relatively few parameters . Moreover , it accounts for a non-monotonicity that appears to exist between set size and the total amount of resource that subjects invest in item encoding . The broader implication of our findings is that VWM limitations \u2013 and cognitive limitations in general \u2013 may be driven by a mechanism that minimizes a cost , instead of by a fixed constraint on available encoding resource . Our theory makes a number of assumptions that need further investigation . First , we have assumed that the expected behavioral cost decreases indefinitely with the amount of invested resource , such that in the limit of infinite resource there is no encoding error and no behavioral cost . However , encoding precision in VWM is fundamentally limited by the precision of the sensory input , which is itself limited by irreducible sources of neural noise \u2013 such as Johnson noise and Poisson shot noise ( Faisal et al . , 2008; Smith , 2015 ) \u2013 and suboptimalities in early sensory processing ( Beck et al . , 2012 ) . One way to incorporate this limitation is by assuming that there is a resource value J\u00afinput beyond which the expected behavioral cost no longer decreases as a function of J\u00af . In this variant , J\u00afinput represents the quality of the input and J\u00afoptimal will never exceed this value , because any additional resource would increase the expected neural cost without decreasing the expected behavioral cost . Moreover , our theory assumes that there is no upper limit on the total amount of resource available for encoding: cost is the only factor that matters . However , as the brain is a finite entity , the total amount of resource must obviously have an upper limit . This limit can be incorporated by optimizing Joptimal under the constraint \u2211i=1N\u2009J\u00afoptimal , i\u2264J\u00afmax , where J\u00afmax represents the maximum amount of resource that can be invested . While an upper limit certainly exists , it may be much higher than the average amount of resource needed to encode information with the same fidelity as the sensory input . If that is the case , then J\u00afinput would be the constraining factor and J\u00afmax would have no effect . Similarly , our theory assumes that there is no lower limit on the amount of resource available for encoding . However , there is evidence that task-irrelevant stimuli are sometimes automatically encoded ( Yi et al . , 2004; Shin and Ma , 2016 ) , perhaps because in natural environments few stimuli are ever completely irrelevant . This would mean that there is a lower limit to the amount of resource spent on encoding . In contradiction to the predictions of our model , such a lower limit would prevent subjects from sometimes encoding nothing at all . For local tasks , such a lower limit can be incorporated by assuming that probing probability pi is never zero . We have fitted our model only to data from delayed-estimation experiments . However , it applies without modification to other local tasks , such as single-probe change detection ( Luck and Vogel , 1997; Todd and Marois , 2004 ) and single-probe change discrimination ( Klyszejko et al . , 2014 ) . Further work is needed to examine how well the model accounts for empirical data of such tasks . Moreover , it should further examine how the theory generalizes to global tasks . One such task could be whole-report change detection; we presented simulation results for this task but the theory remains to be further worked out and fitted to the data . A final limitation is that our theory assumes that items are uniformly distributed and uncorrelated . Although this is correct for most experimental settings , items in more naturalistic settings are often correlated and can take non-uniform distributions . In such environments , the expected total cost can probably be further minimized by taking into account statistical regularities ( Orhan et al . , 2014 ) . Moreover , recent work has suggested that even when items are uncorrelated and uniformly distributed , the expected estimation error can sometimes be reduced by using a \"chunking\" strategy , that\u00a0is , encoding similar items as one ( Nassar et al . , 2018 ) . However , as Nassar et al . assumed a fixed total resource and did not take neural encoding cost into account in their optimization , it remains to be seen whether chunking is also optimal in the kind of model that we proposed . We speculate that this is likely to be the case , because encoding multiple items as one will reduce the expected neural cost ( fewer items to encode ) , while the increase in expected behavioral cost will be negligible if the items are very similar . Hence , it seems worthwhile to examine models that combine resource rationality with chunking . Throughout the paper , we have assumed that there is variability in resource assignment . Part of this variability is possibly a\u00a0result\u00a0of stochastic factors , but part of it may also be systematic \u2013 for example , particular colors and orientations may be encoded with higher precision than others ( Bae et al . , 2014; Girshick et al . , 2011 ) . Whereas the systematic component could have a rational basis ( e . g . higher precision for colors and orientations that occur more frequently in natural scenes [Ganguli and Simoncelli , 2010; Wei and Stocker , 2015] ) , this is unlikely to be true for the random component . Indeed , when we jointly optimize J\u00afand \u03c4 in Equation 11 , we find estimates of \u03c4 that consistently approach 0 , meaning that any variability in encoding precision is suboptimal under our proposed cost function . One way to reconcile this apparent suboptimality with the otherwise normative theory is to postulate that maintaining exactly equal resource assignment across cortical regions may itself be a costly process; under such a cost , it could be optimal to allow for some variability in resource assignment . Another possibility is that there are unavoidable imperfections in mental inference ( Drugowitsch et al . , 2016 ) that make it impossible to compute J\u00afoptimal without error , such that the outcome of the computation will vary from trial to trial even when the stimuli are identical . In the present study , we have focused on effects of set size and probing probability on encoding precision . However , our theory also makes predictions about effects of incentive manipulations on encoding precision , because such manipulations affect the expected behavioral cost function . Incentives can be experimentally manipulated in a variety of ways . One method used in at least two previously published delayed-estimation experiments is to make the feedback binary ( \"correct , \" \"error\" ) and vary the value of the maximum error allowed to receive positive feedback ( Zhang and Luck , 2011; Nassar et al . , 2018 ) . In both studies , subjects in a \"low precision\" condition received positive feedback whenever their estimation error was smaller than a threshold value of \u03c0/3 . Subjects in the \"high precision\" condition , however , received positive feedback only when the error was smaller than \u03c0/12 ( Zhang and Luck , 2011 ) or \u03c0/8 ( Nassar et al . , 2018 ) . Neither of the two studies found evidence for a difference in encoding precision between the low- and high-precision conditions . At first , this may seem to be at odds with the predictions of our model , as one may expect that it should assign more resource to items in the high-precision condition . To test whether this is the case , we simulated this experimental manipulation using a behavioral cost function cbehavioral , i ( \u03b5 ) that maps values of |\u03b5| smaller than the feedback threshold to 0 and larger values to 1 . The results reveal that the model predictions are not straightforward and that it can actually account for the absence of an effect ( Figure 6 ) . In particular , the simulation results suggest that the experimental manipulations in the studies by Zhang and Luck and Nassar et al . may not have been strong enough to measure an effect . Indeed , another study has criticized the study by Zhang and Luck on exactly this point and did find an effect when using an experimental design with stronger incentives ( Fougnie et al . , 2016 ) . Another method to manipulate incentives is to vary the amount of potential reward across items within a display . For example , Klyszejko and colleagues performed a local change discrimination experiment in which the monetary reward for a correct response depended on which item was probed ( Klyszejko et al . , 2014 ) . They found a positive relation between the amount of reward associated with an item and response accuracy , which indicates that subjects spent more resource on encoding items with larger potential reward . This incentive manipulation can be implemented by multiplying the behavioral cost function with an item-dependent factor ui , which modifies Equation ( 11 ) to J\u00afoptimal , i ( ri;\u03bb , \u03c4 ) =argminJ\u00af ( uipic\u00afbehavioral ( J\u00af;\u03c4 ) +\u03bbJ\u00af ) . The coefficients ui and pi can be combined into a single \"item relevance\" coefficient ri\u00a0=\u00a0uipi , and all theoretical results and predictions that we derived for pi now apply to ri . A difference between the two discussed methods is that the former varied incentives within a trial and the latter across trials . However , both methods can be applied in both ways . A within-trial variant of the experiments by Zhang and Luck ( 2011 ) and Nassar et al . ( 2018 ) would be a N\u00a0=\u00a02 task in which one of the items always has a low positive feedback threshold and the other a high one . Similarly , a between-trial variant of the experiment by Klyszejko et al . ( 2014 ) would be to scale the behavioral cost function of items with a factor that varies across trials or blocks , but is constant within a trial . Our model can be used to derive predictions for these task variants , which to our knowledge have not been previously\u00a0reported in the published literature . Our results raise the question of\u00a0what neural mechanism could implement the optimal allocation policy that forms the core of our theory . Some form of divisive normalization ( Bays , 2014; Carandini and Heeger , 2012 ) would be a likely candidate , which is already a key operation in neural models of attention ( Reynolds and Heeger , 2009 ) and visual working memory ( Bays , 2014; Wei et al . , 2012 ) . The essence of this mechanism is that it lowers the gain when set size is larger , without requiring explicit knowledge of the set size prior to the presentation of the stimuli . Consistent with the predictions of this theory , empirical work has found that the neural activity associated with the encoding of an item decreases with set size , as observed in for example the lateral intraparietal cortex ( Churchland et al . , 2008; Balan et al . , 2008 ) and superior colliculus ( Basso and Wurtz , 1998 ) . Moreover , the work by Bays ( 2014 ) has shown that a modified version of divisive normalization can account for the near-optimal distribution of resources across items with unequal probing probabilities . As set size effects in our model are mediated by probing probability , its predicted set size effects can probably be accounted for by a similar mechanism . Another question concerns the timescale at which the optimization takes place . In all experimental data that we considered here , the only factors that changed from trial to trial were set size ( E1-E7 ) and probing probability ( E7-E9 ) . When we fitted the model , we assumed that the expected total cost in these experiments was minimized on a trial-by-trial basis: whenever set size or probing probability changed from one trial to the next , the computation of Joptimal followed this change . This assumption accounted well for the data and , as discussed above , previous work has shown that divisive normalization can accommodate trial-by-trial changes in set size and probing probability . However , can the same mechanism also accommodate changes in the optimal resource policy changes driven by other factors , such as the behavioral cost function , cbehavioral ( \u03b5 ) ? From a computational standpoint , divisive normalization is a mapping from an input vector of neural activities to an output vector , and the shape of this mapping depends on the parameters of the mechanism ( such as gain , weighting factors , and a power on the input ) . As the mapping is quite flexible , we expect that it can accommodate a near-optimal allocation policy for most experimental conditions . However , top-down control and some form of learning ( e . g . reinforcement learning ) are likely required to adjust the parameters of the normalization mechanism , which would prohibit instantaneous optimality after a change in the experimental conditions . The total amount of resource that subjects spend on item encoding may vary non-monotonically with set size in our model . At the neural level , this translates to a prediction of a non-monotonic relation between population-level spiking activity and set size . We are not aware of any studies that have specifically addressed this prediction , but it can be tested using neuroimaging experiments similar to previously conducted experiments . For example , Balan et al . used single-neuron recording to estimate neural activity per item for set sizes 2 , 4 , and 6 in a visual search task ( Balan et al . , 2008 ) . To test for the existence of the predicted non-monotonicity , the same recoding techniques can be used in a VWM task with a more fine-grained range of set sizes . Even though it is practically impossible to directly measure population-level activity , reasonable estimates may be obtained by multiplying single-neuron recordings with set size ( under the assumption that an increase in resource translates to an increase in firing rate and not an increase of neurons used to encode an item ) . A similar method can also assess the relation between an item\u2019s probing probability and the spiking activity related to its neural encoding . Our theory might apply beyond working memory tasks . In particular , it has been speculated that the selectivity of attention arises from a need to balance performance against the costs associated with spiking ( Pestilli and Carrasco , 2005; Lennie , 2003 ) . Our theory provides a normative formalism to test this speculation and may thus explain set size effects in attention tasks ( Lindsay et al . , 1968; Shaw , 1980; Ma and Huang , 2009 ) . Furthermore , developmental studies have found that that working memory capacity estimates change with age ( Simmering and Perone , 2012; Simmering , 2012 ) . Viewed from the perspective of our proposed theory , this raises the question\u00a0of why the optimal trade-off between behavioral and neural cost would change with age . A speculative answer is that a subject's coding efficiency \u2013 formalized by the reciprocal of parameter \u03b1 in Equation 7 \u2013 may improve during childhood: an increase in coding efficiency reduces the neural cost per unit of precision , which shifts the optimal amount of resource to use for encoding to larger values . Neuroimaging studies might provide insight into whether and how coding efficiency changes with age , for\u00a0example by estimating the amount of neural activity required per unit of precision in memory representations . Our work fits into a broader tradition of normative theories in psychology and neuroscience ( Table 4 ) . The main motivation for such theories is to reach a deeper level of understanding by analyzing a system in the context of the ecological needs and constraints under which it evolved . Besides work on ideal-observer decision rules ( Green and Swets , 1966; KordingK\u00f6rding , 2007; Geisler , 2011; Shen and Ma , 2016 ) and on resource-limited approximations to optimal inference ( Gershman et al . , 2015; Griffiths et al . , 2015; Vul and Pashler , 2008; Vul , 2009 ) , normative approaches have also been used at the level of neural coding . For example , properties of receptive fields ( Vincent et al . , 2005; Liu et al . , 2009; Olshausen and Field , 1996 ) , tuning curves ( Attneave , 1954; Barlow , 1961; Ganguli and Simoncelli , 2010 ) , neural architecture ( Cherniak , 1994; Chklovskii et al . , 2002 ) , receptor performance ( Laughlin , 2001 ) , and neural network modularity ( Clune et al . , 2013 ) have been explained as outcomes of optimization under either a cost or a hard constraint ( on total neural firing , sparsity , or wiring length ) , and are thus mathematically closely related to the theory presented here . However , a difference concerns the timescale at which the optimization takes place: while optimization in the context of neural coding is typically thought to take place at the timescale over which the statistics of the environment change or a developmental timescale , the theory that we presented here could optimize on a trial-by-trial basis to follow changes in task properties . We already mentioned the information-theory models of working memory developed by Chris R . Sims et al . A very similar framework has been proposed by Chris A . Sims in behavioral economics , who used information theory to formalize his hypothesis of \"rational inattention , \" that\u00a0is , the hypothesis that consumers make optimal decisions under a fixed budget of attentional resources that can be allocated to process economic data ( Sims , 2003 ) . The model presented here differs from these two approaches in two important ways . First , similar to early models of visual working memory limitations , they postulate a fixed total amount of resources ( formalized as channel capacity ) , which is a constraint rather than a cost . Second , even if it had been a cost , it would have been the expected value of a log probability ratio . Unlike neural spike count , a log probability ratio does not obviously map to a biologically meaningful cost on a single-trial level . Nevertheless , recent work has attempted to bridge rational inattention and attention in a psychophysical setting ( Caplin et al . , 2018 ) . \n Data from experiments E1-E7 ( Table 1 ) and Matlab code for model fitting and simulations are available at http://dx . doi . org/10 . 5061/dryad . nf5dr6c . Bayesian t-tests were performed using the JASP software package ( JASP Team , 2017 ) with the scale parameter of the Cauchy prior set to its default value of 0 . 707 . We used a Bayesian optimization method ( Acerbi and Ma , 2017 ) to find the parameter vector \u03b8={ \u03b2 , \u03bb , \u03c4 } that maximizes the log likelihood function , \u2211i=1n\u2009logp ( \u03b5i;pi , \u03b8 ) , where n is the number of trials in the subject\u2019s data set , \u03b5i the estimation error on the ith trial , and pi the probing probability of the probed item on that trial . To reduce the risk of converging into a local maximum , initial parameter estimates were chosen based on a coarse grid search over a large range of parameter values . The predicted estimation error distribution for a given parameter vector \u03b8 and probing probability pi was computed as follows . First , J\u00afoptimal was computed by applying Matlab's fminsearch function to Equation 11 . Thereafter , the gamma distribution over J ( with mean J\u00afoptimal and shape parameter \u03c4 ) was discretized into 50 equal-probability bins . The predicted ( Von Mises ) estimation error distribution was then computed under the central value of each bin . Finally , these 50 predicted distributions were averaged . We verified that increasing the number of bins used in the numerical approximation of the integral over J did not substantially affect the results . In the cross-validation analysis , we fitted the models in the same way as described above , but using only 80% of the data . We did this five times , each time leaving out a different subset of 20%\u00a0of\u00a0the data ( in the first run we left out trials 1 , 6 , 11; in the second run we left out trials 2 , 7 , 12 , etc . ) . At the end of each run , we used the maximum-likelihood parameter estimates to compute the log likelihood of the 20% of trials that were left out . These log likelihood values were then combined across the five runs to give an overall cross-validated log likelihood value for each model .", "headings": ["Abstract", "Results", "Discussion", "Materials and methods"], "keywords": ["neuroscience"], "id": "elife-34963-v2"}
{"lay_summary": "Plants and other living organisms can survive stress and starvation by digesting and recycling parts of their own cells . This process is known as autophagy and it involves engulfing cellular material inside spherical structures called autophagosomes , before delivering it to sites in the cell where digestive enzymes can break the material down . A form of autophagy , known as selective autophagy , can specifically degrade toxic substances such as disease-causing microbes . Selective autophagy works through proteins called autophagy cargo receptors that define which molecules are targeted for degradation . However , it was not clear whether autophagy protects plants from infections , or how much disease-causing microbes interfere with this process for their own benefit . The microbe that causes late blight of potatoes ( called Phytophthora infestans ) is infamous for triggering widespread famines in Ireland in the 19th century . This disease-causing microbe continues to pose a serious threat to food security today , and parasitizes plant tissues by releasing proteins called effectors that enter the plant\u2019s cells to subvert the plant\u2019s physiology and counteract its defenses . Dagdas , Belhaj et al . now report that an effector from P . infestans , called PexRD54 , can bind to autophagy-related protein from potato , called ATG8CL , and stimulate the formation of autophagosomes . Further experiments revealed that the PexRD54 effector could outcompete a plant autophagy cargo receptor that would otherwise bind to ATG8CL . This plant cargo receptor contributes to the plant\u2019s defences , and by preventing it from interacting with ATG8CL , PexRD54 makes the plant more susceptible to infection by P . infestans . These findings show that the PexRD54 effector has evolved to interact with an autophagy-related protein to counteract the plant\u2019s defences . Dagdas , Belhaj et al . suggest that PexRD54 might do this by activating autophagy to selectively eliminate some of the molecules that the plant use to defend itself . Furthermore , P . infestans might also benefit from the nutrients that are released when cellular material is broken down via autophagy . Future work could test these two hypotheses and explore whether other effectors from disease-causing microbes work in a similar way .", "article": "Plants use autophagy to safeguard against infectious diseases . However , how plant pathogens interfere with autophagy-related processes is unknown . Here , we show that PexRD54 , an effector from the Irish potato famine pathogen Phytophthora infestans , binds host autophagy protein ATG8CL to stimulate autophagosome formation . PexRD54 depletes the autophagy cargo receptor Joka2 out of ATG8CL complexes and interferes with Joka2's positive effect on pathogen defense . Thus , a plant pathogen effector has evolved to antagonize a host autophagy cargo receptor to counteract host defenses . \n Autophagy is conserved catabolic pathway that sequesters unwanted cytosolic components into newly formed double membrane vesicles , autophagosomes , to direct them to the cell\u2019s lytic compartment ( He and Klionsky , 2009 ) . The process plays a vital role in survival of the organism by improving cellular adaptation to environmental and stress conditions ( Shintani and Klionsky , 2004 ) . Autophagy provides building blocks and energy for elementary cellular processes by degrading dysfunctional or unnecessary cellular components during nutrient deprivation ( Shintani and Klionsky , 2004 ) . However , even though autophagy was initially thought to be a bulk degradation process activated during starvation , recent studies showed that it can act selectively , capturing specific substrates through specialized cargo receptors to respond to a variety of environmental and stress conditions ( Stolz et al . , 2014 ) . Autophagy is executed through coordinated action of more than 30 core proteins known as the ATG ( autophagy-related ) proteins ( Lamb et al . , 2013 ) . Selective autophagy is regulated through specific interactions of autophagy cargo receptors and ATG8 proteins ( Stolz et al . , 2014 ) . Autophagy cargo receptors carry a short sequence motif called ATG8-interaction motif ( AIM ) that binds lipidated ATG8 proteins anchored on autophagosomal membranes . Cargo receptors mediate recognition of a diverse set of cargo ( Stolz et al . , 2014 ) . For instance , mammalian autophagy cargo receptors NDP52 and optineurin can recognize intracellular pathogenic bacteria and mediate their autophagic removal by sorting the captured bacteria inside the ATG8-coated autophagosomes ( Boyle and Randow , 2013 ) . Nevertheless , the precise molecular mechanisms of selective autophagy and the components that regulate it remain unknown ( Huang and Brumell , 2014; Mostowy , 2013; Randow , 2011 ) . In plants , autophagy plays important roles in stress tolerance , senescence , development , and defense against invading pathogens ( Patel and Dinesh-Kumar , 2008; Lenz et al . , 2011; Vanhee and Batoko , 2011; Li and Vierstra , 2012; Lv et al . , 2014; Teh and Hofius , 2014 ) . Specifically , autophagy is implicated in the\u00a0accumulation of defense hormones and the hypersensitive response , a form of plant cell death that prevents spread of microbial infection ( Yoshimoto et al . , 2009 ) . However , the molecular mechanisms that mediate defense-related autophagy and the selective nature of this process are poorly understood . Furthermore , how adapted plant pathogens manipulate defense-related autophagy and/or subvert autophagy for nutrient uptake is unknown . In this study , we investigated how a pathogen interferes with and coopts a plant autophagy pathway . The potato blight pathogen , Phytophthora infestans , is a serious threat to food security , causing crop losses that , if alleviated , could feed hundreds of millions of people ( Fisher et al . , 2012 ) . This pathogen delivers RXLR-type effector proteins inside plant cells to enable parasitism ( Morgan and Kamoun , 2007 ) . RXLR effectors form a diverse family of modular proteins that alter a variety of host processes and therefore serve as useful probes to dissect key pathways for pathogen invasion ( Morgan and Kamoun , 2007; Bozkurt et al . , 2012 ) . Here , we show that the RXLR effector PexRD54 has evolved to bind host autophagy protein ATG8CL to stimulate autophagosome formation . In addition , PexRD54 depletes the autophagy cargo receptor Joka2 out of ATG8CL complexes to counteract host defenses against P . infestans . \n As part of an in plantascreen for host interactors of RXLR effectors , we discovered that the P . infestans effector PexRD54 associates with ATG8CL , a member of the ATG8 family ( Materials and methods , Supplementary files 1 , 2 ) . The association between PexRD54 and ATG8CL was retained under stringent binding conditions in contrast to other candidate interactors ( Supplementary file 1 ) . We validated the association with reverse coimmunoprecipitation after co-expressing the potato ATG8CL protein with the C-terminal effector domain of PexRD54 in planta ( Figure 1A , B ) . In addition , PexRD54 expressed and purified from Escherichia coli directly bound ATG8CL in vitro with high affinity and in a one to one ratio ( KD = 383 nM based on isothermal titration calorimetry ) ( Figure 1C ) . PexRD54 has two predicted ATG8 Interacting Motifs ( AIMs ) that match the consensus amino acid sequence W/F/Y-x-x-L/I/V ( AIM1 and AIM2 , Figure 1A ) . In planta coimmunoprecipitations of single and double AIM mutants of PexRD54 revealed that AIM2 , which spans the last four amino acids of the protein ( positions 378\u2013381 ) , is required for association with ATG8CL ( Figure 1D ) . PexRD54AIM2 mutant also failed to bind ATG8CL in vitro ( Figure 1E ) . In addition , ATG8CL bound with high affinity to a synthetic peptide ( KPLDFDWEIV ) that matches the last 10 C-terminal amino acids of PexRD54 ( KD = 220\u00a0nM ) ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . We conclude that the C-terminal AIM of PexRD54 is necessary and sufficient to bind ATG8CL . 10 . 7554/eLife . 10856 . 003Figure 1 .

N-terminal fusions of PexRD54 to the green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) or red fluorescent protein ( RFP ) labelled the nucleo-cytoplasm and mobile punctate structures ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1 and Video 1 ) . Immunogold labelling in transmission electron micrographs of cells expressing GFP:PexRD54 revealed a strong signal in electron dense structures that are not peroxisomes ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplements 2\u20133 , Dagdas et al . , 2016 ) . To determine whether these structures are ATG8CL autophagosomes , we transiently co-expressed RFP:PexRD54 with GFP:ATG8CL in plant cells and observed an overlap between the two fluorescent signals in sharp contrast to RFP:PexRD54AIM2 and RFP:EV negative controls ( Figure 3 and Video 2 ) . This indicates that PexRD54 localizes to ATG8CL-marked autophagosomes and its C-terminal AIM is necessary for autophagosome localization . In contrast , RFP:PexRD54 signal overlapped with GFP:ATG8IL-labelled autophagosomes in only 15\u201320% of observations consistent with its weaker binding affinity to ATG8IL ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 4 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 10856 . 008Video 1 .

ATG8CL terminal glycine deletion mutant prevents formation of PexRD54 labelled puncta in a dominant negative manner . ( A ) A glycine to alanine mutation in the conserved terminal glycine residue of GFP:ATG8CL does not prevent binding to RFP:PexRD54 .

GFP:ATG8CL showed distinct punctate structures , whereas GFP:ATG8CL\u0394 was mainly cytosolic with few visible puncta . When RFP:PexRD54 was co-expressed with GFP:ATG8CL\u0394 , the punctate localization was lost consistent with the recruitment of PexRD54 to ATG8CL labelled autophagosomes .

RFP:PexRD54 was transiently co-expressed with GFP:ATG8CL in N . benthamiana leaves and examined by confocal laser scanning microscopy , 3 days post infiltration . ( Related to Figure 3 ) DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 10856 . 017 To further confirm that PexRD54-labelled endomembrane compartments are indeed autophagosomes , we investigated the effect of the autophagy inhibitor 3-methyl adenine ( 3-MA ) ( Hanamata et al . , 2013 ) on PexRD54 localization . Compared to water , 3-MA treatment reduced the number of PexRD54 and ATG8CL puncta but did not reduce the number of puncta of the trans-Golgi network ( TGN ) marker VTI12 ( Geldner et al . , 2009 ) ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 5 ) . Phospholipid modification of a conserved glycine residue at the C-terminus of ATG8 proteins is required for autophagosome formation , and deletion of this terminal glycine yields a dominant negative ATG8 ( Hanamata et al . , 2013 ) . We deployed a terminal glycine deletion mutant of ATG8CL ( ATG8CL\u0394 ) to determine its effect on subcellular distribution of PexRD54 ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 6 ) . As expected , deletion of the terminal glycine did not affect binding of ATG8CL to PexRD54 ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 7A ) . However , GFP:ATG8CL\u0394 led to the\u00a0depletion of RFP:PexRD54 labelled puncta presumably because the dominant negative effect of ATG8CL\u0394 prevented accumulation of RFP:PexRD54 in ATG8CL-labelled autophagosomes ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 7B\u2013D ) . In contrast , GFP:ATG8IL\u0394 , a terminal glycine deletion mutant of ATG8IL , had no effect on the punctate localization of RFP:PexRD54 ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 7C\u2013D ) . These experiments independently support the finding that PexRD54 accumulates in ATG8CL autophagosomes . Increase in ATG8 labelled puncta is widely used as a functional readout of autophagic activity ( Hanamata et al . , 2013; Bassham , 2015 ) . In samples expressing PexRD54 , we noticed a ~fivefold increase in the number of ATG8CL marked autophagosomes compared to control samples expressing PexRD54AIM2 or empty vector control ( Figure 4 , Video 3 ) . In contrast , PexRD54 did not alter the number of ATG8IL autophagosomes consistent with the weak binding noted between these two proteins ( Figure 4A ) . This indicates that PexRD54 stimulates the formation of ATG8CL autophagosomes . 10 . 7554/eLife . 10856 . 018Figure 4 . PexRD54 increases the number of ATG8CL autophagosomes . ( A ) Co-expression of RFP:PexRD54 , but not RFP:PexRD54AIM2 or RFP:EV significantly enhanced the number of GFP:ATG8CL-labelled autophagosomes in N . benthamiana . Bar charts display the number of GFP:ATG8CL or GFP:ATG8IL-labelled autophagosomes in the presence of RFP:PexRD54 , RFP:PexRD54AIM2 or RFP:EV . GFP:ATG8CL autophagosomes were significantly enhanced by the\u00a0expression of RFP:PexRD54 ( ***p<0 . 001 ) . GFP:ATG8IL autophagosomes were not significantly enhanced by expression of RFP:PexRD54 ( ns=statistically not significant ) . The\u00a0data are representative of 500 individual images from two biological replicates . Each replicate consists of five independent Z stacks with 50 images each , acquired from five independent leaf areas .

( Related to Figure 4 ) DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 10856 . 019 Next , we set out to determine the effect of PexRD54 on autophagic flux . Treatment of RFP:ATG8CL expressing leaves with the specific vacuolar ATPase inhibitor concanamycin-A ( Bassham , 2015 ) increased the number of ATG8CL-labelled puncta both in the presence of PexRD54 or controls ( PexRD54AIM2 or vector control ) indicating that PexRD54 does not block autophagic flux ( Figure 5A\u2013B ) . We also confirmed these observations using western blot analyses . PexRD54 , but neither PexRD54AIM2 or vector control , increased the\u00a0levels of GFP:ATG8CL protein 3 days after co-expression in planta ( Figure 5C ) . Treatment of three-day samples with E64d , an inhibitor of vacuolar cysteine proteases ( Bassham , 2015 ) , further increased protein levels of GFP:ATG8CL . This further confirms that PexRD54 stimulates autophagy rather than blocking autophagic flux ( Figure 5C ) . PexRD54 did not alter the accumulation of GFP:ATG8IL or control GFP protein , confirming that PexRD54 increases ATG8CL protein accumulation specifically ( Figure 5C ) . Consistent with these observations , we noted an increase in GFP:ATG8CL levels , but not in control GFP , during P . infestans infection relative to the mock infection ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 10856 . 020Figure 5 . PexRD54 does not block autophagic flux . ( A\u2013B ) ConcanamycinA treatment increases the number of autophagosomes in PexRD54 expressing samples . RFP:ATG8CL was transienly coexpressed with PexRD54 , PexRD54AIM2 and empty vector controls in N . benthamiana . Two days after infiltration , leaves were treated with concanamycinA ( conA ) or infiltration buffer and number of autophagosomes was counted 24\u2009hr after treatment . ConA treatment significantly increased the number of autophagosomes in PexRD54 expressing cells ( p<0 . 05 ) , confirming PexRD54 does not block autophagic flux . Scale bar=10\u00a0\u03bcm . ( C ) E64D treatment increases ATG8CL protein levels in PexRD54 expressing samples . GFP:ATG8CL , GFP:ATG8IL and GFP:EV were transiently coexpressed with RFP:GUS , RFP:PexRD54 or RFP:PexRD54AIM2 in N . benthamiana leaves and protein levels in total extracts were determined two and 3 days post infiltration ( dpi ) . RFP:PexRD54 increased protein levels of GFP:ATG8CL but not GFP:ATG8IL consistent with stronger binding affinity of PexRD54 to ATG8CL . RFP:PexRD54 did not increase protein levels of GFP:EV , suggesting that protein level increase depends on ATG8CL binding and that PexRD54 does not increase protein levels in general . The\u00a0samples were also treated with E64d to measure autophagic flux . In RFP:PexRD54 coexpressed 3 dpi samples , E64d treatment increased ATG8CL protein levels even more suggesting PexRD54 does not block autophagic flux . Hence , protein level increase is a result of stimulation of autophagy . The\u00a0blots were stained with Ponceau stain ( PS ) to show equal loading .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 10856 . 021 The presence of a functional AIM in PexRD54 prompted us to hypothesize that this effector perturbs the autophagy cargo receptors of its host plants . Recently , Joka2 was reported as a selective autophagy cargo receptor of Solanaceous plants that also binds ATG8 via an AIM ( Svenning et al . , 2011; Zientara-Rytter et al . , 2011 ) ( Figure 6A ) . Indeed , in planta coimmunoprecipitation assays confirmed that potato Joka2 , but not the AIM mutant , Joka2AIM , associated with ATG8CL ( Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . Joka2 association with ATG8CL was somewhat specific given that this cargo receptor failed to coimmunoprecipitate with ATG8IL ( Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . Joka2 , but not Joka2AIM , also markedly increased the number of GFP:ATG8CL autophagosomes ( Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3 , Video 4 ) , and enhanced ATG8CL protein levels ( Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 4 ) . This indicates that Joka2 also activates ATG8CL-mediated selective autophagy . 10 . 7554/eLife . 10856 . 022Figure 6 .

( Related to Figure 6 ) DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 10856 . 029 Given that both PexRD54 and Joka2 bind ATG8CL via their respective AIMs , we hypothesized that PexRD54 interferes with the Joka2-ATG8CL complex . We tested our hypothesis by performing coimmunoprecipitation experiments between Joka2:RFP and GFP:ATG8CL in the presence or absence of PexRD54 . Remarkably , ATG8CL complexes were depleted in Joka2 in the presence of PexRD54 relative to the PexRD54AIM2 and vector control ( Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 5 ) . Consistently , Joka2 binding to ATG8CL decreased with increasing PexRD54 concentrations ( Figure 6B ) . The distinct AIMs of PexRD54 and Joka2 presumably determine the effect observed in these competition experiments . To further test this , we replaced the functional PexRD54 AIM with two sequences that cover the Joka2 AIM:GVAEWDPI ( PexRD54J2AIM1 ) and GVAEWDPILEELKEMG ( PexRD54J2AIM2 ) ( Figure 6C ) . Both PexRD54J2AIM1 and PexRD54J2AIM2 associated with ATG8CL to a lesser extent than wild-type PexRD54 ( Figure 6D ) , and were less effective than PexRD54 in depleting Joka2 out of ATG8CL complexes ( Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 6 ) . These findings reveal that PexRD54 antagonizes Joka2 for ATG8CL binding . Finally , we investigated the degree to which activation of Joka2-ATG8CL-mediated autophagy contributes to pathogen defense . Overexpression of Joka2 , but not Joka2AIM , significantly restricted the size of the disease lesions caused by P . infestans ( Figure 7A\u2013B ) . Conversely , virus-induced gene silencing of Joka2 resulted in increased disease lesions ( Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . This indicates that Joka2-mediated selective autophagy contributes to defense against this pathogen . Remarkably , PexRD54 counteracted the enhanced resistance conferred by Joka2 whereas PexRD54AIM2 failed to reverse this effect ( Figure 7C\u2013D ) . We conclude that PexRD54 counteracts the positive role of Joka2-mediated selective autophagy in pathogen defense . 10 . 7554/eLife . 10856 . 030Figure 7 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 10856 . 031 As demonstrated in mammalian systems , eukaryotic cells employ autophagy to defend against invading pathogens ( Boyle and Randow , 2013; Randow and Youle , 2014 ) . In turn , pathogens can deploy effectors to avoid autophagy and enable parasitic infection ( Baxt et al . , 2013 ) . For instance , to counteract antimicrobial autophagy , intracellular bacterial pathogen Legionella pneumophila secretes a type IV effector protein RavZ that impedes autophagy by uncoupling ATG8-lipid linkage ( Choy et al . , 2012 ) . In this study , we show that a plant pathogen effector has evolved an ATG8 interacting motif to bind with high affinity to the autophagy protein ATG8CL and stimulate the formation of ATG8CL-marked autophagosomes . Unlike the Legionella effector RavZ , PexRD54 activates selective autophagy possibly to eliminate defense-related compounds or to reattribute cellular resources by promoting nutrient recycling . Our results show that , in addition to disrupting , pathogens can also activate autophagy for their own benefit ( Figure 8 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 10856 . 032Figure 8 . PexRD54 outcompetes the autophagy cargo receptor Joka2 and enhances virulence . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 10856 . 032 Additionally , we show that the effector competes with the host cargo receptor Joka2 and depletes it out of ATG8CL autophagosomes to promote disease susceptibility . Thus P . infestans coopts the host cell\u2019s endomembrane compartment to promote its own growth at the cost of the cell\u2019s physiology ( Bozkurt et al . , 2015 ) . Joka2 could contribute to immunity by inducing autophagic removal of plant or pathogen molecules that negatively affect host defenses . It will be interesting in the future to determine the identity of potential defense-related cargo carried by Joka2 ( Figure 8 ) . The physiological roles of selective autophagy and the molecular mechanisms involved remain to be determined both in plants and animals . Characterization of additional host cargo receptors and interactome analysis of particular ATG8 proteins should improve our understanding of how selective autophagy operates in response to a variety of stress conditions including immunity . In the potato genome , we identified nine ATG8 genes . Both Joka2 and the effector showed higher affinity to ATG8CL compared to ATG8IL ( Figure 2 and Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . This indicates that variation between plant ATG8 proteins may contribute to the selective nature of autophagy . This work further highlights the intricate changes in endomembrane compartment formation that take place during plant-microbe interactions ( Bozkurt et al . , 2015; Lipka and Panstruga , 2005; Kwon et al . , 2008; Ivanov et al . , 2010; Wang et al . , 2010 ) . Future studies will need to consider pathogen-directed modulation of the spatio-temporal dynamics of autophagy and subcellular trafficking during host infection . It will be interesting to determine whether other plant pathogens also secrete effectors that evolved an ATG8 interacting motif or target autophagy in other ways . These effectors would serve as valuable tools to dissect the mechanisms of defense-related selective autophagy . \n ATG8 interacting motif ( AIM ) , also known as LC3 interacting region ( LIR ) , mediates interaction of cargo receptors or adaptors with ATG8 proteins anchored in autophagosome membranes ( Birgisdottir et al . , 2013 ) . It follows the W/F/Y-xx-L/I/V amino acid consensus . Initially , we identified two AIM candidates in PexRD54 , AIM1 and AIM2 based on the manual search of the consensus sequence mentioned earlier . Then , we confirmed these AIM candidates using the recently published iLIR software ( Kalvari et al . , 2014 ) . This software assigned AIM1 with an iLIR score of 12 ( 1 . 1e-1 ) and AIM2 with an iLIR score of 23 ( 3 . 2e-3 ) . To determine the ATG8 variant ( s ) specifically targeted by PexRD54 among various host ATG8 family members , we performed a BLASTP search ( Altschul et al . , 1990 ) against solanaceous plant proteomes including Solanum tuberosum ( potato ) , Solanum lycopersicum ( tomato ) and Nicotiana benthamiana using Arabidopsis thaliana ATG8C as the query protein sequence . We found nine ATG8 members in S . tuberosum , seven in S . lycopersicum , and eight in N . benthamiana . To verify the gene calls and open reading frame predictions of the putative orthologs in these three species , we performed a sequence alignment of the family members in each species using the Clustal X program ( v2 ) ( Larkin et al . , 2007 ) and compared it to the published A . thaliana ATG8 sequences . We found evidence of misannotation for two S . lycopersicum sequences ( Solyc10g006270 and Solyc08g078820 ) and three others in N . benthamiana ( NbS00015425g0005 , NbS00003316g0005 and NbS00003005g0010 ) . The two S . lycopersium sequences and the NbS00003005g0010 sequence from N . benthamiana carried extra nucleotides before the likely start codon , which were corrected accordingly . A TBLASTN search against the N . benthamiana scaffolds followed by a BLASTP search of the different exons allowed curation of the two other sequences . Clustal X program was used for multiple sequence alignment of ATG8 variants . Boxshade server ( http://embnet . vital-it . ch/software/BOX_form . html ) was used to visualize the sequence alignment . The phylogenetic tree of ATG8 homologs in plants was constructed with the neighbor-joining method using ATG8-like curated proteins from S . tuberosum , S . lycopersium , N . benthamina , and A . thaliana . The phylogenetic tree was constructed using MEGA5 ( Kumar et al . , 2001 ) with bootstrap values based on 1000 iterations . ATG8CL variants in N . benthamiana and potato have identical amino acid sequences . All primers used in this study are listed in Supplementary file 3 . PexRD54 and Joka2 were amplified using polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) from genomic DNA of Phytophthora infestans isolate T30-4 and Solanum tuberosum cv . D\u00e9sir\u00e9e cDNA , respectively . To amplify both amplicons , we used Phusion proof reading polymerase ( New England Biolabs , UK ) and primer pairs listed in Supplementary file 3 . All amplicons were subsequently cloned into the pENTR/D-Topo Gateway entry vector ( Invitrogen , UK ) . The ATG8CL , ATG8CL\u0394 , ATG8IL , and ATG8IL\u0394 entry clones were custom synthesized into pUC57-AmpR using the sequences matching S . tuberosum ATG8CL or ATG8IL genes flanked by attL1 and attL2 gateway sites ( Genewiz , UK ) . The destination constructs GFP:PexRD54 , RFP:PexRD54 , Joka2:RFP , Joka2:GFP , RFP:ATG8CL , GFP:ATG8CL , GFP:ATG8CL\u0394 , GFP:ATG8IL\u0394 , HA:PexRD54 were generated by Gateway LR recombination reaction ( Invitrogen ) of the corresponding entry clone and Gateway destination vectors pH7WGR2 ( N-terminal RFP fusion ) , pK7WGF2 ( N-terminal GFP fusion ) , pB7FWR2 ( C-terminal GFP fusion ) , pB7RWG2 ( C-terminal RFP fusion ) and pK7WGF2 ( N-terminal HA fusion , generated in house by replacement of GFP with an HA tag ) , respectively ( Karimi et al . , 2002 ) . The GFP:PexRD54AIM2 , RFP:PexRD54AIM1 , RFP:PexRD54AIM2 , RFP:PexRD54AIM1+2 RFP:PexRD54KPLDFDWEIV , RFP:PexRD54J2AIM1 , RFP:PexRD54J2AIM2 , HA:PexRD54AIM2 , HA:PexRD54AIM2 , HA:PexRD54J2AIM1 , HA:PexRD54J2AIM2 , Joka2AIM:RFP constructs were generated as follows:PexRD54 and Joka2 mutant constructs ( PexRD54AIM1 , PexRD54AIM2 , PexRD54AIM1+2 , PexRD54KPLDFDWEIV , RFP:PexRD54J2AIM1 , RFP:PexRD54J2AIM2 , and Joka2AIM:RFP ) were cloned into the pENTR/D-Topo Gateway entry vector ( Invitrogen ) by PCR amplification with the primers carrying desired mutations ( Supplementary file 3 ) using PexRD54 and Joka2 entry clones as templates followed by TOPO cloning procedure ( Invitrogen ) . Templates were then eliminated by one-hour Dpn-I ( New England Biolabs ) restriction digestion at 37\u00b0C . Next , the entry clones of PexRD54 and Joka2 mutants were recombined into destination vectors pH7WGR2 or pB7RWG2 by Gateway LR reaction ( Invitrogen ) . pTRBO FLAG:PexRD54 construct used for coimmunoprecipitations was custom synthesized ( Genscript , , New Jersey , USA ) . To generate ATG8 interacting motif ( AIM ) mutants in PexRD54 and Joka2 , the conserved tryptophan and leucine residues of the canonical AIMs were both mutated to Alanine as previously done ( Zientara-Rytter et al . , 2011 ) . In PexRD54AIM1 , PexRD54AIM2 and Joka2AIM , the AIM motifs e . g . 'WLRL' , 'WEIV' and 'WDPI' were mutated to 'ALRA' , 'AEIA' and 'ADPA' , respectively . Nicotiana benthamiana plants were grown and maintained throughout the experiments in a greenhouse at 22\u201325\u00b0C with high light intensity . Phytophthora infestans cultures were grown in plates with rye sucrose agar ( RSA ) media for 12\u201314 days as described elsewhere ( Song et al . , 2009 ) . Sporangia were harvested from plates using cold water and zoospores were collected 1\u20133\u2009hr after incubation at 4\u00b0C . Infection assays were performed by droplet inoculations of zoospore solutions of P . infestans on 3\u20134-week-old detached N . benthamiana leaves as described previously ( Song et al . , 2009; Saunders et al . , 2012 ) . For all infection assays , P . infestans isolate 88 , 069 was used . Transient gene-expression in planta was performed by delivering T-DNA constructs with Agrobacterium tumefaciens GV3101 strain into 3\u20134-week-old N . benthamiana plants as described previously ( Bozkurt et al . , 2011 ) . For transient co-expression assays , A . tumefaciens strains carrying the plant expression constructs were mixed in a 1:1 ratio in agroinfiltration medium [10 mM MgCl2 , 5 mM 2- ( N-morpholine ) -ethanesulfonic acid ( MES ) , pH 5 . 6] to a final OD600 of 0 . 2 , unless otherwise stated . Proteins were transiently expressed by A . tumefaciens-mediated transient expression ( agroinfiltration ) in N . benthamiana leaves and harvested 2 or 3 days post infiltration . Co-IP experiments and preparation of peptides for liquid chromatography\u2013tandem mass spectrometry ( LC-MS/MS ) was performed as described previously ( Bozkurt et al . , 2011 ) . Except the stringent PexRD54 immunoprecipitation assay ( Stringent IP ) , all IPs were done using 150 mM NaCl buffer and 0 . 15% detergent concentration . For the stringent IP , the\u00a0concentrations of salt and the detergent were increased to 250 mM and to 0 . 5% , respectively . LC-MS/MS analysis was performed with a LTQ Orbitrap mass spectrometer ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , UK ) and a nanoflow-HPLC system ( nanoACQUITY; Waters Corp . , UK ) as described previously ( Petre et al . , 2015 ) . LC-MS/MS data processing and protein identification were done as described previously ( Petre et al . , 2015 ) . In planta association of PexRD54 and Joka2 with either ATG8CL , ATG8CL\u0394 or ATG8IL constructs was tested by co-IP assays as follows: constructs were transiently co-expressed in N . benthamiana leaves by agroinfiltration followed by protein extraction 2\u20133 days post infiltrations . Protein extraction , purification and western blot analysis steps were performed as described previously ( Saunders et al . , 2012; Bozkurt et al . , 2011; Oh et al . , 2009 ) . Monoclonal FLAG M2 antibody ( Sigma-Aldrich , UK ) , polyclonal GFP/RFP antibodies ( Invitrogen , UK ) , and polyclonal HA ( Sigma-Aldrich , UK ) antibody were used as primary antibodies , and anti-mouse antibody ( Sigma-Aldrich , UK ) and anti-rat ( Sigma-Aldrich , UK ) antibodies were used as secondary antibodies . To test if PexRD54 increased protein levels of ATG8CL , GFP:ATG8CL was co-expressed with RFP:GUS , RFP:PexRD54 and RFP:PexRD54AIM2 in N . benthamiana leaves . Leaf samples were collected 2 and 3 days after infiltration . Total proteins were extracted as described previously ( Saunders et al . , 2012; Oh et al . , 2009 ) and immunoblots were performed using the appropriate antisera . The same experimental setup was also used to test whether Joka2 increases protein levels of ATG8CL . Joka2:RFP , Joka2AIM:RFP and RFP:GUS constructs were co-expressed with GFP:ATG8CL construct in N . benthamina leaves and total proteins were extracted 2 and 3 days after infiltration . Immunoblots were developed using appropriate antisera . To assay ATG8CL protein levels during infection with P . infestans , N . benthamiana leaves were first infiltrated with GFP:ATG8CL construct and infected one day later with droplets from a zoospore solution of P . infestans as described earlier ( Song et al . , 2009 ) . Water droplets were used as mock treatment . Protein extracts were prepared 2 and 3 days after infection and protein levels of GFP:ATG8CL were detected by immunoblots using a polyclonal GFP-HRP antibody ( Santa Cruz , Texas , USA ) . Joka2:RFP was transiently co-expressed with GFP:ATG8CL in the presence of HA:PexRD54 , HA:PexRD54AIM , or HA:EV constructs in N . benthamiana leaves . Total proteins extracts prepared 2 days after infiltration were then used in anti-GFP Co-IPs . Purified protein complexes were separated by SDS/PAGE and immunoblotted to detect RFP , GFP and HA signals . Similar competition experiment was conveyed with increased HA:PexRD54 A . tumefaciens concentrations ( OD600=0 , 0 . 05 , 0 . 1 , 0 . 2 or 0 . 4 ) while Joka2:RFP and GFP:ATG8CL A . tumefaciens concentrations were kept fixed at OD600= 0 . 2 . Protein extracts prepared two days after infiltration were used in GFP-IPs as described above . Joka2-ATG8CL binding assays were carried out by co-expressing Joka2:RFP and GFP:ATG8CL in the presence of HA:PexRD54 , HA:PexRD54AIM2 , HA:PexRD54J2AIM1 ( PexRD54 AIM ( LDFDWEIV ) replaced by Joka2 AIM ( GVAEWDPI ) ) , HA:PexRD54J2AIM2 ( PexRD54 AIM replaced by Joka2 AIM plus 8 additional amino acids at the C-terminus ( GVAEWDPILEELKEMG ) ) or HA:EV . GFP-IPs were performed as described above . Infection assays assessing the effect of Joka2 overexpression on P . infestans colonization were performed as follow: Joka2:RFP , Joka2AIM:RFP or RFP EV were transiently overexpressed side by side on either halves of independent N . benthamiana leaves . Twenty-four hours after expression , the infiltrated leaves were detached and inoculated with P . infestans 88 , 069 on two or three spots on each half leaf . P . infestans growth was monitored by UV photography 6 days after infection . Colonization was quantified by measuring the diameter of the lesion on each inoculated spot and values from three independent biological replicates were used to generate the scatter plots . To demonstrate whether PexRD54 could alleviate the effect of Joka2 on pathogen growth , Joka2:RFP was co-expressed with HA:PexRD54 , HA:PexRD54AIM2 or HA:EV in N . benthamiana leaves , which were infected and monitored as described above . For all infection assays , experiments were repeated three times with minimum 10 infection spots . Lesion diameters were measured 6 days after infection . Virus induced gene silencing of Joka2 was performed in N . benthamiana as described previously ( Liu et al . , 2002 ) . Two different TRV2/pYL279 constructs were designed to target both 5\u2019-and 3\u2019 ends of Joka2 . TRV:Joka2-1 and TRV2:Joka2-2 targeted the region between 340\u00a0and\u00a0639 and between\u00a01942\u00a0and\u00a02241 , respectively . The primers were used for generating TRV2:Joka2-1 and TRV2:Joka2-2 are listed in Supplementary file 3 . TRV2:GFP was used as a negative control as described previously ( Chaparro-Garcia et al . , 2015 ) . Suspensions of Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV3101 harboring TRV1/pYL155 and TRV2:Joka2-1 or TRV2:Joka2-2 were mixed in a 2:1 ratio in infiltration buffer ( 10 mM MES ( 2-[N-morpholino]ethanesulfonic acid ) , 10 mM magnesium chloride ( MgCl2 ) , pH 5 . 6 ) to a final OD600 of 0 . 3 . As a control , we used TRV2:GFP . Two-week-old N . benthamiana plants were infiltrated with A . tumefaciens for VIGS assays and upper leaves were used 2\u20133 weeks later for P . infestans infections . UV photographs were taken 5 days post infection . Each experiment was repeated at least three times with minimum 10 infection spots and disease lesion areas were measured using ImageJ . Each lesion size value was normalized following the formula 'Nr = Or * Ar /A' , where N is the normalized lesion size value , O is the original lesion size value , r is the biological repeat , Xr is the average of all O values of the biological repeat r , and A is the average of all O values . Silencing levels were confirmed using RT-PCR . Total RNA was extracted using RNAeasy Plant Mini Kit ( Qiagen , UK ) and treated with Ambion TURBO DNA-free according to manufacturer\u2019s protocol . 1 . 0 \u03bcg of DNase treated RNA was used for cDNA synthesis using SuperScript\u00a0III Reverse Transcriptase ( Invitrogen ) . RT-PCR was performed with the following program: 1 cycle with 3\u2009min at 95\u00b0C , followed by 35 cycles with 95\u00b0C at 30\u2009s , 56\u00b0C at 30\u2009s and 72\u00b0C at 30\u2009s . Primers pairs used for cDNA amplification were Joka2-TRV1-F and Joka2-TRV1-R , and Joka2-TRV2-R and Joka2-TRV2-F ( described in Supplementary file 3 ) . NbEF1\u03b1 was used to normalize transcript abundance ( Segonzac et al . , 2011 ) . All microscopy analyses were performed on live leaf tissue 3 days post agroinfiltration . N . benthamiana leaf patches were cut and mounted in water and analyzed on a Leica TCS SP5 confocal microscope ( Leica Microsystems , Germany ) using 63x water immersion objective . The GFP and RFP probes were excited using 488 and 561\u00a0nm laser diodes and their fluorescent emissions were collected at 495\u2013550\u00a0nm and 570\u2013620\u00a0nm , respectively . To avoid bleed-through from different fluorophores , co-localization images were taken using sequential scanning between lines and acquired using multi-channels . Confocal microscopy images were processed with the Leica LAS AF software , ImageJ ( 2 . 0 ) and Adobe PHOTOSHOP CS5 ( 12 . 0 ) programs . Images for quantification of autophagosome numbers were obtained from 50 Z stacks consisting of 1\u00a0\u03bcm depth field multi-layered images with similar settings for all samples . To detect and quantify punctate structures in one channel ( green channel or red channel or overlay channel ( green channel images superimposed with red channel ones ) ) , the Z stacks were separated into individual images with the ImageJ ( 2 . 0 ) program and analyzed . The counting procedure was based on a naked-eye detection of punctate structures to avoid cytoplasm noise and dual counting of autophagosomes within the same stack . Histograms were generated with mean of punctate numbers generated from stacks obtained in two independent biological experiments . Statistical differences were assessed by means of a two-tailed t-test assuming unequal variance as implemented in StatPlus LE package ( AnalystSoft , Washington , USA ) . Measurements were significant when p<0 . 05 and highly significant when p<0 . 001 . Leaf samples were embedded in LR White as described ( Liu et al . , 2002 ) except sections were picked up on gold grids before immunogold labeling . All labeling procedures were carried out at room temperature . Grids were floated , section-side down , on drops of 50\u00a0mM glycine/PBS ( 150 mM NaCl , 10 mM phosphate , pH 7 . 4 ) for 15\u2009min then on Aurion blocking buffer ( 5% BSA/0 . 1% cold water fish gelatin/5\u201310% normal goat serum/15 mM NaN3/PBS , pH7 . 4 ) ( Aurion , the\u00a0Netherlands ) for 30 min then briefly equilibrated in incubation buffer ( 0 . 1% ( v/v ) BSA-C ( actetylated BSA; Aurion ) /PBS , pH 7 . 3 ) before a 90 min\u2019 incubation with the primary antibody . Serial sections on separate grids were labelled with either a rabbit polyclonal anti-GFP Abcam ab6556 ( Abcam , UK ) at 1/250 , or a rabbit polyclonal anti-catalase AS09 501 ( Newmarket Scientific , UK ) at 1/1000 . Grids were washed 6x5 min in drops of incubation buffer then placed on the\u00a0drops of goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody conjugated to 10 nm gold ( BioCell , Agar Scientific Ltd . , Essex , UK ) , diluted to 1/50 in incubation buffer , for 90 min . After 6x5\u2009min washes in incubation buffer and 2x5\u2009min washes in PBS , the grids were briefly washed in water and contrast stained with 2% ( w/v ) uranyl acetate . Grids were viewed in a FEI Tecnai 20 transmission electron microscope ( FEI , the\u00a0Netherlands ) at 200\u00a0kV and digital TIFF images were taken using an AMT XR60B digital camera ( Deben , UK ) to record TIFF files . Bar charts were generated by counting the clustered ( >4 gold particles close to each other ) gold particles on each image . 3-Methyl adenine ( 3-MA ) , a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ( PI3K ) inhibitor is widely used to inhibit autophagosome formation ( Hanamata et al . , 2013 ) . N . benthamiana leaves transiently expressing GFP:ATG8CL-RFP:PexRD54 , GFP:PexRD54-RFP:ATG8CL or YFP:VTI12 were infiltrated with 5\u00a0mM 3-MA . Both GFP:PexRD54 and RFP:ATG8CL constructs were expressed side by side to monitor the effect of 3-MA treatment on stimulation of autophagosome formation by PexRD54 . Punctate structures were visualized using confocal microscopy 6\u201310\u2009hr after 3-MA treatment . Bar charts were generated with the\u00a0number of punctate structures obtained from maximum projections of Z-stack images of two independent biological experiments . The cysteine protease inhibitor E64d is widely used for measuring autophagic flux ( Bassham , 2015 ) . To determine whether PexRD54 blocked autophagic flux , at 2 dpi we infiltrated leaves with 100 \u03bcM E64D and kept them overnight in the dark . At 3 dpi , we collected E64d treated and untreated samples and analyzed total protein levels using appropriate antisera . Concanamycin A ( 2 \u03bcM in agro infiltration medium ) was infiltrated into leaves of N . benthamiana transiently expressing ATG8CL and PexRD54 , PexRD54AIM2 or empty vector control constructs . The leaves were than incubated in dark at 20\u00b0C for 24\u2009hr . ATG8CL-labelled puncta were visualized using confocal microscopy 24\u2009hr after concanamycin A treatment . DNA encoding PexRD54 residues Val92 to Val381 ( lacking secretion and translocation signals ) was amplified from RFP:PexRD54 ( using primers shown in Supplementary file 3 ) and cloned into the vector pOPINS3C , resulting in an N-terminal 6xHis-SUMO tag with PexRD54 , linked by a 3C cleavage site ( Berrow et al . , 2007 ) . Recombinant protein was produced using E . coli BL21-Arabinose Inducible ( AI ) cells . Cell cultures were grown in Power Broth at 37\u00b0C to an A650 0 . 4\u20130 . 6 followed by induction with 0 . 2% ( w/v ) L-arabinose and overnight incubation at 18\u00b0C . Pelleted cells were resuspended in buffer A ( 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8 , 500 mM NaCl , 50 mM glycine , 5% ( v/v ) glycerol and 20 mM imidazole supplemented with EDTA free protease inhibitor tablets ( one tablet per 40 ml buffer ) ) and lysed by sonication . The clarified cell lysate was applied to a Ni2+-NTA column connected to an AKTA Xpress system . 6xHis-SUMO-PexRD54 was step-eluted with elution buffer ( buffer A containing 500 mM imidazole ) and directly injected onto a Superdex 75 26/600 gel filtration column pre-equilibrated in buffer C ( 20 mM HEPES pH 7 . 5 , 150 mM NaCl ) . The fractions containing 6xHis-SUMO-PexRD54 were pooled and concentrated to 2\u20133 mg/mL . The 6xHis-SUMO tag was cleaved by addition of 3C protease ( 10 \u00b5g/mg fusion protein ) and incubated at 4\u00b0C overnight . Cleaved PexRD54 was further purified using Ni2+-NTA column ( collecting eluate ) followed by gel filtration . The purified protein was concentrated as appropriate , and the final concentration was judged by absorbance at 280 nm ( using a calculated molar extinction coefficient of PexRD54 , 57 , 040 M-1cm-1 ) . The PexRD54AIM2 variant was amplified from RFP:RD54AIM2 ( using primers shown in Supplementary file 3 ) and cloned into the vector pOPINS3C as above . Recombinant protein was expressed and purified as for wild-type PexRD54; with protein concentration measured using a calculated molar extinction coefficient of 51 , 350 M-1cm-1 . DNA encoding Met1 to Ser119 of ATG8CL and Gly2 to Ser119 of ATG8IL were amplified from GFP:ATG8CL and GFP:ATG8IL ( using primers shown in Supplementary file 3 ) and cloned into the vector pOPINF , generating a cleavable N-terminal 6xHis-tag with ATG8CL and ATG8IL . Recombinant proteins were produced using E . coli strain BL21 ( DE3 ) grown in lysogeny broth at 37\u00b0C to an A600 of 0 . 4\u20130 . 6 followed by induction with 1\u00a0mM IPTG and overnight incubation at 18\u00b0C . Pelleted cells were resuspended in buffer A and pure , concentrated protein prepared as described for PexRD54 above ( concentration determined using a calculated molar extinction coefficient of 7680 M-1cm-1 and 9080 M-1cm-1 for ATG8CL and ATG8IL , respectively ) . Calorimetry experiments were carried out at 15\u00b0C in 20 mM HEPES pH 7 . 5 , 500 mM NaCl , using an iTC200 instrument ( MicroCal Inc . ) . For protein:protein interactions , the calorimetric cell was filled with 100 \u03bcM PexRD54 and titrated with 1 . 1 mM ATG8CL or ATG8IL from the syringe . A single injection of 0 . 5 \u03bcl of ATG8CL or ATG8IL was followed by 19 injections of 2 \u03bcl each . Injections were made at 150 s intervals with a stirring speed of 750 rpm . For the heats of dilution control experiments , equivalent volumes of ATG8CL or ATG8IL were injected into buffer using the parameters above . For protein:peptide interactions , the calorimetric cell was filled with 90 \u03bcM ATG8CL or ATG8IL and titrated with 1 mM peptide from the syringe . The titrations were performed at 25\u00b0C , but otherwise as above . The raw titration data were integrated and fitted to a one-site binding model using the MicroCal Origin software .

{"lay_summary": "When the supply of oxygen to the heart is reduced , its cells start to die within hours , the heart muscle becomes less able to contract , and the area becomes inflamed . This inflammation is accompanied by an influx of immune cells . It also activates other cells known as cardiac fibroblasts that help to break down the framework of molecules that supported the damaged heart tissue and replace it with a scar . This response is part of the normal repair process , but it can lead to the formation of scar tissue in non-damaged areas of the heart . Excess scar tissue makes the heart muscle less able to contract and increases the affected individual\u2019s chance of dying . Understanding how this repair process works is an important step in developing strategies to minimise the damage caused by coronary artery disease or heart attacks . However , existing laboratory models are only partly able to recreate the conditions seen in real heart tissue . To properly understand the response at the level of living cells , a more complete model is needed . Ugolini et al . now report improvements to a small device , referred to as a lab-on-chip , that can subject cells to mechanical strain . The improvements mean the device could also recreate other conditions seen early on in damaged heart tissue , specifically the reduced supply of oxygen . Replicating combinations of mechanical changes and oxygen supplies meant that the impact of these conditions on human cardiac fibroblasts could be directly observed in the laboratory for the first time . Ugolini et al . found that a lack of contraction and low oxygen levels triggered the cardiac fibroblasts to produce inflammatory molecules and molecules associated with the formation of scar tissue . This resembles the response seen in living hearts . The next step is to improve the lab-on-chip device further by adding other cell types , including heart muscle cells and immune cells . A more complete model may aid future research into how our hearts operate in both health and disease .", "article": "Upon cardiac pathological conditions such as ischemia , microenvironmental changes instruct a series of cellular responses that trigger cardiac fibroblasts-mediated tissue adaptation and inflammation . A comprehensive model of how early environmental changes may induce cardiac fibroblasts ( CF ) pathological responses is far from being elucidated , partly due to the lack of approaches involving complex and simultaneous environmental stimulation . Here , we provide a first analysis of human primary CF behavior by means of a multi-stimulus microdevice for combined application of cyclic mechanical strain and controlled oxygen tension . Our findings elucidate differential human CFs responses to different combinations of the above stimuli . Individual stimuli cause proliferative effects ( PHH3+ mitotic cells , YAP translocation , PDGF secretion ) or increase collagen presence . Interestingly , only the combination of hypoxia and a simulated loss of contractility ( 2% strain ) is able to additionally induce increased CF release of inflammatory and pro-fibrotic cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases . \n When supply of oxygen and nutrients to the myocardium is critically reduced ( ischemia ) , a complex tissue response takes place: within hours tissue necrosis and death of contractile cardiac myocytes occurs in the infarcted area giving rise to an inflammatory phase that recruits immune cells and activates quiescent cardiac fibroblasts ( CFs ) ; within a few days a proliferative phase begins , where activated CFs invade the infarcted area and contribute to degrading and replacing the extra-cellular matrix with a collagen-based scar; within weeks the maturation of the fibrotic scar is completed ( Frangogiannis , 2014; Heusch et al . , 2014 ) . Cellular and molecular events such as excessive proliferation of CFs , phenotypic switch of CFs , high levels of inflammatory cytokines and humoral factors , unbalanced synthesis of extracellular matrix ( ECM ) proteins and matrix metalloproteinases ( MMP ) -mediated degradation of ECM are generally regarded as hallmarks of early fibrotic tissue response ( Fan et al . , 2012; Krenning et al . , 2010; Porter and Turner , 2009; Shinde and Frangogiannis , 2014 ) . This essential process maintains tissue integrity , however , it often leads to excessive and adverse CFs remodeling of non-infarcted areas ( Fan et al . , 2012; Kania et al . , 2009; Talman and Ruskoaho , 2016 ) associated with cardiac dysfunction and increased mortality ( Okada et al . , 2005 ) . Controlled anti-fibrotic strategies still require deeper understanding and advanced models of cardiac fibrosis mechanisms ( Leask , 2010; Roubille et al . , 2014 ) . In general , the onset of pathological myocardial conditions causes alterations of specific environmental cues at the cellular scale: mechanical strain decreases ( loss of contractility ) ; oxygen and nutrient levels dramatically decrease ( ischemia ) ; levels of inflammatory cytokines increase ( post-injury inflammatory response ) . In an attempt to provide in vitro models of cardiac disease , CFs have been widely studied under relevant physico-chemical stimulation such as mechanical stress ( Schroer and Merryman , 2015; Tomasek et al . , 2002 ) , oxygen deprivation ( Clancy et al . , 2007; Tamamori et al . , 1997 ) and biochemical stimulation with pro-fibrotic cytokines ( Edgley et al . , 2012; Lijnen et al . , 2000; Petrov et al . , 2002 ) . The application of mechanical stress has been shown to have the following effects on CFs: increased ECM protein synthesis ( Carver et al . , 1991 ) ; controversial proliferative behavior ( Atance et al . , 2004; Butt and Bishop , 1997; Dalla Costa et al . , 2010; Liao et al . , 2004 ) , with recent reports of strain intensity-dependent effects ( Ugolini et al . , 2016 ) ; increased production of pro-fibrotic and inflammatory cytokines such as TGF-\u03b2 ( transforming growth factor-beta ) ( Leask , 2007 ) and TNF-\u03b1 ( tumor necrosis factor-alpha ) ( Yokoyama et al . , 1999 ) . While previous mechanical stress experiments were performed in a normoxic environment ( NX , approximately 20% O2 , the standard oxygen level of ambient air ) , CFs were shown to be sensitive to O2 level variations from physoxia ( PX ) , defined as the physiologic oxygen level in living tissues ( about 5\u20136% O2 in the myocardium [Gonschior et al . , 1992; Roy et al . , 2003; Sen et al . , 2006; Winegrad et al . , 1999] ) . Both hypoxia ( HX , 1\u20133% O2 ) and NX induce a pro-inflammatory and fibrogenic phenotype in cultured CFs ( Roy et al . , 2003; Sen and Roy , 2010 ) . These findings imply that normoxic oxygen levels are perceived by CFs as a state of hyperoxia and that a significant bias exists when culturing CFs in non-physiological oxygen environments . The exposure of CFs to HX has been shown to induce collagen production and proliferation of CFs ( Gao et al . , 2014; Tamamori et al . , 1997 ) , while studies suggest that MMP-based remodeling may not be triggered by HX alone ( Riches et al . , 2009 ) . Given the complexity of in vivo pathological evolution , the elucidation of how environmental stimuli interplay and guide cellular responses is paramount . To date , no comprehensive model is able to recapitulate early cellular events taking place after acute myocardial injury and there is no report of cardiac cells subjected to simultaneous mechanical strain and controlled oxygen changes , two major environmental variables involved in cardiac injury and CF adaptive responses . This is mostly due to the lack of compact platforms enabling the controlled application of multiple stimuli . To address this need , we here report the improvement of a previously described multi-chamber microdevice dedicated to the application of cyclic strain to cell monolayers ( Ugolini et al . , 2016 ) . By adding a system for controlling oxygen changes , we significantly expanded the experimental complexity and mimicking capabilities of the device . We here finely controlled the applied mechanical strain and oxygen regimes sensed by CFs to model early environmental changes in cardiac injury and provide insights into individual or synergistic contributions of the environmental signals in the activation of early CF responses relevant to cardiac fibrotic disease . Shortly after an ischemic myocardial insult ( e . g . , acute coronary artery occlusion ) tissue oxygen levels drop from approximately 5\u20136% O2 ( Gonschior et al . , 1992; Sen et al . , 2006; Winegrad et al . , 1999 ) to near-zero ( Roy et al . , 2003 ) , rapidly inducing loss of cardiac myocytes contractility . In terms of in vitro model parameters , we thus selected 5% O2 ( PX ) as a physiological oxygen level and 1% O2 ( HX ) as an oxygen level characteristic of ischemic myocardial injury . Dramatic alterations of injured myocardial tissue also take place in early timeframes: tissue bulging and dilations are commonly observed together with loss of contractile function ( Eek et al . , 2010; Pfeffer and Braunwald , 1990; Picard et al . , 1990; Tennant and Wiggers , 1935 ) . Cardiac imaging studies agree in the interpretation that global strains are abruptly reduced shortly after myocardial insult ( Flachskampf et al . , 2011; Hoit , 2011; Mollema et al . , 2010 ) . Quantitatively , strain values recorded vary significantly throughout the heart . Although absolute values may depend on imaging algorithms , strains in ischemic/injured regions have been reported to be 2\u20134 fold lower than in healthy myocardial regions ( e . g . less than 3% in ischemic regions versus approximately 10% in healthy regions [Dandel et al . , 2009; Vartdal et al . , 2007] ) . Within this range and in line with previous in vitro observations of CFs behavior ( Ugolini et al . , 2016 ) , we selected 2% strain as indicative of reduced contractility and 8% strain as representative of full myocardial contractility . These environmental changes and the following initial cellular responses happen in a timeframe of hours , as shown in vitro ( van Nieuwenhoven et al . , 2013; Turner et al . , 2007 , 2009 ) as well as in vivo ( Guill\u00e9n et al . , 1995; Morishita et al . , 2015 ) . We thus performed experiments lasting 24 hr and evaluated the main early aspects that govern fibrotic responses in the injured myocardium: ECM remodeling , with stainings for collagen I and quantifications of MMP expression; proliferation of CFs , with analyses of mitotic cells , Hippo pathway signaling and mitogenic PDGF ( platelet-derived growth factor ) expression; secretion of inflammatory and pro-fibrotic cytokines in CF supernatants; myofibroblast differentiation , through stainings for \u03b1SMA ( \u03b1-smooth muscle actin ) . Results of our investigation provide insights into how the combination of environmental stimuli may act synergistically or independently to drive in vitro adaptive early CF responses . \n Myocardial pathological remodeling is largely based on unbalanced CF production of collagen I and MMP-mediated matrix remodeling . To analyze CF-mediated early remodeling events under combined stimulations , we analyzed immunofluorescence images of CFs stained for collagen I . In addition , we quantified the expression of MMP-2 and MMP-3 in cell culture supernatants , two enzymes specifically expressed by CFs during cardiac remodeling ( Fan et al . , 2012 ) . While CFs normally exhibit diffuse cytoplasmic staining for collagen I , an intense staining localized to perinuclear regions of CFs was observed after 24 hr under specific stimulations ( Figure 1A ) . Based on analysis of intracellular fluorescence intensity , we found that the increase in collagen I was similarly triggered by HX alone and 8% strain alone ( Figure 1B ) . No significant synergy was found for the two stimulations: levels of collagen I are similarly elevated in all HX conditions regardless of strain applied . Correspondingly , collagen I staining exhibits similar intensity in all 8% strain conditions regardless of the oxygen stimulation employed . After only 12 hr of stimulation , collagen I fluorescence showed similar trends , with the exception of HX combined with 8% cyclic strain which provided a greater synergistic effect compared to the single stimulations ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . We also report that culturing CFs at NX levels does not induce significant changes in collagen I presence . 10 . 7554/eLife . 22847 . 003Figure 1 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 22847 . 005 The expression of MMP-2 and MMP-3 in CFs supernatants ( Figure 1CD ) was significantly influenced by combined mechanical strain and oxygen changes . MMP-2 was more prominently expressed than MMP-3 ( >100X higher ) . Nevertheless , the expression of both enzymes was similarly regulated by the pattern of stimulations applied: a significant two-fold increase in MMP-2 and MMP-3 expression was induced by the combination of HX and mechanical strain , with a more pronounced increase observed in the HX/2% strain combined conditions . MMP-3 expression was negatively affected when CFs were subjected to mechanical strain at PX or HX stimulus alone . During the proliferative phase of myocardial healing , excessive CF proliferation is observed as well as a phenotypic switch giving rise to the fibrotic response . In order to understand how environmental stimuli modulate the proliferation of human CFs , we examined the fraction of mitotic cells ( PHH3+/DAPI ) under combined mechanical stimulation and changes in oxygen tension . Figure 2A shows representative images of CFs stained for PHH3 and DAPI . Without application of cyclic strain , we observed a two-fold significant increase in the number of mitotic cells ( Figure 2B ) when CFs were stimulated with HX compared to their PX counterparts . Mechanical strain significantly impacted cell proliferation within the PX culture condition: culturing CFs at PX and subjecting them to 2% strain induced a striking increase in mitotic cells compared to no strain control and 8% strain cultures . This strain intensity-dependent effect is in line with our previous investigations of CF proliferation under mechanical strain in NX conditions ( Ugolini et al . , 2016 ) . After 12 hr of stimulation , the proliferative increase with HX is not statistically significant , while we report a significant synergistic decrease of mitotic cells induced by the combination of 8% strain and HX ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 22847 . 006Figure 2 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 22847 . 008 In addition , we performed mitotic cell counts on CFs cultured under NX conditions without mechanical strain in order to evaluate any influence of non-physiological oxygen environments on CF proliferation . Interestingly , CFs exhibited much greater mitosis under NX environments ( approx . 5% mitotic cells ) compared to PX environments ( approx . 1% mitotic cells ) denoting a strong proliferative effect of standard cell culture environments . Further , we evaluated the effects of the environmental changes on YAP , a transcription factor mainly known as the principal effector of the Hippo proliferative pathway , a crucial pathway involved in cardiac regeneration and repair ( Papizan and Olson , 2014; Xin et al . , 2013 ) . Recent literature has also described a parallel mechano-sensing associated role of YAP ( Dupont et al . , 2011; Mosqueira et al . , 2014 ) . YAP translocation from cytoplasm to nucleus leads to inactivation of Hippo pathway and a subsequent increase in cell proliferation . We therefore quantified nuclear localization of YAP by means of immunofluorescence , which revealed that the fraction of CFs displaying nuclear YAP is influenced by the combination of stimuli with trends similar to the fraction of mitotic cells ( Figure 2C , D ) . In CFs cultured at PX , 2% strain induces higher YAP translocation into cell nuclei . CFs solely exposed to HX environment show a significant two-fold increase in nuclear YAP compared to a PX environment . Mechanical strain shows a negative interaction when combined with HX , with CFs subject to HX/8% strain condition showing lower fractions of nuclear YAP compared to CFs subject to HX alone . This effect can also be observed in the analysis of mitotic cells , although the result is not statistically significant . Interestingly , CFs cultured in an NX environment show a three-fold increase in nuclear YAP compared to PX conditions . Finally , we detected the expression of PDGF in CF supernatants . PDGF has been described as a potent mitogen for CFs , is significantly over-expressed in in vivo models of heart injury ( Zhao et al . , 2011 ) , and has recently been studied as a putative pharmacological target for attenuating adverse effects of cardiac fibrotic disease ( Liu et al . , 2014 ) . Expression of PDGF in CF culture supernatant ( Figure 2E ) was significantly affected by HX stimulation: a four-fold increase in the detected amounts of PDGF was observed in HX compared to PX , without application of cyclic strain . Mechanical stimulation showed a negative interaction with the HX-induced secretion of PDGF: while levels of PDGF expression remain elevated under HX/2% strain , application of 8% cyclic strain shows a negative regulation of PDGF secretion back to PX levels of expression . Acute inflammatory tissue responses after myocardial injuries are thought to be largely based on cellular signaling by means of secreted factors . The precise contribution of CFs in the regulation of the early inflammatory response in myocardial remodeling is still to be determined , however , recent reports suggest that CFs play a key role in modulating a functional inflammasome that includes inflammatory and pro-fibrotic cytokines ( Kawaguchi et al . , 2011; Lindner et al . , 2014; Turner , 2016 ) . We therefore studied the amount of inflammatory cytokines ( namely interleukins IL-1\u03b2 , IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 ) and of pro-fibrotic TGF-\u03b2 in CF culture supernatants after 24 hr of combined stimulations ( Figure 3 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 22847 . 009Figure 3 . Analyses of pro-fibrotic and pro-inflammatory cytokines in supernatants of CFs . ( A ) TGF-\u03b2 expression in supernatants .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 22847 . 010 TGF-\u03b2 is a major contributor to fibrotic responses , widely studied across a variety of tissues and organs . During post-injury myocardial remodeling , TGF-\u03b2 is known to stimulate a wide range of CF responses from phenotypic switch to collagen synthesis and ECM remodeling ( Leask , 2007 ) . CFs stimulated with a combination of HX and mechanical strain ( specifically 2% strain ) were found to increase secretion of TGF-\u03b2 by approximately two-fold . CFs cultured at PX expressed lower amounts of TGF-\u03b2 , regardless of the mechanical strain applied ( Figure 3A ) . IL1-\u03b2 is one of the first cytokines detected in vivo after myocardial injury ( Guill\u00e9n et al . , 1995 ) and is known to stimulate CF response including the production of MMPs ( Brown et al . , 2007; Guo et al . , 2008; Siwik et al . , 2000 ) . Interestingly , we found that a significant two-fold increase in IL1-\u03b2 expression occurred only when CFs were subjected to the combination of HX and mechanical strain , particularly with 2% strain ( Figure 3B ) . Conversely , we observed how the expression of inflammatory cytokines TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 was not influenced by the application of environmental stimuli . We detected extremely low amounts of TNF-\u03b1 ( Figure 3C ) , with non-significant variations across all stimulation conditions . IL-6 ( Figure 3D ) was abundantly expressed by CFs yet none of the differences in its expression were found to be statistically significant . In the remodeling myocardium , CFs undergo a phenotypic modulation to myofibroblasts , a motile and contractile cell type that maintains tissue integrity and promotes scar formation and tissue fibrosis ( Santiago et al . , 2010 ) . The hallmark of this phenotype switch is the expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin ( \u03b1SMA ) that , by being incorporated into actin stress fibers , confers increased mechanical and motile capabilities to differentiated myofibroblasts ( Baum and Duffy , 2011 ) . To analyze whether CFs differentiation into myofibroblasts took place under environmental changes we evaluated expression and localization of \u03b1SMA after 24 hr of combined stimulation . Immunostainings of CFs ( Figure 4 ) reveal that a basal expression of cytoplasmic \u03b1SMA is present in all combined stimulation conditions . However , under no experimental condition did CFs exhibit co-localization of \u03b1SMA ( red ) and actin stress fibers ( green ) , indicating that differentiation into myofibroblasts was not induced by our pattern of environmental stimuli . Conversely , stimulating CFs by supplementing TGF-\u03b2 in the culture medium ( a known inducer of CF differentiation to myofibroblasts ) caused the appearance of cells exhibiting superimposed \u03b1SMA and actin signal ( yellow ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 22847 . 011Figure 4 .

( G ) Positive control for \u03b1SMA immunofluorescence through stimulation with 30 ng/ml TGF-\u03b2: CFs exhibit co-localization of \u03b1SMA staining with actin stress fibers ( resulting in yellow signal ) denoting differentiation into myofibroblasts ( white arrows ) .

Replicating for the first time the combination of oxygen changes and mechanical cues , we revealed how these environmental stimulations combine to trigger CF pathological responses and highlighted emerging adaptive cellular mechanisms . We found that mimicking the combination of HX and reduced contractility proved crucial in eliciting inflammatory and fibrotic remodeling responses of CFs , while individual environmental stimuli only regulated proliferative and collagen-related responses . These insights have impact on future studies of pathological myocardial remodeling and the in vitro model here described provides a tool for better understanding pathological mechanisms and tailoring reparative strategies . \n Figure 5 shows a detailed representation of oxygen dynamics and mechanical strain conditions employed ( Figure 5A and B ) together with a timeline of experiments ( Figure 5C ) . After cells seeding , CFs were kept in static incubation for 12 hr in order to allow for cell adhesion . Subsequently \u2013 being this initial time-point referred to as t0 \u2013 CFs seeded in the inlet and outlet wells of the culture chambers were manually scraped , aspirated and stimulations were started . We employed two mechanical stimulation regimes ( Figure 5B ) : 2% strain or 8% strain at 1 Hz . Concerning the oxygenation stimulus applied , the microdevices were employed at a base environmental oxygen level corresponding to physoxia ( 5% O2 ) in order to precisely model the oxygen levels in healthy myocardium until t0 . Then , two oxygen concentration dynamics were imposed ( Figure 5C ) : ( i ) a static incubation at 5% O2 ( physoxia , PX ) for 24 hr , ( ii ) an abrupt reduction of oxygen concentrations to 1% O2 that was maintained for 24 hr ( hypoxia , HX ) . CFs were subject to all possible combinations of the above stimuli ( six total conditions ) for a total of 24 hr . Immunofluorescence analyses were performed after 12 hr and 24 hr of stimulation , while cell culture supernatants were collected and analyzed after 24 hr of stimulation . Immunofluorescence analyses were also performed on CFs cultured at NX levels under 0% strain condition to investigate responses induced by culturing CFs in non-physiological NX environments , a standard condition for most previous studies on CFs . 10 . 7554/eLife . 22847 . 015Figure 5 .

Briefly , four stretching units are arranged in a single device composed of a thin polydimethylsiloxane ( PDMS ) membrane sandwiched between two microstructured PDMS layers . Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1 shows a picture of the microdevice together with a sketched cross-section of a stretching unit of the device . In each stretching unit , a central culture chamber ( blue ) is flanked by two actuation chambers ( red ) connected to a single actuation line , meant for vacuum application and straining of the central membrane . A lower fluidic channel ( green ) , common to all units , is designed for environmental conditioning and flows below each central culture chamber . Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1 also shows the stimulation system: microdevices were actuated by a vacuum line for generating mechanical strain and a gas line for controlling oxygen concentrations . As for the vacuum line , programmable electromechanical valves modulated the vacuum to switch cyclically from atmospheric pressure to the desired vacuum pressure ( namely \u2212200 mmHg for 2% strain and \u2212600 mmHg for 8% strain , applied for half a cycle at a rate of 1 Hz ) . The pneumatic stretch system was previously described and validated ( Ugolini et al . , 2016 ) . The flowrate of humidified gas mixture ( 95% N2; 5% CO2 ) was regulated with a flowmeter and delivered to the microdevices through low-permeability gas tubing . Numerical modeling and experimental characterization of the oxygen control system is described in Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2 . Numerical models of a 2D cross-section of the microdevice culture chamber show that the spatial distribution of oxygen tension is uniform along the width of the culture membrane , with limited border effect near the side walls ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2A , B ) . We employed a needle-based , fine-tip ( spatial resolution \u2248 50 \u00b5m ) oxygen sensor adjusted with a micromanipulator ( PreSens , Germany ) to reach the culture membrane . Measured oxygen concentration values confirm that the culture membrane is conditioned to \u22481% O2 at varying flowrates and consistently throughout all four culture chambers ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2C , D ) . The low-oxygen conditioning occurs within seconds , while reoxygenation occurs within minutes ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2E ) . Membrane strains upon application of varying gas flowrates were measured as previously described ( Ugolini et al . , 2016 ) . Gas flowrates of 5 ml/min and 15 ml/min do not cause significant membrane strain ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2F ) . Normal human ventricular cardiac fibroblasts from one donor were purchased from Lonza ( Lonza Bioscience , Singapore ) . Cells were cultured in FGM-3 medium ( Lonza Bioscience , Singapore ) and in a humidified incubator at 90% N2 , 5% O2 , 5% CO2 at all times unless otherwise indicated . Microdevices were autoclave-sterilized , plasma-treated and coated with human fibronectin ( Sigma-Aldrich , Singapore ) for 30 min at room temperature . Cells were seeded for experiments at a passage number of four . After pre-loading each culture chamber of the microdevices with 80 \u00b5l of medium , 20 \u00b5l of cell suspension ( 106 cells/ml ) were manually injected in the wells of the culture chambers . During experiments , microdevices were kept in humidified chambers to avoid culture medium evaporation . Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min . After 15 min of permeabilization with PBS containing 0 . 5% Triton-X , cells were blocked for 1 hr at room temperature with 3% bovine serum albumin . Cells were then probed overnight at 4\u00b0C with the following primary antibodies: anti-collagen I ( mouse , AbCam , UK; RRID:AB_305411 ) , to identify alterations in collagen I in the culture; anti-phospho-Histone-H3 ( PHH3 , Ser10 , rabbit , Santa-Cruz , US; RRID:AB_2233067 ) , for mitotic cells; anti-YAP ( rabbit , Santa-Cruz , US; RRID:AB_2273277 ) to localize nuclear or cytoplasmic localization of the YAP/TAZ complex , a mechano-sensing associated transcription factor and main effector of the Hippo proliferative pathway; anti-\u03b1SMA ( Smooth Muscle Actin , rabbit , AbCam , UK; RRID:AB_2223021 ) to identify myofibroblast differentiation from expression and localization of \u03b1SMA . CFs cultured under standard culture medium supplemented with 30 ng/ml TGF-\u03b2 ( Sigma-Aldrich , Singapore ) were considered positive controls for \u03b1SMA stainings . The following secondary antibodies were used for 2 hr at room temperature: goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488 and goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 564 ( AbCam , UK ) . Nuclear staining was performed by incubating cells with DAPI . Negative controls were present for all immunofluorescence stainings . Images were acquired with a Zeiss 710 Confocal microscope . Imaging parameters were not changed during acquisitions . For quantitative analyses of immunofluorescence markers , three images per culture chamber were taken at 10X magnification , thus sampling roughly half of the total area of the culture membrane and screening about 500 cells per replicate . Images were acquired from the central region of the culture membrane . Collagen I analyses were performed by intracellular fluorescence intensity quantification: the intracellular integrated density parameter was calculated by manually drawing outlines of about 50 cells per replicate from images , correcting for background intensity and normalizing for cell area . Cell proliferation analyses were performed by manually counting nuclei positive for PHH3 and dividing by the total number of nuclei ( automatically counted ) to estimate the fraction of mitotic cells . YAP localization analyses were performed by manually discriminating cytoplasmic or nuclear staining as previously described ( Codelia et al . , 2014; Dupont et al . , 2011 ) and dividing by the total number of nuclei ( automatically counted ) to estimate the level of YAP nuclear translocation . A volume of culture medium ( 100 \u00b5l ) was collected per each culture chamber from the microfluidic devices after 24 hr . Supernatants were stored at \u221280\u00b0C prior to analysis . Residual cells and debris in the supernatant were removed by centrifugation . Concentrations of secreted factors in the supernatants were assessed via multiplex bead-based array according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions ( Luminex , Austin , TX ) . Each measurement was run in duplicate . All data are presented as mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD . Statistical comparisons were performed using GraphPad ( Prism ) software . All data were initially analyzed for normality using Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests . Two-way ANOVA tests followed by Bonferroni post-hoc tests were applied to determine statistical significance of differences and evaluate synergistic or separate contribution of mechanical strain stimulation and oxygen dynamics stimulation . When data groups did not pass normality tests , non-parametric statistical tests were employed ( Kruskal-Wallis test ) . A p-value lower than 0 . 05 was considered significant . All data were collected from a pool of six independent experiments with a minimum number of biological replicates of four . We designed the approximate sample size required for the study by performing power analysis based on previously reported data on human cardiac fibroblasts ( CF ) proliferative responses under mechanical strain ( Ugolini et al . , 2016 ) . In addition , we considered preliminary data obtained from human CFs cultured at different oxygen levels . An effect size was computed from this data ( fraction of mitotic PHH3+ cells under 2% vs . 8% strain: 2 . 0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00 . 5 vs . 0 . 5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00 . 3; expression of MMPs at physoxia vs . hypoxia: 1 . 02\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00 . 2 vs . 2 . 00\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00 . 1 ng/ml ) . An a priori power analysis performed with GPower ( v . 3 . 1 ) software assured that a sample size of n\u00a0=\u00a04 is sufficient to achieve \u03b1\u00a0=\u00a00 . 01 and 1-\u03b2 ( power ) =\u00a00 . 90 .", "headings": ["Abstract", "Introduction", "Results", "Discussion", "Materials and methods"], "keywords": ["medicine"], "id": "elife-22847-v3"}
{"lay_summary": "Cells contain a large number of proteins that control the activity of genes in response to various signals and changes in their environment . Often these proteins work together in groups called complexes . In the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster , one of these complexes is called DOMINO . The DOMINO complex alters gene activity by interacting with other proteins called histones which influence how the genes are packaged and accessed within the cell . DOMINO works in two separate ways . First , it can replace certain histones with other variants that regulate genes differently . Second , it can modify histones by adding a chemical marker to them , which alters how they interact with genes . It was not clear how DOMINO can do both of these things and how that is controlled; but it was known that cells can make two different forms of the central component of the complex , called DOM-A and DOM-B , which are both encoded by the same gene . Scacchetti et al . have now studied fruit flies to understand the activities of these forms . This revealed that they do have different roles and that gene activity in cells changes if either one is lost . The two forms operate as part complexes with different compositions and only DOM-A includes the TIP60 enzyme that is needed to modify histones . As such , it seems that DOM-B primarily replaces histones with variant forms , while DOM-A modifies existing histones . This means that each form has a unique role associated with each of the two known behaviors of this complex . The presence of two different DOMINO complexes is common to flies and , probably , other insects . Yet , in other living things , such as mammals and yeast , their two roles are carried out by protein complexes originating from two distinct genes . This illustrates a concept called convergent evolution , where different organisms find different solutions for the same problem . As such , these findings provide an insight into the challenges encountered through evolution and the diverse solutions that have developed . They will also help us to understand the ways in which protein activities can adapt to different needs over evolutionary time .", "article": "Histone acetylation and deposition of H2A . Z variant are integral aspects of active transcription . In Drosophila , the single DOMINO chromatin regulator complex is thought to combine both activities via an unknown mechanism . Here we show that alternative isoforms of the DOMINO nucleosome remodeling ATPase , DOM-A and DOM-B , directly specify two distinct multi-subunit complexes . Both complexes are necessary for transcriptional regulation but through different mechanisms . The DOM-B complex incorporates H2A . V ( the fly ortholog of H2A . Z ) genome-wide in an ATP-dependent manner , like the yeast SWR1 complex . The DOM-A complex , instead , functions as an ATP-independent histone acetyltransferase complex similar to the yeast NuA4 , targeting lysine 12 of histone H4 . Our work provides an instructive example of how different evolutionary strategies lead to similar functional separation . In yeast and humans , nucleosome remodeling and histone acetyltransferase complexes originate from gene duplication and paralog specification . Drosophila generates the same diversity by alternative splicing of a single gene . \n Nucleosomes , the fundamental units of chromatin , are inherently stable and organized in polymeric fibers of variable compactness ( Baldi et al . , 2018; Erdel and Rippe , 2018 ) . The dynamic properties of the fiber required for gene regulation are implemented by several broad principles . ATP-dependent nucleosome remodeling factors slide or evict nucleosomes ( Clapier et al . , 2017 ) , chemical modifications of histones create new interaction surfaces ( Bowman and Poirier , 2015; Zhao and Garcia , 2015 ) and histone variants furnish nucleosomes with special features ( Talbert and Henikoff , 2017 ) . The very conserved H2A variant H2A . Z accounts for\u00a0~5\u201310% of the total H2A-type histone pool in vertebrates ( Redon et al . , 2002; Thatcher and Gorovsky , 1994 ) and flies ( Bonnet et al . , 2019 ) . H2A . Z is primarily found at active promoters and enhancers , where it is thought to be important to regulate transcription initiation and early elongation ( Adam et al . , 2001; Weber et al . , 2010; Weber et al . , 2014 ) . In Saccharomyces cerevisiae , H2A . Z is introduced into chromatin by the SWR1 complex ( SWR1 . C ) , a multi-subunit ATP-dependent chromatin remodeler with the INO80-type ATPase SWR1 at its core ( Mizuguchi et al . , 2004; Ranjan et al . , 2013; Wang et al . , 2018a; Willhoft et al . , 2018; Wu et al . , 2005 ) . In humans , the two SWR1 orthologs EP400 and SRCAP may also be involved in H2A . Z incorporation ( Greenberg et al . , 2019; Pradhan et al . , 2016 ) . In\u00a0Drosophila\u00a0melanogaster , where H2A . Z is named H2A . V ( Baldi and Becker , 2013; van Daal and Elgin , 1992 ) , only one gene codes for a SWR1 ortholog: domino ( dom ) ( Ruhf et al . , 2001 ) . The first biochemical characterization revealed the presence of a multi-subunit complex composed of 15 proteins associated with the DOM ATPase ( Kusch et al . , 2004 ) . While many of the interactors identified are orthologous to the yeast SWR1 . C subunits , additional interactors were found . Surprisingly , they showed similarity to components of a distinct yeast complex , the Nucleosome Acetyltransferase of H4 ( NuA4 . C ) ( Kusch et al . , 2004 ) . NuA4 . C is a histone acetyltransferase ( HAT ) complex with the histone H4 N-terminal domain as a primary target ( Allard et al . , 1999; Doyon et al . , 2004; Wang et al . , 2018a; Xu et al . , 2016 ) . The DOM complex ( DOM . C ) appeared then to be a chimera , a fusion between two complexes with different biochemical activities . It has been proposed that both enzymatic activities of DOM . C , histone acetylation and histone variant exchange , are required for H2A . V turnover during DNA damage response ( Kusch et al . , 2004 ) . It is unclear , however , if this model of DOM . C action could be generalized to other processes , such as transcription regulation . Furthermore , it is still not known how H2A . V is incorporated globally into chromosomes while , at the same time , enriched at promoters . It is long known that the dom transcripts are alternatively spliced to generate two major isoforms , DOM-A and DOM-B ( Ruhf et al . , 2001 ) . We and others previously found that the two splice variants play non-redundant , essential roles during development with interesting phenotypic differences ( B\u00f6rner and Becker , 2016; Liu et al . , 2019 ) . In this work , we systematically characterized the molecular context and function of each DOM splice variant in D . melanogaster cell lines and assessed their contribution to the activity of the DOM . C in the context of transcription . We discovered the existence of two separate , isoform-specific complexes with characteristic composition . Both are involved in transcription regulation , but through different mechanisms . On the one hand , we found that the DOM-B . C is the main ATP-dependent remodeler for H2A . V , responsible for its deposition across the genome and specifically at active promoters . On the other hand , we discovered that DOM-A . C is not involved in bulk H2A . V incorporation , despite the presence of an ATPase domain and many shared subunits with DOM-B . C . Rather , we realized that DOM-A . C might be the \u2018missing\u2019 acetyltransferase NuA4 . C of D . melanogaster , which specifically targets lysine 12 of histone H4 ( H4K12 ) , the most abundant and yet uncharacterized H4 acetylation in flies ( Feller et al . , 2015 ) . Surprisingly , our data also suggest that the ATPase activity of DOM-A is dispensable for H4K12 acetylation by the DOM-A . C , a principle that might be conserved across metazoans . Our work illustrates how alternative splicing generates functional diversity amongst chromatin regulators . \n The isoforms of the DOMINO ATPase , DOM-A and DOM-B , are identical for the first 2008 amino acids , but alternative splicing diversifies their C-termini ( Figure 1A ) . Both proteins share an N-terminal HSA domain and a central , INO80-like ATPase domain . DOM-A has a longer C-terminus characterized by a SANT domain and a region rich in poly-glutamine stretches ( Q-rich ) . The shorter C-terminus of DOM-B , instead , folds in no predictable manner . Given these differences , we wondered if the interaction partners of the two isoforms might differ . To avoid artefactual association of DOM isoforms with proteins upon overexpression , we inserted a 3XFLAG tag within the endogenous dom gene in D . melanogaster embryonic cell lines using CRISPR/Cas9 . The sites were chosen such that either DOM-A ( DOM-RA ) or DOM-B ( DOM-RE ) would be tagged at their C-termini . Of note , the editing of DOM-A C-terminus results in the additional tagging of a longer , DOM-A-like isoform ( DOM-RG , which compared to DOM-RA has an insertion of 35 residues at its N-terminus starting from residue 401 ) , but leaves a second DOM-A-like isoform untagged ( DOM-RD , 16 residues shorter than DOM-RA at the very C-terminus ) . We obtained three different clonal cell lines for each isoform ( 3 homozygous clones for DOM-A , 2 homozygous and 1 heterozygous clone for DOM-B ) ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A , B ) . The dom gene editing resulted in the expression of 3XFLAG-tagged proteins of the correct size and with similar expression levels across clones ( Figure 1B ) . To identify the strongest and most stable interactors , we enriched the isoforms and associated proteins from nuclear extracts by FLAG-affinity chromatography under very stringent conditions . Mass-spectrometry analysis revealed 13 and 12 strongly enriched interactors ( FDR\u00a0<\u00a00 . 05 and log2 fold-change\u00a0>0 ) for DOM-A and DOM-B , respectively ( Figure 1C , Supplementary file 1 ) . Of those , 7 are common between the two isoforms and were previously characterized as DOM interactors ( Kusch et al . , 2004 ) . Two of the expected subunits , PONT and REPT , associated more strongly with DOM-B than with DOM-A under these conditions ( log2 DOM-A IP/CTRL\u00a0=\u00a01 . 19 and 1 . 16 , FDR\u00a0=\u00a00 . 373 and 0 . 338 ) . A newly identified DOM-B interactor , HCF , also interacts less strongly DOM-A ( log2 DOM-A IP/CTRL\u00a0=\u00a00 . 70 , FDR\u00a0=\u00a00 . 466 ) . The unique interactors revealed interesting differences between DOM-A and DOM-B ( Figure 1D ) . Three of the proteins that specifically associate with DOM-A [ING3 , E ( Pc ) and TIP60] share extensive homology with the acetyltransferase module of the yeast NuA4 complex . Another component of the yeast NuA4 . C , NIPPED-A , specifically associates with DOM-A . Additionally , we found two transcription factors , XBP1 and CG12054 , amongst the DOM-A specific interactors . On the DOM-B side , only ARP6 and PPS appear to\u00a0be\u00a0specific interactors of this isoform . While ARP6 was not described before in Drosophila , its yeast homolog is essential for H2A . Z remodeling by the SWR1 . C ( Wu et al . , 2005 ) . To validate the DOM-A/TIP60 interaction , we raised monoclonal antibodies against TIP60 . Co-immunoprecipitation confirmed that TIP60 interacts with DOM-A and not with DOM-B ( Figure 1E and Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C ) . The immunoprecipitation of DOM-A appears to be more efficient when probing with the anti-FLAG antibody compared to the anti-DOM-A polyclonal antibody . This difference might be explained by the presence of one of the DOM-A-like isoforms ( DOM-RD ) , which was left untagged . This isoform is therefore not immunoprecipitated by the anti-FLAG antibody , but it is recognized by the DOM-A specific antibody . Importantly , the same co-immunoprecipitation showed that DOM-A and DOM-B do not interact with each other under these conditions . Taken together , these findings document the existence of two distinct DOM complexes: DOM-A . C and DOM-B . C . Previous observation in flies suggested that DOM-A and DOM-B have different , non-redundant functions during Drosophila development ( B\u00f6rner and Becker , 2016; Ruhf et al . , 2001 ) . Isoform-specific depletion by RNA interference ( RNAi ) of either DOM variant in a Drosophila embryonic cell line did not lead to depletion of the other isoform ( Figure 2A ) . Interestingly , knock-down of DOM-A ( but not DOM-B ) led to a strong reduction of TIP60 protein levels . tip60 mRNA levels were unchanged ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A ) , indicating that TIP60 requires DOM-A for stability ( Figure 2A ) . This suggests that most of TIP60 resides in the DOM-A complex in Drosophila cells . The yeast SWR-1 and NuA4 complexes are both implicated in transcription ( Morillo-Huesca et al . , 2010; Searle et al . , 2017 ) . We therefore explored the functional differences of the two DOM isoforms on transcription by RNAseq . In our analysis , we also included knock-downs of H2A . V and TIP60 . Knock-down of either DOM-A , DOM-B , TIP60 or H2A . V individually resulted in significant perturbation of transcription , with notable differences ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B , Supplementary file 2 ) . Principal Components Analysis ( PCA ) revealed clearly different transcriptional responses upon loss of DOM-A or DOM-B ( Figure 2B ) , which can be visualized by comparing their log2 fold-changes relative to control ( Figure 2C ) . The correlation value of 0 . 45 indicates that many genes are regulated similarly by both ATPases , but a significant number of genes are also differentially affected upon specific depletion of either DOM-A or DOM-B ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B ) . As expected , the transcriptional effects of DOM-A knock-down , but not of DOM-B , resemble the ones caused by knock-down of TIP60 ( Figure 2B , D ) . Depletion of H2A . V led to a global reduction of transcription , only observable by normalization to spiked-in D . virilis RNA ( see methods ) ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C ) . The effects of H2A . V depletion were better correlated to DOM-B ( r\u00a0=\u00a00 . 51 ) than to DOM-A knock-down ( r\u00a0=\u00a00 . 25 ) ( Figure 2B , D ) . Many effects of DOM-B depletion may be explained by its H2A . V deposition function , but the ATPase also affects transcription through different routes . In summary , we found that the depletion of the two DOM isoforms in cells caused specific transcriptional perturbations . The partially overlapping responses upon DOM-B and H2A . V depletions motivated a more in-depth analysis of the relationship between DOM-B and H2A . V levels in the genome . Both SWR1-type ATPases , DOM-A and DOM-B may contribute to H2A . V incorporation and turnover . We explored global changes in H2A . V levels upon isoform-specific RNAi in nuclear extracts containing chromatin and soluble nuclear proteins . We found a strong H2A . V reduction upon DOM-B depletion ( Figure 3A , Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A ) , while H2A . V mRNA level was unchanged ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B ) . Among the interactors found in our mass-spectrometry analysis , only RNAi against the DOM-B . C-specific subunit ARP6 reduced H2A . V levels to a similar extent ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C , D ) . H2A . V was not affected by the knock-down of DOM-A , TIP60 or other DOM-A . C-specific subunits ( Figure 3A , Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A , C , D ) . While western blots reveal global changes , they are not sufficiently sensitive to detect changes of H2A . V occupancy at specific sites in chromatin . We therefore employed a more sensitive chromatin immunoprecipitation ( ChIP-seq ) approach , in which we included D . virilis spike-in cells to quantify global changes in H2A . V levels . As expected , we scored dramatic effects on H2A . V levels along the entire genome upon depletion of DOM-B , including promoters and transcriptional termination sites ( Figure 3B , C , Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1E ) . Depletion of DOM-A did not affect chromosomal H2A . V at any of these sites ( Figure 3B , C ) . These observations support the notion that the DOM-B . C , and not the DOM-A . C , is the remodeler dedicated to H2A . V incorporation . Since SWR1-type remodelers bind and hydrolyze ATP to incorporate H2A . Z variants ( Hong et al . , 2014; Willhoft et al . , 2018 ) , we wanted to confirm the ATP-requirement for in vivo incorporation of H2A . V by DOM-B . We devised an RNAi-based complementation strategy in which we rescued the effects of depleting endogenous dom-B mRNA by expression of RNAi-resistant dom-B transgenes . The functional complementation involved wild-type DOM-B or a mutant predicted to be deficient in ATP-binding ( K945G ) ( Hong et al . , 2014; Mizuguchi et al . , 2004; Figure 3D ) . GFP-tagging of the DOM-B proteins allowed to selectively monitor the H2A . V levels by immunofluorescence microscopy in the cells in which the transgenes are expressed . We detected higher levels of H2A . V in cells complemented with a wild-type DOM-B transgene , indicating the expected rescue ( Figure 3E ) . Conversely , the remodeling-defective mutant transgene did not increase the residual H2A . V levels ( Figure 3F ) . Comparing the mean H2A . V signal between cells that express the transgene ( GFP+ ) and cells that don\u2019t ( GFP- ) , revealed once more that only the wild-type could restore H2A . V levels ( Figure 3G , Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1F ) . The data suggest that the DOM-B . C is responsible for the incorporation of H2A . V in an ATP-dependent manner . Despite the presence of an ATPase domain identical to DOM-B , DOM-A does not seem to be responsible for H2A . V incorporation in steady state . Therefore , we considered other functions for DOM-A . C . The striking correlation between transcriptional responses upon TIP60 and DOM-A depletion suggests a unique association with functional relevance . Our mass-spectrometry analysis had identified several proteins that are homologous to corresponding subunits of the yeast NuA4 HAT complex . The core NuA4 . C subunit EAF1 is a small protein with prominent N-terminal HSA and C-terminal SANT domains . DOM-A also features similarly arranged domains , but they are separated by the long ATPase domain ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A ) . This raises the question whether DOM-A might serve as the central subunit of a NuA4-type complex in Drosophila . The existence of such a complex with functional and structural similarity to the well-studied yeast complex has not been reported so far . Since NuA4 . C is responsible for histone acetylation , we looked at H3 and H4 acetylation changes upon DOM isoform-specific knock-down by targeted mass-spectrometry . The hypothesis of a Drosophila NuA4 . C poses the acetyltransferase TIP60 as the main effector of DOM-A . C . This is supported by the earlier finding that TIP60 is unstable in the absence of DOM-A ( Figure 2A ) . We therefore included TIP60 knock-down for our targeted mass-spectrometry . Our analysis showed that RNAi against DOM-A , but not against DOM-B , specifically reduces H4K12ac ( average 28 . 9% reduction ) and , to a lesser extent , H4K5ac ( average 23 . 1% reduction ) ( Figure 4A , Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B ) . Importantly , unsupervised clustering shows that depleting DOM-A or TIP60 lead to very similar changes in histone acetylation patterns: depletion of TIP60 also reduces H4K12ac , by on average 36 . 3% and H4K5ac by 16 . 4% ( Figure 4A , Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B ) . Interestingly , we detected a decrease in monomethylation and increase of trimethylation at H3K27 by DOM depletion , a bit stronger for DOM-A or TIP60 ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1C , D ) . H4 methylation was unchanged ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1E ) . The H4K12 seems to be the most prominent chromatin target of the DOM-A/TIP60 complex . We sought to confirm the mass spectrometric result by an orthogonal ChIP-seq experiment . We found the H4K12ac signal reduced in many regions of the genome , including promoters and transcriptional termination sites , upon TIP60 RNAi and to a lesser extent upon DOM-A RNAi ( Figure 4B , C , Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1F , H , I ) , but the results suffer from variability , probably due to a low ChIP efficiency of the H4K12ac antibody ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1F ) . Comparison between H4K12ac and transcription showed that genes downregulated in DOM-A or TIP60 knock-down tend to have higher basal levels of H4K12ac at promoters ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1G ) . The reduction of H4K12ac by DOM-A or TIP60 knock-down , however , is global and does not affect some genes specifically ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1H ) . Remarkably , depletion of DOM-B caused an unexpected increase in H4K12 acetylation at many chromosomal regions that lose the mark upon DOM-A ablation ( Figure 4B , C ) . Depletion of H2A . V also causes a small H4K12ac increase similarly to DOM-B knock-down , as if the absence of this remodeler and/or its substrate allowed more DOM-A activity at promoters . The yeast NuA4 . C does not contain a functional ATPase at its core . To explore whether the acetylation of H4K12 catalyzed by the DOM-A . C depends on ATP-dependent nucleosome remodeling activity , we employed the same RNAi-based complementation strategy we had used for DOM-B ( Figure 3D ) . DOM-A was depleted and RNAi-resistant DOM-A wild-type or ATPase mutant derivatives were tested for their ability to rescue the loss of H4K12ac . As expected , the wild-type DOM-A transgene restored H4K12 acetylation ( Figure 4D ) . Remarkably , this acetylation did not depend on a functional DOM-A ATPase . Comparison of the mean H4K12ac signals in cells that do or do not express the transgene confirmed that both , the wild-type and the mutant transgenes , could restore H4K12ac levels ( Figure 4E , Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1J ) . \n Our mass-spectrometry analysis of endogenously expressed DOM isoforms purified under stringent conditions revealed two separate complexes . A DOM . C was previously reported after overexpression and affinity-purification of tagged PONTIN ( Kusch et al . , 2004 ) , which yielded a mixture of DOM-A and DOM-B complexes and may be contaminated with the dINO80 complex , which also contains PONTIN ( Klymenko et al . , 2006 ) . In light of our results , we think the model for H2A . V exchange during DNA damage response proposed in this early work ( Kusch et al . , 2004 ) should be re-visited accounting for the contribution of both DOM-A . C , DOM-B . C and possibly dINO80 . C . It will be interesting to define the role of each complex on the recognition and restoration of damaged chromatin , especially at the level of H2A . V remodeling and acetylation-based signaling . We previously showed that DOM-B , and not DOM-A or TIP60 , affects H2A . V levels during fly oogenesis ( B\u00f6rner and Becker , 2016 ) . In addition to confirming this finding in a different system and with complementary experimental approaches , we now also showed that the DOM-B . C is responsible for H2A . V incorporation into chromatin . The reaction requires ATP , like SWR1 . C-mediated H2A . Z incorporation . We also discovered a previously unidentified subunit , ARP6 , which is necessary for the maintenance of H2A . V global levels , just like DOM-B . In yeast SWR1 . C and human SRCAP . C , the ARP6 orthologs are indispensable for nucleosome remodeling since they couple the ATPase motor to productive nucleosome sliding ( Matsuda et al . , 2010; Willhoft et al . , 2018; Willhoft and Wigley , 2020; Wu et al . , 2005 ) . The Drosophila DOM-B . C is likely to employ a similar remodeling mechanism . Knock-down of DOM-B affects transcription , but the effects overlap only partially with those that follow H2A . V depletion . This discrepancy could be explained in several ways . First , the reduction of H2A . V levels upon DOM-B knock-down is not as extensive as the one caused by direct depletion of H2A . V . The residual levels of H2A . V upon DOM-B depletion may suffice to regulate transcription at many promoters . Second , we cannot exclude that DOM-B . C also impacts transcription independently of H2A . V incorporation . Third , the global increase of H4K12ac at promoters upon DOM-B knock-down might indirectly compensate for the loss of H2A . V at some specific genes . The DOM-A . C , surprisingly , did not affect H2A . V incorporation under physiological conditions in any of our assays , in agreement with what has been observed for the DOM-A isoform during oogenesis ( B\u00f6rner and Becker , 2016 ) . DOM-A . C lacks the ARP6 subunit that is a mechanistic requirement for nucleosome remodeling by INO80-type remodelers ( Willhoft and Wigley , 2020 ) . Because the ATPase domain of DOM-A is identical to the one in DOM-B , it is possible that DOM-A utilizes ATP under circumstances that we did not monitor in our study . It is also possible that DOM-A . C-specific subunits have an inhibitory effect on DOM-A ATPase activity through allosteric regulation . Of note , the recombinant human ortholog of DOM-A , EP400 , can incorporate H2A . Z ( Park et al . , 2010 ) , but H2A . Z levels are unaffected if EP400 is depleted in vivo , where it resides in a multi-subunit complex ( Pradhan et al . , 2016 ) . Regulation of nucleosome remodeling through autoinhibitory domains or associated subunits is a widespread mechanism ( Clapier et al . , 2017 ) . Our data suggest that the DOM-A . C is the functional equivalent of the yeast NuA4 . C , which acetylates the H4 N-terminus ( Kuo et al . , 2015 ) and possibly other proteins . Depletion of DOM-A . C causes a significant reduction of H4K12ac at a global level . Some genomic regions that still retain a high H4K12ac ChIP signal in the absence of DOM-A may be explained by the presence of additional acetyltransferases targeting H4K12 , such as CHAMEAU ( Feller et al . , 2015; Peleg et al . , 2016 ) . The function of H4K12ac is still largely unknown in Drosophila , although it has been implicated in aging ( Peleg et al . , 2016 ) . We speculate that H4K12ac may participate in transcriptional regulation since knock-down of DOM-A or TIP60 perturb the transcriptional program in a very similar manner . Genes down-regulated upon DOM-A and TIP60 RNAi show high H4K12ac around their TSS , but the H4K12ac is not specifically reduced at their promoters . We speculate that these genes might rely more on H4K12ac for their expression or be more sensitive to changes in acetylation . Given that H4K12ac is the most abundant H4 acetylation ( Feller et al . , 2015; Peleg et al . , 2016 ) , we also cannot exclude that some of these effects are due to global and aberrant chromosomal condensation . The increase in H4K12ac at promoter observed upon DOM-B RNAi appears to be partially phenocopied by the knock-down of H2A . V . It is possible that H2A-containing nucleosomes are a better substrate for the DOM-A . C compared to the ones containing only H2A . V . The loss of the variant might therefore result in higher H4K12ac catalyzed by TIP60 . In the absence of DOM-A , TIP60 is unstable suggesting that the DOM-A . C is the major form of TIP60 , at least in D . melanogaster cells . It also suggests that during evolution a HAT module and some components of the SWR1 . C became stably associated in a new functional complex , the dNuA4 . C , as it\u00a0has been proposed for the human EP400 complex ( Auger et al . , 2008 ) . An intermediate case is found in C . albicans , where acetylation of EAF1 by TIP60 mediates a reversible association between the NuA4 . C and SWR1 . C ( Wang et al . , 2018b ) . We found that the DOM-A . C H4K12 HAT activity does not need the DOM-A ATPase activity . In yeast , inserting the ATPase domain of the Drosophila DOM between the HSA and SANT domains of EAF1 , the central subunit of the yeast NuA4 , does not affect its function ( Auger et al . , 2008 ) . Such a situation could also apply to DOM-A . Lastly , our mass-spectrometry analysis revealed new , uncharacterized interactors for DOM-A . Of those , the transcription factor CG12054 has been found as a potential DOM partner in a previous screen ( Rhee et al . , 2014 ) . Its human ortholog , JAZF1 , appears to be involved in transcriptional repression ( Nakajima et al . , 2004 ) and has been associated to endometrial stromal tumors ( Koontz et al . , 2001 ) . Its function in flies is unknown . Division of labor between chromatin modifying enzymes is key to ensure efficient regulation of nuclear processes . During evolution , genome duplications and genetic divergence expand and diversify activities . The case of DOM illustrates beautifully how evolution can take different routes to achieve what must be assumed as an important functional specification ( Figure 4F , Supplementary file 3 ) . In yeast , the SWR1 and NuA4 complexes are entirely separate entities . In humans , whose genomes underwent duplication events , the paralogous SRCAP and EP400 protein ATPases each organize different complexes that may serve distinct , conserved functions . In Drosophila a similar specialization was achieved by alternative splicing . Surprisingly , the gene orthologs of dom in honeybee ( A . mellifera , LOC413341 ) , jewel wasp ( N . vitripennis , LOC100115939 ) , Jerdon\u2019s jumpin ant ( H . saltator , LOC105183375 ) , red flour beetle ( T . castaneum , LOC656538 ) and even in the common house spider ( P . tepidariorum , LOC107448208 ) undergo alternative splicing to generate at least two isoforms with different C-termini . The mode of specification of SWR1 and NuA4 through splice variants might therefore not be limited to Drosophila , but more wide-spread throughout the Arthropoda phylum . \n D . melanogaster embryonic Kc167 cell line was obtained from the\u00a0Drosophila\u00a0Genomic Resource Center ( https://dgrc . bio . indiana . edu/Home ) . D . melanogaster S2 ( subclone L2-4 ) cell line was a kind gift of P Heun ( Villa et al . , 2016 ) . D . virilis 79f7Dv3 cell line was a kind gift of BV Adrianov ( Albig et al . , 2019 ) . The identity of cell lines was verified by high-throughput sequencing . Cells were subjected to mycoplasma testing . Cells were maintained at 26\u00b0C in Schneider\u2019s Drosophila Medium ( Thermo-Fischer , Cat . No 21720024 ) supplemented with 10% FBS ( Kc167 and S2 ) or 5% FBS ( 79f7Dv3 ) and 1% Penicillin-Streptomycin solution ( Sigma-Aldrich , Cat No P-4333 ) . gRNAs targeting exon 14 ( DOM-A and DOM-G , Flybase transcripts dom-RA and dom-RG ) or exon 11 ( DOM-B , Flybase transcript dom-RE ) were initially designed using GPP sgRNA designer ( https://portals . broadinstitute . org/gpp/public/analysis-tools/sgrna-design; Doench et al . , 2016 ) . gRNA candidates were checked for off-targets using flyCRISPR Target Finder ( https://flycrispr . org/target-finder/ , guide length\u00a0=\u00a020 , Stringency\u00a0=\u00a0high , PAM\u00a0=\u00a0NGG only ) ( Gratz et al . , 2014 ) . Two gRNAs each for DOM-A and DOM-B were selected ( Supplementary file 4 ) . The 20 bp gRNAs were fused to a tracrRNA backbone during synthesis and cloned downstream of the Drosophila U6 promoter . These constructs were synthesized as gBlocks ( Integrated DNA Technologies ) and PCR-amplified before transfection using Q5 polymerase ( New England Biolabs , Cat No . M0491S ) . To generate the repair template , the sequence encoding for 3XFLAG tag , including a stop codon , was inserted between two homology arms of 200 bp each by gene synthesis ( Integrated DNA Technologies ) ( Supplementary file 4 ) . The repair templates were cloned in pUC19 to generate repair plasmids . For CRISPR editing , one million S2 cells ( subclone L2-4 ) in 500 \u00b5L medium were seeded in each well of a 24-well plate . After 4 hr , cells were transfected with 110 ng of gRNAs ( 55 ng each ) , 200 ng of repair plasmid and 190 ng of pIB_Cas9_Blast ( encoding SpCas9 and carrying Blasticidin resistance , kind gift of P Heun ) using X-tremeGENE HP DNA Transfection Reagent ( Roche , Cat . No 6366236001 ) . 24 hr after transfection , medium was replaced with 500 \u00b5L of fresh medium containing 25 \u00b5g/ml Blasticidin ( Gibco , Cat . No A1113903 ) . Three days after selection the cells were collected and seeded into 6 cm tissue culture dishes at three different concentrations ( 1000 , 2000 and 5000 cells/well ) and allowed to attach for 1\u20132 hr . Medium was then removed and cells carefully overlaid with 2 . 5 mL of a 1:1 mix of 2X Schneider\u2019s Medium ( prepared from powder , Serva , Cat . No 35500 ) + 20% FBS + 2% Penicillin-Streptomycin and 0 . 4% low-melting agarose equilibrated to 37\u00b0C . The dishes were sealed with parafilm , inserted into 15 cm dishes together with a piece of damp paper and sealed once more with parafilm . After 2 to 3 weeks , individual cell colonies were picked using a pipet , suspended in 100 \u00b5L of Schneider\u2019s Drosophila Medium + 10% FBS + 1% Penicillin-Streptomycin and plated into 96-well plates . Clones were expanded for 1\u20132 weeks and further expanded into 48-well plates . For PCR-testing of clones , 50 \u00b5L of cells were collected , 50 \u00b5L water was added and DNA was purified using Nucleospin Gel and PCR Cleanup ( Macherey-Nagel , Cat . No 740609 . 250 ) . Extracted DNA was PCR-amplified to check the insertion of the 3XFLAG tag . The PCR product of DOM-A clone #2 results larger due to the presence of an insertion 29 bp downstream of the stop codon ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B ) . Selected clones were further expanded and stored in liquid nitrogen in 90% FBS + 10% DMSO . For nuclear extraction from 3XFLAG-tagged cells lines , 0 . 5\u20131 billion cells were collected by centrifugation at 500 g for 5 min . Cells were washed with 10 ml of PBS , resuspended in 10 ml of ice-cold NBT-10 buffer [15 mM HEPES pH 7 . 5 , 15 mM NaCl , 60 mM KCl , 0 . 5 mM EGTA pH 8 , 10% Sucrose , 0 . 15% Triton-X-100 , 1 mM PMSF , 0 . 1 mM DTT , 1X cOmplete EDTA-free Protease Inhibitor ( Roche , Cat . No 5056489001 ) ] and rotated for 10 min at 4\u00b0C . Lysed cells were gently overlaid on 20 ml of ice-cold NB-1 . 2 buffer ( 15 mM HEPES pH 7 . 5 , 15 mM NaCl , 60 mM KCl , 0 . 5 mM EGTA pH 8 , 1 . 2 M Sucrose , 1 mM PMSF , 0 . 1 mM DTT , 1X cOmplete EDTA-free Protease Inhibitor ) and spun at 4000 g for 15 min . Pelleted nuclei were washed once with 10 ml of ice-cold NB-10 buffer ( 15 mM HEPES pH 7 . 5 , 15 mM NaCl , 60 mM KCl , 0 . 5 mM EGTA pH 8 , 10% Sucrose , 1 mM PMSF , 0 . 1 mM DTT , 1X cOmplete EDTA-free Protease Inhibitor ) and resuspended in ice-cold Protein-RIPA buffer ( 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7 . 5 , 150 mM NaCl , 1 mM EDTA , 0 . 5% IGEPAL CA-630 , 0 . 5% Na-Deoxycholate , 0 . 1% SDS , 1 mM PMSF , 0 . 1 mM DTT , 1X cOmplete EDTA-free Protease Inhibitor ) . Nuclei were sonicated in 15 mL Falcons tubes using Diagenode Bioruptor ( 20 cycles , 30 s ON/30 s OFF ) . Extract was spun at 16000 g for 15 min at 4\u00b0C in a table-top centrifuge . Soluble extract was collected and total protein concentration determined using Protein Assay Dye Reagent Concentrate ( BIO-RAD , Cat No 5000006 ) with BSA as standard . 2 mg aliquots were flash-frozen . For FLAG-immunoprecipitation , 2 mg of nuclear protein were thawed , spun at 160 , 000 g for 15 min at 4\u00b0C to remove aggregates . Extracts were diluted 1:1 with Benzonase dilution buffer ( 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7 . 5 , 150 mM NaCl , 4 mM MgCl2 , 0 . 5% NP-40 , 1 mM PMSF , 0 . 1 mM DTT , 1X cOmplete EDTA-free Protease Inhibitor ) . 60 \u00b5L ( 50% slurry ) of Protein-RIPA-equilibrated FLAG-m2 beads ( Sigma-Aldrich , Cat . No A2220 ) were added together with 1 \u00b5L of Benzonase ( Merck-Millipore , Cat . No 1 . 01654 . 0001 ) . After 3 hr of incubation at 4\u00b0C on a rotating wheel , the beads were washed 3 times with ice-cold Protein-RIPA buffer and thrice with ice-cold TBS ( 5 mM Tris-HCl pH 7 . 5 , 150 mM NaCl ) ( 5 min rotation each , 4\u00b0C ) . For western blots , beads were then resuspended in 50 \u00b5L of 5X Laemmli Sample buffer ( 250 mM Tris-HCl pH 6 . 8 , 10% w/v SDS , 50% v/v glycerol , 0 . 1% w/v bromophenol blue , 10% \u03b2-mercaptoethanol ) and boiled for 5 min at 95\u00b0C . For mass-spectrometry , beads were incubated with 50 \u00b5L of elution buffer ( 2 M urea , 50 mM Tris-HCl , pH 7 . 5 , 2 mM DTT and 10 \u00b5g ml\u20131 trypsin ) for 30 min at 37\u00b0C . The eluate was removed and beads were incubated in 50 \u00b5L of alkylation buffer ( 2 M urea , 50 mM Tris-HCl , pH 7 . 5 and 10 mM chloroacetamide ) at 37\u00b0C for 5 min . Combined eluates were further incubated overnight at room temperature . Tryptic-peptide mixtures were acidified with 1% Trifluoroacetic acid ( TFA ) and desalted with Stage Tips containing three layers of SDB-RPS ( Polystyrene-divinylbenzene copolymer partially modified with sulfonic acid ) material . To this end , samples were mixed 1:1 with 1% TFA in isopropanol and loaded onto the stagetip . After two washes with 100 \u00b5L 1%TFA in Isopropanol and two washes with 100 \u00b5l 0 . 2%TFA in water , samples were eluted with 80 \u00b5l of 2% ( v/v ) ammonium hydroxide , 80% ( v/v ) acetonitrile ( ACN ) and dried on a centrifugal evaporator . Samples were dissolved in 10 \u00b5L Buffer A* ( 2% ACN/0 . 1% TFA ) for mass spectrometry . Peptides were separated on 50\u2010cm columns packed in house with ReproSil\u2010Pur C18\u2010AQ 1 . 9 \u03bcm resin ( Dr Maisch ) . Liquid chromatography was performed on an EASY\u2010nLC 1200 ultra\u2010high\u2010pressure system coupled through a nanoelectrospray source to a Q-Exactive HF-X mass spectrometer ( Thermo Fisher ) . Peptides were loaded in buffer A ( 0 . 1% formic acid ) and separated by application of a non-linear gradient of 5\u201330% buffer B ( 0 . 1% formic acid , 80% ACN ) at a flow rate of 300 nl min\u20131 over 70 min . Data acquisition switched between a full scan and 10 data\u2010dependent MS/MS scans . Full scans were acquired with target values of 3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0106 charges in the 300\u20131 , 650 m/z range . The resolution for full-scan MS spectra was set to 60 , 000 with a maximum injection time of 20 ms . The 10 most abundant ions were sequentially isolated with an ion target value of 1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0105 and an isolation window of 1 . 4 m/z . Fragmentation of precursor ions was performed by higher energy C-trap dissociation with a normalized collision energy of 27 eV . Resolution for HCD spectra was set to 15 , 000 with a maximum ion-injection time of 60 ms . Multiple sequencing of peptides was minimized by excluding the selected peptide candidates for 30 s . In total , 3 technical replicates ( parallel immunoprecipitations ) for each of the 3 biological replicates ( 1 clone\u00a0=\u00a01 replicate , extract prepared on different days ) were analyzed . Raw mass spectrometry data were analyzed with MaxQuant ( version 1 . 5 . 6 . 7 ) ( Cox and Mann , 2008 ) and Perseus ( version 1 . 5 . 4 . 2 ) software packages . Peak lists were searched against the Drosophila melanogaster UniProt FASTA database combined with 262 common contaminants by the integrated Andromeda search engine ( Cox et al . , 2011 ) . The false discovery rate ( FDR ) was set to 1% for both peptides ( minimum length of 7 amino acids ) and proteins . \u2018Match between runs\u2019 ( MBR ) with a maximum time difference of 0 . 7 min was enabled . Relative protein amounts were determined with the MaxLFQ algorithm ( Cox et al . , 2014 ) , with a minimum ratio count of two . Missing values were imputed from a normal distribution , by applying a width of 0 . 2 and a downshift of 1 . 8 standard deviations . Imputed LFQ values of the technical replicates for each biological replicate were averaged . Differential enrichment analysis was performed in R using the limma package as previously described ( Kammers et al . , 2015; Ritchie et al . , 2015 ) . Adjusted p-values ( FDR ) were calculated using the p . adjust function ( method = \u2018fdr\u2019 ) ( Source code 1 ) . Primers for dsRNA templates were either obtained from the TRiP website ( https://fgr . hms . harvard . edu/fly-in-vivo-rnai ) , designed using SnapDragon ( https://www . flyrnai . org/snapdragon ) or designed using E-RNAi ( https://www . dkfz . de/signaling/e-rnai3/ ) ( Horn and Boutros , 2010; Perkins et al . , 2015 ) , except one primer pair for Tip60 RNAi which was obtained from Kusch et al . ( 2004 ) ( Supplementary file 4 ) . Templates for in vitro transcription were generated by PCR-amplification using Q5 Polymerase ( New England Biolabs , Cat No . M0491S ) . dsRNAs were generated by in vitro transcription using MEGAScript T7 kit ( Invitrogen , Cat . No AMB 13345 ) , followed by incubation at 85\u00b0C for 5 min and slow cool-down to room temperature . D . melanogaster Kc167 cell were collected by spinning at 500 g for 5 min . Cells were washed once with PBS and resuspended in Schneider\u2019s\u00a0Drosophila\u00a0Medium without serum and Penicillin-Streptomycin at a concentration of 1 . 5 million/ml ( for RNAi in 12-well and 6-well plates ) or 3 million/ml ( for RNAi in T-75 flasks ) . 0 . 75 million ( 12-well ) , 1 . 5 million ( 6-well ) or 15 million ( T-75 flasks ) cells were plated and 5 \u00b5g ( 12-well ) , 10 ug ( 6-well ) or 50 \u00b5g ( T-75 flasks ) of dsRNA was added . Cells were incubated for 1 hr with gentle rocking and 3 volumes of Schneider\u2019s\u00a0Drosophila\u00a0Medium ( supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% Penicillin-Streptomycin solution ) was added . After 6 days cells were collected and analyzed . Two million of Kc167 cells were pelleted at 500 g for 5 min . Cells were resuspended in 1 mL of PBS and 1 million of D . virilis 79f7Dv3 cells were added . Cells were pelleted at 500 g for 5 min and total RNA was extracted using RNeasy Mini Kit ( QIAgen , Cat No . 74104 ) , including DNAse digestion step ( QIAgen , Cat No . 79254 ) . mRNA was purified using Poly ( A ) RNA selection kit ( Lexogen , Cat . No M039100 ) . Both total RNA and mRNA quality was verified on a 2100 Bioanalyzer ( Agilent Technologies , Cat . No G2939BA ) . Libraries for sequencing were prepared using NEBnext Ultra II directional RNA library prep kit for Illumina ( New England Biolabs , Cat . No E7760L ) . Libraries were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 1500 instrument at the Laboratory of Functional Genomic Analysis ( LAFUGA , Gene Center Munich , LMU ) . For the analysis , 50 bp single reads were mapped to the D . melanogaster ( release 6 ) or independently to the D . virilis ( release 1 ) genome using STAR ( version 2 . 5 . 3a ) with the GTF annotation dmel-all-r6 . 17 . gtf or dvir-all-r1 . 07 . gtf , respectively . Multi-mapping reads were filtered out by the parameter --outFilterMultimapNmax 1 . Genic reads were counted with the parameter --quantMode GeneCounts . Read count tables were imported to R and low count genes were removed ( at least 1 read per gene in 6 of the samples ) . Normalization factors ( sizeFactors ) were calculated for D . melanogaster or D . virilis count tables independently using DESeq2 package ( version 1 . 24 ) . Normalization factors derived from D . virilis were applied to D . melanogaster counts . Statistical analysis was carried out using DESeq2 by providing replicate information as batch covariate . Estimated log2 fold-change and adjusted p-values were obtained by the results function ( DESeq2 ) and adjusted p-value threshold was set 0 . 01 . Batch effect was corrected by the ComBat function from the sva package ( version 3 . 32 ) on the log2-transformed normalized read counts . Batch adjusted counts were plotted relative to control or used for principal component analysis ( PCA ) . Plots were generated using R graphics . Scripts are available on GitHub ( https://github . com/tschauer/Domino_RNAseq_2020 ) . cDNA was synthesized from 1 \u00b5g of total RNA ( extracted as previously described but omitting the addition of D . virilis spike-in cells ) using Superscript III First Strand Synthesis System ( Invitrogen , Cat .

For nuclear fractionation , 5\u201310 million cells were pelleted at 500 g for 5 min and washed with PBS . Cell pellets were either used directly or flash-frozen for later processing . Pellets were suspended in 300 \u00b5L of ice-cold NBT-10 buffer and rotated for 10 min at 4\u00b0C . Lysed cells were gently overlaid on 500 \u00b5L of ice-cold NB-1 . 2 buffer and spun at 5000 g for 20 min . Pelleted nuclei were washed once with 500 \u00b5L of ice-cold NB-10 buffer . Nuclei were resuspended in 60 \u00b5L of 1:1 mix of Protein-RIPA buffer and 5X Laemmli Sample buffer . Samples were boiled for 5 min at 95\u00b0C and ran on pre-cast 8% or 14% polyacrylamide gels ( Serva , Cat . No 43260 . 01 and 43269 . 01 ) under denaturing conditions in 1X Running Buffer ( 25 mM Tris , 192 mM glycine , 0 . 1% SDS ) . Gels were wet-transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes ( GE Healthcare Life Sciences , Cat . No 10600002 ) in ice-cold 1X Transfer Buffer ( 25 mM Tris , 192 mM glycine ) with 20% methanol ( for histones ) or with 10% methanol + 0 . 1% SDS ( for DOM proteins ) at 400 mA for 45\u201360 min . Membranes were blocked with 5% BSA in TBS buffer for 1 hr and incubated with primary antibodies in TBST buffer ( TBS + 0 . 1% Tween-20 ) + 5% non-fat milk at 4\u00b0C overnight . Membrane were washed 3 times ( 5 min each ) with TBST buffer and incubated with secondary antibodies in TBST buffer for 1 hr at room temperature . Membrane were washed 3 times with TBST buffer , 2 times with TBS buffer ( 5 min each ) , and dried before imaging . Images were taken on a LI-COR Odyssey or a LI-COR Odyssey CLx machine ( LI-COR Biosciences ) . 70 to 130 million D . melanogaster Kc167 cells , resuspended in 20 ml of complete Schneider\u2019s\u00a0Drosophila\u00a0Medium , were crosslinked by adding 1:10 of the volume of Fixing Solution ( 100 mM NaCl , 50 mM Hepes pH 8 , 1 mM EDTA , 0 . 5 mM EGTA , 10% methanol-free formaldehyde ) and rotated at room temperature for 8 min . 1 . 17 ml of freshly-prepared 2 . 5 M glycine was added to stop the fixation ( final conc . 125 mM ) . Cells were pelleted at 500 g for 10 min ( 4\u00b0C ) and resuspended in 10 mL of ice-cold PBS . 3 . 5 million of fixed D . virilis cells ( fixed as described for D . melanogaster cells ) were added for every 70 million D . melanogaster cells . Cells were pelleted at 526 g for 10 min ( 4\u00b0C ) and resuspended in 1 ml of PBS + 0 . 5% Triton-X-100 + 1X cOmplete EDTA-free Protease Inhibitor for every 70 million D . melanogaster cells and rotated at 4\u00b0C for 15 min to release nuclei .

{"lay_summary": "Motor nerves are like electrical wires that connect our spinal cord to the muscles in our body . These nerves communicate with muscles across a connection called the neuromuscular junction . To first form a neuromuscular junction , the motor nerves and muscles each produce molecular cues that tell each other to do their part to build a connection . Beta-catenin in the muscle is known to regulate motor nerve development . However , beta-catenin has two different roles: it helps to coordinate whether neighboring cells stick together , and it can regulate which genes are \u2018transcribed\u2019 to produce proteins . It was not known which of these roles is necessary for forming neuromuscular junctions . Wu , Barik et al . now investigate this question by creating mice with mutant forms of beta-catenin in their muscles . Some mice had muscle beta-catenin that could not help cells stick together , and others had beta-catenin that could not control gene transcription . Only mutations that affected the ability of beta-catenin to control transcription caused abnormalities in the neuromuscular junction . However , these problems could be fixed by adding either normal beta-catenin or the mutant form that cannot help cells stick together . Wu , Barik et al . then used molecular tools to explore which genes are turned on by beta-catenin . The experiments showed that beta-catenin causes muscle fibers to produce a protein called Slit2\u2014a developmental cue that controls where neurons grow . Furthermore , the neuromuscular junction defects found in mice without beta-catenin in their muscles could be reduced by making the muscle fibers produce more Slit2 . However , not all defects in beta-catenin mutant mice are rescued by Slit2 . Future research is needed to identify other beta-catenin-controlled signals and to determine whether such a pathway is altered in neuromuscular disorders .", "article": "Neuromuscular junction formation requires proper interaction between motoneurons and muscle cells . \u03b2-Catenin ( Ctnnb1 ) in muscle is critical for motoneuron differentiation; however , little is known about the relevant retrograde signal . In this paper , we dissected which functions of muscle Ctnnb1 are critical by an in vivo transgenic approach . We show that Ctnnb1 mutant without the transactivation domain was unable to rescue presynaptic deficits of Ctnnb1 mutation , indicating the involvement of transcription regulation . On the other hand , the cell-adhesion function of Ctnnb1 is dispensable . We screened for proteins that may serve as a Ctnnb1-directed retrograde factor and identified Slit2 . Transgenic expression of Slit2 specifically in the muscle was able to diminish presynaptic deficits by Ctnnb1 mutation in mice . Slit2 immobilized on beads was able to induce synaptophysin puncta in axons of spinal cord explants . Together , these observations suggest that Slit2 serves as a factor utilized by muscle Ctnnb1 to direct presynaptic differentiation . \n The neuromuscular junction ( NMJ ) is a cholinergic synapse that rapidly conveys signals from motoneurons to muscle cells to control muscle contraction . It exhibits a high degree of subcellular specialization characteristic of chemical synapses and has served as a model to study synaptogenesis ( Sanes and Lichtman , 2001; Wu et al . , 2010; Barik et al . , 2014b ) . Abnormal NMJ formation or function causes neurological disorders including congenital myasthenic syndrome and myasthenia gravis . NMJ formation requires reciprocal interactions between nerve terminals and muscle cells . In anterograde signaling , nerve-derived agrin directs post-synaptic differentiation by interacting with muscle transmembrane receptors LRP4 and MuSK , which in turn activate downstream signaling events leading to AChR concentration at the NMJ ( McMahan , 1990; DeChiara et al . , 1996; Glass et al . , 1996; Weatherbee et al . , 2006; Kim et al . , 2008; Zhang et al . , 2008 ) . However , much less is known regarding retrograde mechanisms that control motor neuron survival and presynaptic differentiation . Wnt signaling has been implicated in NMJ formation in Caenorhabditis elegans , Drosophila as well as vertebrates ( Korkut and Budnik , 2009; Zhang et al . , 2009; Barik et al . , 2014b ) . \u03b2-Catenin ( Ctnnb1 ) is a central component of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway , regulating transcription by associating with TCF/LEF transcription factors ( MacDonald et al . , 2009 ) . It also regulates adhesion-dependent signaling by binding to cadherins and \u03b1-catenin ( Nelson and Nusse , 2004 ) . Intriguingly , when Ctnnb1 is mutated in muscle fibers , mutant mice die neonatally , with profound presynaptic deficits such as mislocation of phrenic nerve primary branches , reduced synaptic vesicles , and impaired neuromuscular transmission ( Li et al . , 2008 ) , suggesting that Ctnnb1 in muscle cells is necessary for presynaptic differentiation . In support of this notion are recent reports that expression of stable Ctnnb1 in muscle cells also impairs presynaptic differentiation in mutant mice ( Liu et al . , 2012; Wu et al . , 2012a ) . These observations suggest that Ctnnb1 in muscle is critical for a retrograde pathway to direct nerve terminal development . However , the underlying mechanism remains unclear . The interaction of cadherins of pre- and post-synaptic membranes has been shown to be important for synapse formation ( Bamji et al . , 2003; Bozdagi et al . , 2004; Prakash et al . , 2005 ) and synaptic plasticity ( Murase et al . , 2002; Schuman and Murase , 2003; Nuriya and Huganir , 2006 ) . NMDAR stimulation accumulates Ctnnb1 in spines , which in turn regulates induced endocytosis of N-cadherins ( Tai et al . , 2007 ) . These observations raise questions whether the muscle Ctnnb1 regulates presynaptic differentiation via cell adhesion-dependent signaling and/or gene-expression . In this paper , we determined which function of Ctnnb1 is required for NMJ formation by characterizing transgenic mice expressing wild-type or Ctnnb1 mutants that were impaired in transcriptional regulation or cell-adhesion signaling . Rescue experiments indicated a necessary role for the transcription activity of muscle Ctnnb1 in presynaptic differentiation . Our exploration of targets of Ctnnb1 as potential muscle-derived retrograde factors led to the identification of Slit2 , an environmental cue that repels or collapses neuronal axons ( Brose et al . , 1999; Kidd et al . , 1999 ) . Slit2 belongs to a family of large ECM ( extracellular matrix ) glycoproteins known to be chemorepellent for olfactory , motor , hippocampal , and retinal axons ( Nguyen Ba-Charvet et al . , 1999; Erskine et al . , 2000; Niclou et al . , 2000; Ringstedt et al . , 2000 ) . However , Slit2 was also shown to stimulate the formation of axon collateral branches by dorsal root ganglia neurons ( Wang et al . , 1999 ) and positively regulate motor axon fasciculation ( Jaworski and Tessier-Lavigne , 2012 ) . Slit2 was able to induce clusters of synaptophysin in cultured neurons , suggesting a synaptogenic function . Expression of Slit2 specifically in muscle fibers was able to rescue NMJ deficits in Ctnnb1-mutant mice . These observations demonstrate that Ctnnb1 regulates presynaptic differentiation by a transcription-dependent mechanism and identify Slit2 as a novel retrograde factor in NMJ formation . \n The N-terminal region of Ctnnb1 interacts with \u03b1-catenin , critical for cell adhesion . The key amino acid residues in Ctnnb1 for interaction with \u03b1-catenin have been mapped to Thr-120 and Val-122 ( Aberle et al . , 1996a , 1996b ) . Mutation of these two residues to alanines prevents Ctnnb1 from binding to \u03b1-catenin ( Xu et al . , 2000 ) . However , the mutation has no effect on binding to TCF/Lef1 , and thus , does not alter the transcription by Ctnnb1 and TCF/Lef1 ( Xu et al . , 2000 ) . On the other hand , the transcriptional regulation requires the transactivation domain ( TAD ) ( Molenaar et al . , 1996; van de Wetering et al . , 1997; Vleminckx et al . , 1999 ) . To determine which function of Ctnnb1 is necessary , we generated transgenic mice: Ctnnb1TV-AA ( LSL-Ctnnb1TV-AA ) to impair the cell-adhesion function and TAD-deleted Ctnnb1 ( LSL-Ctnnb1\u0394TAD ) to eliminate the transcriptional regulation , as well as wild-type LSL-Ctnnb1 . Each transgene was placed downstream of a loxP-flanked transcriptional STOP ( LSL ) and contained the lacZ/neomycin fusion gene and triple repeats of the SV40 polyadenylation signal ( Zinyk et al . , 1998 ) . Expression of the transgenes , which were tagged by an HA epitope in the C-terminus , was under the control of the CAG promoter ( the CMV enhancer/chicken \u03b2-actin promoter ) and depended on expression of a Cre recombinase ( Zinyk et al . , 1998 ) ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A , B ) . In HEK293 cells , co-expression of GFP-Cre , which floxed out the stop element , led to expression of Ctnnb1 , Ctnnb1TV-AA , and Ctnnb1\u0394TAD that could be detected by both anti-HA and anti-Ctnnb1 antibodies ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C ) . To determine whether Ctnnb1 and mutants were expressed in skeletal muscles , the transgenic mice were crossed with ACTA1-Cre mice that express the Cre recombinase specifically in skeletal muscles under the control of the promoter of the human skeletal alpha-actin ( HSA or ACTA1 ) gene ( Miniou et al . , 1999; Li et al . , 2008; Wu et al . , 2012a , 2012b ) . As shown in Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C , D , HA-tagged Ctnnb1 and mutants were expressed in muscles of ACTA1-Cre::LSL-Ctnnb1 , but not in muscles of ACTA1-Cre or mice that carried only the transgenes . Moreover , the transgene expression was muscle-specific and not detectable in other tissues including spinal cord ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1D , E ) ( data not shown ) . ACTA1-Cre::LSL-Ctnnb1 , ACTA1-Cre::LSL-Ctnnb1TV-AA , and ACTA1-Cre::LSL-Ctnnb1\u2206TAD mice were viable and fertile and exhibited normal NMJ morphology , compared to control mice ( ACTA1-Cre or Ctnnb1fl/fl ) ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1F ) ( data not shown ) . No difference was observed in location of primary branches of the phrenic nerves , secondary branches , and location and size of AChR clusters at postnatal day 0 ( P0 ) between controls and mutants ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1F ) ( data not shown ) . We bred the LSL-transgenic mice with ACTA1-Cre::Ctnnb1fl/+ mice ( ACTA1-Ctnnb1fl/+ ) to determine whether and which transgene was able to rescue NMJ deficits by Ctnnb1 mutation . Notice that both the expression of wildtype or mutant Ctnnb1 and the deletion of endogenous Ctnnb1 depend on the ACTA1 promoter . In control mice ( Ctnnb1fl/fl ) , primary branches of the phrenic nerve were located in the middle of muscle fibers . The secondary branches were numerous and short , many of which end with AChR clusters that were confined to the central region of muscle fibers ( Lin et al . , 2000; Li et al . , 2008 ) ( Figure 1A ) . However , in ACTA1-Ctnnb1\u2212/\u2212 ( i . e . , CATA1::Cre;Catnnb1f/f ) mutants , the primary branches were mislocated to the tendon region close to the central cavity , the secondary branches were fewer and longer , and the region where AChR cluster distributed became wider ( Figure 1 ) . As expected , expression of wild-type Ctnnb1 was able to rescue these phenotypes ( Figure 1 ) . Interestingly , these phenotypes were also completely rescued by Ctnnb1TV-AA since no difference was detectable in primary branch location , secondary branch number and length , and endplate band width between ACTA1-Ctnnb1\u2212/\u2212::LSL-Ctnnb1\u0394TAD mice and control or ACTA1-Ctnnb1\u2212/\u2212::LSL-Ctnnb1 mice , indicating that the cell-adhesion function of Ctnnb1 is not necessary for presynaptic differentiation . In contrast , however , the TAD deletion mutant was unable to rescue these phenotypes , suggesting a requirement of the transcription function ( Figure 1 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 07266 . 003Figure 1 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 07266 . 004 We have shown that muscle-specific ablation of Ctnnb1 disrupts presynaptic structure and function ( Li et al . , 2008; Wu et al . , 2012a ) . To determine whether the presynaptic deficits could be rescued , we performed electron microscopic analysis . In control mice , axon terminals were filled with synaptic vesicles , some of which were docked on electron-dense active zones ( Figure 2 ) . The vesicle density in control terminals was 3 . 6 \u00b1 0 . 30 vesicles/0 . 04 \u03bcm2 . In contrast , the density was reduced to 1 . 40 \u00b1 0 . 37 vesicles/0 . 04 \u03bcm2 in ACTA1-Ctnnb1\u2212/\u2212 terminals ( p < 0 . 001 ) , in agreement with previous report ( Liu et al . , 2012; Wu et al . , 2012a ) . As shown in Figure 2 , the reduction in vesicle density was diminished by expressing Ctnnb1 or Ctnnb1TV-AA , with 3 . 6 \u00b1 0 . 33 and 3 . 99 \u00b1 0 . 33 vesicle/0 . 04 mm2 in ACTA1-Ctnnb1\u2212/\u2212::LSL-Ctnnb1 mice and ACTA1-Ctnnb1\u2212/\u2212::LSL-Ctnnb1TV-AA mice , respectively ( p < 0 . 001 in comparison with ACTA1-Ctnnb1\u2212/\u2212 , n = 17 ) ( Figure 2A , B ) . These results indicated that presynaptic deficits could be rescued by wild-type Ctnnb1 or Ctnnb1TV-AA , suggesting a dispensable role of the cell-adhesion function of Ctnnb1 . In contrast , synaptic vesicle density in ACTA1-Ctnnb1\u2212/\u2212::LSL-Ctnnb1\u2206TAD remained low , at 1 . 33 \u00b1 0 . 50 vesicles/0 . 04 \u03bcm2 , which was not different from ACTA1-Ctnnb1\u2212/\u2212 mice ( p > 0 . 05 in comparison with control; n = 17 ) ( Figure 2A , B ) , demonstrating inability of the \u0394TAD mutant to rescue and suggesting an important role of the transcription regulation in the retrograde pathway . Similarly , active zones were fewer in ACTA1-Ctnnb1\u2212/\u2212 mice and ACTA1-Ctnnb1\u2212/\u2212::LSL-Ctnnb1\u2206TAD mice , compared with control mice , ACTA1-Ctnnb1\u2212/\u2212::LSL-Ctnnb1 mice , and ACTA1-Ctnnb1\u2212/\u2212::LSL-Ctnnb1TV-AA mice ( Figure 2A , C ) . As reported previously ( Wu et al . , 2012a ) , Ctnnb1 mutation in muscles did not alter the number of terminals per NMJ and the width of synaptic clefts . Expression of Ctnnb1 wild type or mutants did not change these parameters ( Figure 2A , D , E ) . These results are in agreement with the notion that muscle Ctnnb1 mainly regulates presynaptic differentiation . 10 . 7554/eLife . 07266 . 005Figure 2 .

NMJ , neuromuscular junction . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 07266 . 006 In addition to morphological studies , we measured miniature end-plate potentials ( mEPPs ) , events that are generated by spontaneous vesicle release . There was about 50% reduction in mEPP frequency in ACTA1-Ctnnb1\u2212/\u2212 mice , compared with control mice ( Li et al . , 2008 ) ( Figure 3A , B ) ( 1 . 04 \u00b1 0 . 04 Hz for control; 0 . 45 \u00b1 0 . 04 Hz for ACTA1-Ctnnb1\u2212/\u2212 , p < 0 . 001; n = 4 ) , but no change in mEPP amplitude ( Figure 3A , C ) . These results were in agreement with morphological presynaptic deficits ( Figures 1 , 2 ) . The frequency reduction phenotype was rescued by both wild-type Ctnnb1 and the TV-AA mutant ( 0 . 95 \u00b1 0 . 09 Hz in ACTA1-Ctnnb1\u2212/\u2212::LSL-Ctnnb1 and 1 . 06 \u00b1 0 . 04 Hz in ACTA1-Ctnnb1\u2212/\u2212::LSL-Ctnnb1TV-AA , p > 0 . 05 in comparison with control; n = 4 ) ( Figure 3A , B ) . In contrast , mEPP frequency remained depressed in ACTA1-Ctnnb1\u2212/\u2212::LSL-Ctnnb1\u0394TAD mice ( Figure 3A , B ) . Together , these results of both morphological and functional studies indicate the requirement of the Ctnnb1's TAD in motor nerve terminal differentiation and suggest that Ctnnb1-regulated transcription is necessary for motor nerve terminal differentiation . 10 . 7554/eLife . 07266 . 007Figure 3 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 07266 . 007 To determine whether Ctnnb1 is locally activated , we performed the following two experiments ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . First , whole-mount staining of muscle fibers with Ctnnb1 antibody indicates that Ctnnb1 in synaptic nuclei appeared to be higher than that in extra-synaptic regions ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A ) . Second , we characterized Axin2-nlacZ mice , where the nuclear-localized \u03b2-galactosidase ( nlacZ ) DNA was inserted in the Axin2 gene , a target of Wnt/Ctnnb1 signaling . Expression of \u03b2-galactosidase in Axin2-nlacZ mice is controlled , which has been used as a reporter of Wnt or Ctnnb1 activity ( Lustig et al . , 2002 ) . As shown in Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B , \u03b2-galactosidase was detectable in synaptic nuclei , not in extra-synaptic nuclei . These results are in agreement with the notion of active Wnt/Ctnnb1 signaling in synaptic nuclei at the NMJ and provide additional support to the model . The necessity of the TAD in muscle Ctnnb1 regulation of presynaptic terminals suggests that genes whose expression is controlled by Ctnnb1 may serve as retrograde factors . To identify such a factor , we performed quantitative real-time PCR ( qRT-PCR ) to screen for genes that are down-regulated in ACTA1-Ctnnb1\u2212/\u2212 muscles , compared with Ctnnb1fl/fl control . We focused on secretable and transmembrane proteins in particular muscle-derived extracellular matrix proteins , trophic factors , morphogens , and environmental cues ( Figure 4B\u2013E ) . C-Myc and Axin2 , whose expression is regulated by Ctnnb1 ( He et al . , 1998; Yan et al . , 2001 ) , were used a positive control . Their mRNAs were lower in ACTA1-Ctnnb1\u2212/\u2212 muscles than control , indicating the validity of the method ( Figure 4A ) . In a panel of more than 70 genes , 9 were reduced in expression in ACTA1-Ctnnb1\u2212/\u2212 , compared to control Ctnnb1fl/fl mice ( Figure 4 ) . Of particular interest is Slit2 , a repulsive axon guidance cue of the Slit family ( Brose et al . , 1999; Kidd et al . , 1999 ) . Slit2 as well as Slit1 regulate axon collateral formation ( Nguyen Ba-Charvet et al . , 1999 ) . Interestingly , mutation of Slit2 , but not Slit1 or Slit3 , disrupts motoneuron fasciculation and primary nerve location ( Jaworski and Tessier-Lavigne , 2012 ) , akin to NMJ morphological deficits of ACTA1-Ctnnb1\u2212/\u2212 mice . Of the three members of the Slit family , only Slit2 was down-regulated in ACTA1-Ctnnb1\u2212/\u2212 muscles ( Figure 4E ) . The reduction was also confirmed by Western blot analysis of ACTA1-Ctnnb1\u2212/\u2212 muscle homogenates ( Figure 5A , B ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 07266 . 008Figure 4 . Slit2 was reduced in ACTA1-Ctnnb1\u2212/\u2212 muscle . RNA was purified from P0 muscles of Ctnnb1fl/fl ( black ) and ACTA1-Ctnnb1\u2212/\u2212 ( red ) and subjected to quantitative real-time PCR . Of 70 genes , the expression of 25 was negligible . Shown were genes in different groups: known Ctnnb1 targets ( A ) , ECM ( extracellular matrix ) proteins ( B ) , trophic factors ( C ) , morphogens ( D ) , and environmental cues ( E ) .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 07266 . 009 Muscle homogenates contain , in addition to muscle , nerve terminals , Schwann cells , and blood vessels and connective tissues where Slit2 may be expressed ( Huang et al . , 2011; Jaworski and Tessier-Lavigne , 2012 ) . To demonstrate that Slit2 is expressed in muscle cells and the expression is regulated by Ctnnb1 , we transfected C2C12 myoblasts with HA-tagged Ctnnb1 and resulting myotubes were subjected to Western blotting for endogenous Slit2 . As shown in Figure 5C , elevating Ctnnb1 level increased the expression of endogenous Slit2 in a dose-dependent manner . This result indicates that Ctnnb1 stimulates the expression of Slit2 in muscle cells . Ctnnb1 regulates gene expression by binding to the Tcf4/Lef1 transcription factors ( Behrens et al . , 1996; van de Wetering et al . , 1997 ) . We identified several putative Tcf4/Lef1-binding sites in the 5\u2032UTR of the Slit2 gene using ChIP-MAPPER ( Marinescu et al . , 2005 ) . There were a Tcf4 and a Lef1 site between \u22121061 and \u2212929 bases and two Tcf4 sites between \u2212582 and \u2212567 bases upstream from the transcription initiation site ( Figure 5D ) . To determine whether Ctnnb1 in fact binds to these sites , we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation ( ChIP ) assay using C2C12 myotubes . DNA fragments associated with Ctnnb1 were immunoprecipitated with anti-Ctnnb1 antibody and subjected to PCR using primers that flank these two regions ( Figure 5D ) . As shown in Figure 5E , a specific band was detected using the primers ( \u2212582\u2013567 ) , suggesting that Ctnnb1 is associated with the Tcf4 sites . In contrast , no band was detected using the primers ( \u22121061 and \u2212929 ) , although the primers were able to detect a band in input , suggesting that the Tcf4 and Lef1 sites in this region may not be able to bind to Ctnnb1 . Together , these results suggest that Ctnnb1 binds to the promoter region of the Slit2 gene to promote its expression in muscle cells . Having demonstrated that Slit2 is a target of Ctnnb1-regulated transcription in muscles , we wanted to determine if overexpressing Slit2 in muscles was able to rescue presynaptic deficits in ACTA1-Ctnnb1\u2212/\u2212 mice . It should if the hypothesis is correct . To this end , we generated a transgenic mouse , ACTA1-Slit2 , which expressed Flag-Slit2 under the control of the ACTA1 promoter ( Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A , B ) . The ACTA1 promoter drives muscle-specific expression at embryonic day 9 . 5 ( E9 . 5 ) ( Crawford et al . , 2000 ) and has been useful to study NMJ assembly ( Kim and Burden , 2008; Wu et al . , 2012a , 2012b ) . The transgene Flag-Slit2 was expressed in muscles of ACTA1-Slit2 mice , but not muscles of control mice ( Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1B ) . Flag-Slit2 expression was muscle-specific and not detectable in other tissues including the spinal cord ( data not shown ) . Interestingly , many of presynaptic morphological deficits of ACTA1-Ctnnb1\u2212/\u2212 mice were rescued by Slit2 , including reduced nerve terminal coverage ( as indicated by synaptophysin staining ) ( Figure 6A\u2013C ) , reduced vesicle density ( Figure 7A , B ) , and reduced active zones ( Figure 7A , C ) . While the number of nerve terminals and synaptic cleft width in either ACTA1-Ctnnb1\u2212/\u2212 mutant or ACTA1-Ctnnb1\u2212/\u2212::ACTA1-Slit2 rescue mice are not affected ( Figure 7D , E ) . These results indicate that overexpressing Slit2 in muscles was sufficient to diminish presynaptic structural deficits that are caused by muscle Ctnnb1 deficiency , in agreement with the notion that Slit2 acts downstream of Ctnnb1 . To test this hypothesis further , we characterized neuromuscular transmission of ACTA1-Ctnnb1\u2212/\u2212::ACTA1-Slit2 mice . Loss of Ctnnb1 in muscles resulted in reduced mEPP frequency but not amplitude ( Figure 7F\u2013H ) ( Li et al . , 2008 ) . Remarkably , mEPP frequency in ACTA1-Ctnnb1\u2212/\u2212::ACTA1-Slit2 mice was higher than that of ACTA1-Ctnnb1\u2212/\u2212 mice , suggesting again that the vesicle release deficit was rescued by muscle expression of Slit2 . The rescue effect of nerve terminal structure and function appeared to be specific because overexpression of Slit2 in muscles had no effect on mislocation of primary nerve branches , reduced number of secondary branches , and increased length of secondary branches ( Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2A\u2013E ) . The effects of muscle expression of Slit2 on post-synaptic deficits were mixed . Ablation of Ctnnb1 in muscles ( in ACTA1-Ctnnb1\u2212/\u2212 mice ) enlarges AChR clusters and increased the central band area where AChR clusters are distributed ( Li et al . , 2008 ) . Slit2 muscle expression had no effect on AChR cluster length or area of ACTA1-Ctnnb1\u2212/\u2212 mice ( Figure 6A , D , E ) . However , the enlarged central band area where AChR clusters are distributed in ACTA1-Ctnnb1\u2212/\u2212 mice was reduced ( Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2A , E ) . Together , these observations indicate muscle-specific expression of Slit2 was able to rescue presynaptic structural and functional deficits at nerve terminals . 10 . 7554/eLife . 07266 . 010Figure 6 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 07266 . 013 The finding that muscle expression of Slit2 is sufficient to increase vesicle numbers and active zones in Ctnnb1-deficient mice suggested to us that Slit2 may be synaptogenic . Once released from muscles , Slit2 may be concentrated at the NMJ , like muscle-expressed AChE ( Rotundo et al . , 2008; Barik et al . , 2014a ) . To test these hypotheses , we stained muscles with anti-Slit2 antibody . As shown in Figure 8A , the immunoreactivity co-localized with R-BTX and synaptophysin ( Figure 8A ) , indicating that Slit2 is enriched in synaptic basal lamina ( SBL ) . To determine whether concentrated Slit2 was able to induce nerve terminal differentiation , we expressed Slit2 in HEK293 cells ( Figure 8B ) . Purified Slit2 was immobilized on fluorescently conjugated latex microspheres ( beads ) , which were then incubated with spinal cord explant ( ventral horn ) in culture ( Figure 8C ) . The culture was stained for synaptophysin 24 hr later . As shown in Figure 8C\u2013E , 46 . 9 \u00b1 2 . 62% of Slit2-beads were positive for synaptophysin , whereas , in contrast , only 18 . 6 \u00b1 1 . 47% of controls were synaptophysin-positive ( n = 10 , p < 0 . 001 ) ( Figure 8C , D ) . Moreover , the size of synaptophysin puncta was also increased with Slit2-conjugated beads , compared with controls ( Figure 8C , E ) . Together , these results suggest that immobilized Slit2 may be sufficient to induce synaptophysin clusters of cultured spinal cord explant . 10 . 7554/eLife . 07266 . 014Figure 8 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 07266 . 014 \n Many molecules have been identified to regulate presynaptic differentiation at the NMJ . For example , muscle-derived FGF 7/10/22 and collagens IV and XIII were shown to induce synaptic vesicle clusters at nerve terminals or regulate presynaptic maturation ( Fox et al . , 2007; Latvanlehto et al . , 2010 ) . In Drosophila , wishful thinking and Glass bottom boat , a TGF\u03b2 receptor and ligand , respectively , were shown to be important for presynaptic T-bar formation ( Marques et al . , 2000; McCabe et al . , 2003 , 2004 ) . GDNF ( glial cell derived neurotrophic factor ) , known to affect motoneuron survival in vitro , was shown to affect pre- and post-synaptic neurotransmission in frog neuron-muscle co-cultures ( Oppenheim et al . , 1995; Keller-Peck et al . , 2001; Wang et al . , 2002 ) . Laminin \u03b22 , a protein concentrated in SBL , could inhibit neurite outgrowth and regulate nerve terminal differentiation and maturation ( Noakes et al . , 1995; Fox et al . , 2007 ) . It is thought to bind directly to and cluster calcium channels , which in turn recruit other presynaptic components ( Nishimune et al . , 2004 ) . In Integrin\u03b21 muscle-specific mutant mice , nerve terminal arborization and differentiation are abnormal ( Schwander et al . , 2004 ) . Lrp4 and MuSK were shown to be critical for presynaptic differentiation independently ( Kim and Burden , 2008; Yumoto et al . , 2012; Wu et al . , 2012b ) . Previously , we demonstrated that Ctnnb1 in muscle is critical for the differentiation of motor nerve terminals ( Li et al . , 2008 ) . In this paper , we dissected out which functions of muscle Ctnnb1 is critical by an in vivo transgenic approach . We showed that muscle overexpression of the Ctnnb1 mutant without the TAD was unable to rescue the presynaptic deficits of Ctnnb1 mutation , indicating that the transcription regulation is critical for muscle Ctnnb1 to control presynaptic differentiation . On the other hand , the cell-adhesion function of Ctnnb1 is dispensable . These results suggest that muscle Ctnnb1 is likely to regulate presynaptic differentiation by controlling the expression of muscle-derived proteins . This notion was supported by the observations that Ctnnb1 and Wnt signaling reporter were higher in synaptic nuclei at the NMJ than those in extra-synaptic areas . We reasoned that such a protein is secretable or has a transmembrane domain and its expression is down-regulated in Ctnnb1 mutant muscle . A screen for proteins that fulfill these criteria led to the identification of Slit2 . We showed , first , that Ctnnb1 associates with Tcf/Lef cis-elements in the promoter region of the Slit2 gene . Second , Slit2 expression in muscle cells is promoted by elevating Ctnnb1 . Slit2 was concentrated at the NMJ . Third , transgenic mice expressing Slit2 specifically in the muscle were able to diminish presynaptic deficits by Ctnnb1 mutation , including poor innervation , reduced vesicle density and active zone , and depressed mEPP . Finally , Slit2 immobilized on beads was able to induce the synaptophysin puncta of axons of spinal cord explants . Together , these observations suggest that Slit2 serves as a factor utilized by muscle Ctnnb1 to direct presynaptic differentiation . Slit2 is a member of the Slit family of secreted glycoproteins , which serve as repulsive cues for axons of various neurons ( Nguyen-Ba-Charvet et al . , 2002; Shu et al . , 2003; Marillat et al . , 2004; Sabatier et al . , 2004; Hussain et al . , 2006 ) , as regulators to promote axonal and dendritic branching ( Brose et al . , 1999; Wang et al . , 1999; Nguyen Ba-Charvet et al . , 2001; Whitford et al . , 2002; Miyashita et al . , 2004 ) , and as repellants for neuron migration ( Wu et al . , 1999 ) . A previous work showed that motor neurons use Slit2 to promote their axon fasciculation by an autocrine or juxtaparacrine mechanism ( Jaworski and Tessier-Lavigne , 2012 ) . In Slit2 mutant mice , motor nerves prematurely defasciculate into smaller bundlers in various muscles , unlike those in wild type that stay in compact fascicle until they reach the middle of muscle fibers . NMJ morphology at gross anatomic level appears to be normal in Slit2 mutant mice ( Jaworski and Tessier-Lavigne , 2012 ) . We show that Slit2 is produced by muscle cells in a manner dependent on Ctnnb1 . Remarkably , Slit2 , when immobilized on beads , was synaptogenic\u2014to promote the formation and enlargement of synaptophysin-positive punta . Soluble Slit2 did not have this effect , suggesting that the effect requires local , high concentration as many synaptogenic proteins do ( Dean et al . , 2003; Yumoto et al . , 2012 ) . This high concentration in vivo may be achieved by its enrichment at the NMJ , probably due to the involvement of the laminin-G domain of Slit2's extracellular region . The laminin-G domain is known to mediate the SBL immobilization of many proteins including agrin , \u03b1-dystroglycan , perlecan , and neurexin ( Timpl et al . , 2000; Chedotal , 2007 ) . The molecular mechanism of Slit2's synaptogenic effect warrants future investigation . Interestingly , the extracellular region of Slit2 has four leucine-rich repeats ( LRR ) -11-residue sequence rich in leucines at defined positions ( LxxLxLxxNxL , x being any amino acid ) . The LRRs have been conserved in some synaptogenic proteins ( de Wit et al . , 2011 ) . The presynaptic deficits in ACTA1-Ctnnb1\u2212/\u2212 mice can be grouped into two . One includes mislocation of the primary branches of the phrenic nerve and secondary branch arborization and length , while the other consists of synaptic vesicle number reduction , fewer active zones , and reduced mEPP frequency that was due to reduced release probability ( Li et al . , 2008 ) . This observation suggests that the \u2018trophic\u2019 activity of limb buds or muscles identified in the classic limb bud removal experiment is mediated by a Ctnnb1-independent mechanism . Interestingly , Slit2 muscle expression was able to rescue the second group of presynaptic deficits . Besides Slit2 , several other secretable factors were found lower in ACTA1-Ctnnb1\u2212/\u2212 muscles . Their function in NMJ formation may be limited or opposite of the hypothetic factor downstream of muscle Ctnnb1 . For example , Mmp9 and Cxcl15 mutant mice are viable and presumably have normal NMJ function ( D'Arcangelo et al . , 1996; Coussens et al . , 2000; Chen et al . , 2001 ) , excluding their involvement in the Ctnnb1 regulation . Hgf was shown to be necessary for motor neuron survival ( Wong et al . , 1997; Yamamoto et al . , 1997 ) ; however , the number of motor neurons was not reduced in ACTA1-Ctnnb1\u2212/\u2212 mice or in mice overexpressing Ctnnb1 in muscles ( Wu et al . , 2012a ) . \u03b21-Integrin in muscle is known to be required for NMJ formation ( Schwander et al . , 2004 ) . In particular , axons in \u03b21-Integrin mutant mice failed to respect muscle boundaries and grew onto the tendon organ . However , they do not have nerve defasciculation defects as observed in Ctnnb1-mutant mice . These results do not support a possible involvement of these factors in muscle Ctnnb1 regulation of presynaptic differentiation . It is worthy pointing out that Slit2 overexpression in muscles has no effect on deficits involving primary and secondary branches . Therefore , presynaptic differentiation may be regulated by multiple factors derived from the skeletal muscle . Recent evidence suggests that Wnt signaling regulates NMJ formation . Some Wnts can stimulate while others inhibit agrin-induced AChR clustering ( Henriquez et al . , 2008; Strochlic et al . , 2012; Zhang et al . , 2012; Barik et al . , 2014b ) . The receptor of Wnts at the NMJ may include MuSK that has a CRD domain homologous to that in the Wnt receptor Frizzled ( Masiakowski and Yancopoulos , 1998 ) and LRP4 , a member of the LDLR family whose members , like LRP5/6 , serve are Wnt receptors ( Tamai et al . , 2000 ) . In zebrafish , MuSK is thought to interact with Wnt11r to regulate NMJ formation ( Zhang et al . , 2004; Jing et al . , 2009 ) . Moreover , many Wnt signaling molecules have been implicated in NMJ development , including Dvl and APC ( Luo et al . , 2002; Wang et al , 2003 ) . The deletion of the CRD domain of MuSK in mice causes both pre- and post-synaptic defects of the neuromuscular junction ( Mess\u00e9ant et al . , 2015 ) . Whether Ctnnb1 regulation of presynaptic differentiation is downstream of Wnts is unclear . There are 19 Wnt ligands in mice , which makes it difficult to investigate their function by mutant mice . Perhaps due to functional redundancy , mice lacking Wnt4 or Wnt11 , an isoform most homologous to Wnt11r in zebrafish , were able to form NMJ ( Banerjee et al . , 2011; Strochlic et al . , 2012 ) . \n Ctnnb1 conditional KO mice were generated by crossing floxed Ctnnb1 ( Ctnnb1fl/fl ) ( Jackson Laboratory; stock #:004152 ) with ACTA1-Cre transgenic mice that were generously provided by Dr . Melki , to generate the ACTA1-Ctnnb1\u2212/\u2212 mice which lacked Ctnnb1 in skeletal muscles . For the rescue experiments , three loxP-STOP-loxP ( LSL ) -Ctnnb1 transgenic mice ( wild-type Ctnnb1; Ctnnb1TV-AA and Ctnnb1\u2206TAD ) were generated . Ctnnb1TV-AA and Ctnnb1\u2206TAD ( lacking amino acids 684\u2013781 ) were generated using PCR . The HA tag at the C-terminus was added by subcloning the transgenes into the SalI and XbaI sites of pKH3 . HA-tagged wild type and mutants were subcloned into the XhoI and NotI sites of pCCALL2 ( loxP-STOP-loxP ) vector to generate LSL-Ctnnb1 or mutant mice . LSL-transgenic mice were crossed with Ctnnb1fl/+ to generate Ctnnb1fl/+;LSL-Ctnnb1 or mutant mice . To generate ACTA1-Slit2 mice , Flag-Slit2 was subcloned into pBSX-ACTA1 as described previously ( Monks et al . , 2007 ) . Axin2-nlacZ mice were obtained from Jackson laboratory ( stock #:009120 ) . DNA sequences of all transgenes were validated by sequencing . Linearized DNA was microinjected into FVB blastocysts , which were introduced into pseudo-pregnant recipient females . Mice were genotyped by PCR analysis of tail biopsy DNA . Tail DNA was digested with buffer A ( 25 mM NaOH , 0 . 2 mM EDTA ( ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid ) ) for 45 min at 100\u00b0C and neutralized with buffer B ( 40 mM Tris\u2013HCl , pH 8 . 0 ) for genotyping . Mice were housed in cages that were maintained in a room with 12-hr light/dark cycle with ad libitum access to water and rodent chow diet ( Diet 1/4\u2033 7097 , Harlan Teklad ) . P0 pups of either sex were analyzed , unless otherwise indicated . \u2018Material and method\u2019 have been approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee ( IACUC ) of Georgia Regents University . Muscles were lysed in modified RIPA buffer ( 50 mM Tris\u2013HCl , pH 7 . 4 , 150 mM NaCl , 1% NP-40 , 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate ( SDS ) , 2% deoxycholate , 1 mM PMSF ( phenylmethanesulfonylfluoride ) , 1 mM EDTA , 5 mM sodium fluoride , 2 mM sodium orthovanadate , and protease inhibitors including 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride , 1 \u03bcg/\u03bcl pepstatin , 1 \u03bcg/\u03bcl leupeptin , and 2 \u03bcg/ml aprotinin ) . After centrifuging at 10 , 000 RPM at 4\u00b0C , supernatant was designated as lysates . Protein concentration was measured using Pierce BCA kit . Samples ( 50 \u03bcg of protein ) were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane , which was incubated in 5% milk in phosphate buffer saline ( PBS ) -0 . 3%Tween20 overnight at 4\u00b0C and then with primary antibodies in 2% milk in PBS-Tween buffer: Ctnnb1 ( 1:2000 , Cell Signaling #9562 ) ( Danvers , MA ) ; Slit2 ( 1:1500 , Abcam , ab7665 ) ( San Francisco , CA ) ; HA ( 1:2000 , Sigma , H9658 ) ( St . Louis , MO ) ; Flag ( 1:1500 , Sigma , F3165 ) ; GFP ( 1:1000 , Sigma , G1546 ) ; Cre ( 1:400 , Abcam , Ab24607 ) ; \u03b2-actin ( 1:4000 , Sigma , A5441 ) . After washing , the membrane was incubated with PBS-Tween buffer containing HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse and rabbit IgG from Pierce ( 1:5 , 000 , PI-31430 [anti-mouse] , PI-31460 [anti-rabbit] ) . Immunoreactive bands were visualized by using enhanced chemiluminescence ( Life Technologies , Grand Island , NY ) . Quantitative densitometry of captured images was analyzed with Image J ( NIH ) , as described before ( Barik et al . , 2014a ) . Diaphragms were stained whole mount as previously described with modification ( Li et al . , 2008; Wu et al . , 2012a , 2012b ) . Briefly , entire diaphragms with ribs were freshly dissected from mice and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde ( PFA ) in PBS ( pH7 . 3 ) at 4\u00b0C for 3 days , rinsed with PBS ( pH 7 . 3 ) at 25\u00b0C , and incubated with 0 . 1 M glycine in PBS for 1 hr at room temperature . The pH of PBS including PFA was critical for proper staining . After rinse with 0 . 5% Triton X-100 in PBS , diaphragms were incubated in the blocking buffer ( 5% bovine serum albumin [BSA] and 1% Triton X-100 in PBS ) for 3 hr at room temperature . Tissues were then incubated with primary antibodies in the blocking buffer overnight at room temperature on a rotating shaker . After washing 3 times for 1 hr each with 0 . 5% Triton X-100 in PBS , tissues were incubated with Alexa Fluor 488 or Alexa Fluor 633-conjugated antibody to rabbit or mouse IgG ( 1:500 , Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) and rhodamine-conjugated \u03b1-BTX/alexa-488 conjugated \u03b1-BTX ( 1:2000 , Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) overnight at room temperature . After washing 3 times for 1 hr each with 0 . 5% Triton X-100 in PBS and rinsing once with PBS , tissues were flat-mounted in Vectashield mounting medium ( H-1000 , Vector laboratories , Burlingame , CA ) . Z-serial images were collected with a Zeiss confocal laser scanning microscope ( LSM 510 META 3 . 2 ) and collapsed into a single image . For quantitative analysis , images were captured at a subsaturating amplifier gain without modification and quantified using LSM Image Browser and FIJI ( NIH ) software ( Wu et al . , 2012a , 2012b; Barik et al . , 2014a ) . Electron microscopy was performed as described previously ( Wu et al . , 2012a , 2012b; Barik et al . , 2014a ) . Entire diaphragms were lightly stained with R-BTX ( 1:1000 , in ice cold PBS at 4\u00b0C ) to mark the central region where NMJs are enriched . The regions were dissected with a micro scalpel ( Harvard apparatus , #PY2 56-5673 ) under a Leica fluorescent dissection scope and fixed ( blocks of approximately 4 mm \u00d7 4 mm ) in 2% glutaraldehyde and 2% PFA in 0 . 1 M PBS for overnight at 4\u00b0C . Tissues were further fixed in sodium cacodylate-buffered ( pH 7 . 3 ) 1% osmium tetroxide for 1 hr at 25\u00b0C . Fixed tissues were washed 3 times with PBS and subjected to dehydration through a series of ethanol: 30% , 50% , 70% , 80% , 90% , and 100% . After 3 rinses with 100% propylene oxide , samples were embedded in plastic resin ( EM-bed 812 , EM Sciences ) . Serial sections ( 1\u20132 \u03bcm ) were stained with 1% Toluidine Blue to identify motor nerves and were cut into ultra-thin sections . Alternate longitudinal sections were not chosen to avoid duplicity of obtaining images from same terminals . They were mounted on 200-mesh unsupported copper grids and stained with a solution containing 3% uranyl acetate , 50% methanol , 2 . 6% lead nitrate , and 3 . 5% sodium citrate ( pH 12 . 0 ) . Electron micrographs were taken using a JEOL 100CXII operated at 80 KeV . Recording was performed as described previously ( Li et al . , 2008; Wu et al . , 2012a , 2012b; Barik et al . , 2014a ) . Neonatal mice diaphragms with ribs and intact phrenic nerves were dissected in oxygenated ( 95% O2/5% CO2 ) Ringer's solution ( 136 . 8 mM NaCl , 5 mM KCl , 12 mM NaHCO3 , 1 mM NaH2PO4 , 1 mM MgCl2 , 2 mM CaCl2 , and 11 mM D-glucose , pH 7 . 3 ) and pinned on Sylgard gel in a dish perfused with oxygenated Ringer's solution . To measure mEPP , microelectrodes , 20\u201350 M\u2126 when filled with 3 M KCl , were pierced into the center of muscle fibers with the resting potential between \u221245 and \u221255 mV . To evoke end-plate potentials , phrenic nerves were stimulated by a suction electrode with suprathreshold square pulses ( 0 . 1 ms ) using Master-8 ( A . M . P . I , Jerusalem , Israel ) . Data were collected with axonpatch 200B amplifier ( Molecular Devices , Sunnyvale , CA ) , digitized with Digidata 1322A ( Molecular Devices , Sunnyvale , CA ) , and analyzed using pClamp 9 . 2 ( Molecular Devices , Sunnyvale , CA ) . Mouse muscle C2C12 myoblasts were propagated and induced to form myotubes as described previously ( Luo et al . , 2003 ) . C2C12 myoblasts were transfected with lipofectamine 2000 ( Invitrogen , 11 , 668-019 ) with a modified protocol . C2C12 myoblasts , at 70\u201380% confluence , were rinsed once with serum-free medium before transfection because serum appeared to reduce transfection efficiency . After complete aspiration of the medium , myoblasts were incubated with a mixture of DNA , lipofectamine , and serum-free medium for 8 hr when the medium was changed to the growth medium . The DNA:lipofectamine ratio in the mixture was 1 \u03bcg:2 \u03bcl . The optimal volume of the mixture for 24-well dishes was 200 \u03bcl medium per well that contained 2 \u03bcg plasmid DNA . HEK293 cells were cultured and transfected as previously described ( Luo et al . , 2008; Wu et al . , 2012b ) . ChIP assays were performed according to the protocol provided by Upstate Biotechnology ( Kim et al . , 2005 ) . C2C12 myotubes were cultured on gelatin-coated 6-well dish , transfected with HA-Ctnnb1 , were washed twice with PBS and then incubated in 1% formaldehyde in PBS at room temperature for 10 min . After washing twice with PBS , cells were scraped in PBS containing protease inhibitors , centrifuged at 2000 rpm at 4\u00b0C , and resuspended in SDS lysis buffer containing 1% SDS , 10 mM EDTA , 50 mM Tris\u2013HCl ( pH 8 . 0 ) plus protease inhibitors . Cells were sonicated by Sonic Dismembrator model 100 ( Fisher , Suwanee , GA ) , strength 3 , for 15 s 3 times , to shear chromosome DNA . After centrifugation at 13 , 000 at 4\u00b0C , the sonicated mixture was diluted 10-fold with ChIP dilution buffer containing 0 . 01% SDS , 1 . 1% Triton X-100 , 1 . 2 mM EDTA , 16 . 7 mM Tris\u2013HCl ( pH 8 . 1 ) , and 167 mM NaCl . The mixture was precleaned once with salmon sperm DNA-protein A-agarose beads at 4\u00b0C for 1 hr . The resulting supernatant was incubated with anti-Ctnnb1 antibody at 4\u00b0C overnight , when salmon sperm DNA-protein A-agarose beads ( 50 \u03bcg/\u03bcl ) was added . The beads/mixture was incubated for another hour at 4\u00b0C and washed sequentially with a low-salt wash buffer containing 0 . 1% SDS , 1% Triton X-100 , 2 mM EDTA , 20 mM Tris\u2013HCl ( pH 8 . 1 ) , and 150 mM NaCl; a high-salt wash buffer containing 0 . 1% SDS , 1% Triton X-100 , 2 mM EDTA , 20 mM Tris\u2013HCl ( pH 8 . 1 ) , and 500 mM NaCl; an LiCl wash buffer containing 0 . 25 M LiCl , 1% NP-40 , 1% deoxycholic acid , 1 mM EDTA , and 10 mM Tris\u2013HCl ( pH 8 . 1 ) ; and a wash with TE buffer . Beads were then incubated twice with 250 \u03bcl of the elution buffer ( 1% SDS , 0 . 1 M NaHCO3 ) for 15 min at room temperature to elute bound DNA . Combined eluates were added to 20 \u03bcl of 5 M NaCl to reverse cross-links by heating at 65\u00b0C for 4 hr . After incubation with 10 \u03bcl of 0 . 5 M EDTA , 20 \u03bcl of 1 M Tris\u2013HCl ( pH 6 . 5 ) , and 2 \u03bcl of 10 mg/ml proteinase K ( 1 hr at 45\u00b0C ) , DNA was recovered by phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation and used as template for PCR . Primers for the two TCF4/ LEF1-binding regions were as follows; Slit2 ( primer1 ) - 5\u2032-GTCCC CTTTA GGATC GCG-3\u2032/5\u2032-CAGCG GGAGA ACGAG G-3\u2032 and Slit2 ( primer2 ) -5\u2032-AGAGA AGGTT GAAAA CACTA CTCCC-3\u2032/5\u2032-TGAAA TAGAT CTGCC TCCGT G-3\u2032 . Total RNA was isolated from muscles using Trizol ( Invitrogen ) and purified using the RNeasy mini kit ( Qiagen ) . Quantitative RT-PCR was performed as described previously ( Wu et al . , 2012a ) . Equal amounts of total RNA ( 1 \u03bcg ) were reverse transcribed by random hexamer primers using the Maxima Enzyme Mix ( Fermentas ) . Quantitative PCRs were run in a PTC-200 Peltier Thermal Cycler ( Bio-Rad MJ Research ) using SYBR Green/ROX ( Fermentas ) . The primers for specific genes are listed in Supplementary file 1 . Spinal cord explant culture from E12 . 5 embryos was performed as previously described ( Wang and Marquardt , 2012 ) . In short , pregnant mouse was euthanized at E12 . 5 after anesthesia by isoflurane and subsequent cervical dislocation . Embryos along with amniotic sacs were dissected and placed in ice-cold PBS . Spinal cords were dissected out of the embryos exposing ventral motoneuron columns . Ventral horns were dissected out by a scalpel and cultured on laminin ( Invitrogen #23017-15 ) coated coverslips in neurobasal medium ( catalog #21103-049; Invitrogen ) supplemented with B27 ( catalog #17504-044; Invitrogen ) , 600 \u03bcM/ml-glutamine ( catalog #25- 005-CI; Cellgro ) , BDNF ( 2 ng ml\u22121 ) , GDNF ( 2 ng ml\u22121 ) , CTNF ( 2 ng ml\u22121 ) , NGF ( 1 ng ml\u22121 ) ( Sigma ) , and penicillin-streptomycin ( catalog #30-003-CI; Cellgro ) . Every alternate day , half of the medium was replaced by freshly prepared medium . 6 days after plating , the explants are subjected to incubating with Slit2-conjugated beads ( see below ) . HEK293 cells were transfected with Flag-Slit2 or control empty Flag vector , to produce Flag-Slit2 and control conditioned media , respectively . Biotin-conjugated mouse monoclonal antibody ( 2 \u03bcl ) ( anti-Flag BioM2 , Sigma , F9291 ) was conjugated with 50 \u03bcl of FluoSpheres NeutrAvidin-labeled Microspheres ( 1 . 0 \u00b5m , red fluorescent [580/605] , F-8775 , Invitrogen ) by incubation in PBS for 4 hr at 4\u00b0C and then washed with ice-cold PBS , 3 times . Beads were re-suspended in 200 \u03bcl of ice-cold PBS with protease inhibitors and incubated with Flag-Slit2 or control conditioned media ( 200 \u03bcl ) overnight on a rotating shaker at 4\u00b0C . Flag-Slit2-conjugated neutravidin microspheres were isolated by spinning at 5000 rpm at 4\u00b0C . Microspheres were washed 3 times with ice-cold PBS and diluted in explant culture media ( 1:100 ) and incubated with spinal cord explants for 24 hr before analysis . Dorsal horn explants were fixed 4% ice-cold PFA for 20 min at room temperature and washed twice ( 5 min each ) with 1 ml PBS . Explants were then permeabilized by 1 ml blocking solution ( PBS with 0 . 3% Triton X-100 , 5% BSA , and 3% goat serum ) for 5 min at room temperature and incubated with primary antibodies in blocking solution for 2 days at 4\u00b0C . Explants were rinsed 3 times with 1 ml PBS , 5 min each , and incubated with secondary antibodies in blocking solution for 90 min at room temperature .

{"lay_summary": "The intestines , liver , and skin are all examples of organs that perform specific functions . Organs are comprised of tissues , which are themselves made up of cells . Epithelial tissue is one of the four basic types of tissue found in animals , and it occurs in almost every organ in the body . For example , epithelial tissue makes up the outermost layer of the skin , and the lining of the lungs and the intestines; the cells in epithelial tissues are attached to one another via \u2018adhesion molecules\u2019 . Organs and tissues need to be maintained throughout life in order for them to work properly . Epithelial cells in particular are very short-lived and must be constantly replaced . If epithelial tissue is cut or damaged in any way , the surrounding healthy epithelial cells must work together to repair the wound and restore the tissue's integrity . These processes require individual epithelial cells to communicate with one another . While chemical signals provide one means of cell-to-cell communication , cells also sense and respond to the physical presence of surrounding cells . In adults , organs and tissues generally do not change shape or size; as such there is a tightly balanced exchange of mechanical forces between the individual cells . Damage to the tissue causes a detectable change in these mechanical forces , which is sensed by nearby healthy epithelial cells and causes them to work towards healing the wound . While the importance of mechanical forces in maintaining tissue integrity is widely recognized , there were few tools to study these forces; this meant that mechanical communication through cell\u2013cell adhesion sites was not well understood . Now Ng , Besser et al . describe the development and use of a new method for measuring and mapping the exchange of mechanical forces at cell\u2013cell adhesion sites . Changes in the strength of the forces exchanged between cells could be measured across clusters of multiple cells or for specific parts of individual cells . Ng , Besser et al . found that when an epithelial cell in a cluster started to divide to form two new cells , the cell exerted less mechanical force on its neighboring cells . Ng , Besser et al . found that the forces exerted between cells were strongest when there was more of an adhesion molecule called E-cadherin in the cell surface membrane at the cell\u2013cell adhesion sites . The opposite was also true , as these forces were weakest at cell\u2013cell adhesion sites with fewer E-cadherin molecules . The new method and findings will now help to guide future studies into how mechanical forces are transmitted between living cells .", "article": "Force transduction at cell-cell adhesions regulates tissue development , maintenance and adaptation . We developed computational and experimental approaches to quantify , with both sub-cellular and multi-cellular resolution , the dynamics of force transmission in cell clusters . Applying this technology to spontaneously-forming adherent epithelial cell clusters , we found that basal force fluctuations were coupled to E-cadherin localization at the level of individual cell-cell junctions . At the multi-cellular scale , cell-cell force exchange depended on the cell position within a cluster , and was adaptive to reconfigurations due to cell divisions or positional rearrangements . Importantly , force transmission through a cell required coordinated modulation of cell-matrix adhesion and actomyosin contractility in the cell and its neighbors . These data provide insights into mechanisms that could control mechanical stress homeostasis in dynamic epithelial tissues , and highlight our methods as a resource for the study of mechanotransduction in cell-cell adhesions . \n Tissues undergo continuous rearrangements that require tightly balanced exchanges of mechanical forces between individual cells through cadherin-mediated cell\u2013cell junctions . The importance of mechanical coupling between cells has been documented for diverse multi-cellular processes , including tissue morphogenesis during development ( Mammoto and Ingber , 2010; Martin et al . , 2010; Rauzi et al . , 2010; Lecuit et al . , 2011; Weber et al . , 2012 ) , collective migration during wound healing ( Trepat et al . , 2009; Tambe et al . , 2011; Ng et al . , 2012 ) , epithelial and endothelial barrier functions ( Tzima et al . , 2005; Twiss et al . , 2012 ) , and cancer progression ( Friedl et al . , 2004; Bajpai et al . , 2009 ) . In all these processes , the spatiotemporal regulation of mechanical forces is essential for the maintenance of tissue integrity as well as for communication and coordination between cells . Nevertheless , it is yet unclear how the magnitude and length scale of cell\u2013cell force transmission are modulated dynamically as a function of cell position and topological changes within a cellular ensemble . Moreover , as recent studies have begun to characterize the molecular basis of the mechano-responsiveness of the cadherin\u2013catenin complex ( Gomez et al . , 2011; Leckband et al . , 2011 ) , it is important to understand how the recruitment and regulation of cadherin molecules at the adherens junctions are coupled to cell\u2013cell force transmission . To address these questions , an assay is required that can measure cell\u2013cell force transmission in situ and in time , which can be combined with high-resolution time-lapse imaging of protein recruitment and activity . We developed a method that utilizes high-resolution traction force microscopy ( TFM ) and time-lapse live cell microscopy to quantify cell\u2013cell mechanical interactions in dynamic multi-cellular clusters , while maintaining the sub-cellular resolution needed to measure force exchange at the level of individual junctions . Our method expanded upon several pioneering studies , which inferred cell\u2013cell force transmission from the regional imbalance of traction forces in cell pairs and three-cell clusters in linear configurations ( Liu et al . , 2010; Maruthamuthu et al . , 2011; McCain et al . , 2012; Tseng et al . , 2012 ) , by now providing the time and sub-cellular resolution needed to derive the spatiotemporal coordination of force exchanges in larger cell groups as well as the coupling of force and protein dynamics at individual adherens junctions . To achieve reconstruction of forces at individual cell\u2013cell junctions and in cell clusters of generic configurations , we incorporated the thin-plate modeling approach of cells and finite element analysis of the plate deformation that was utilized by other studies to infer intercellular interactions in entire cell sheets ( Trepat et al . , 2009; Tambe et al . , 2011 , 2013; Hur et al . , 2012 ) . Using this assay , we quantitatively mapped the forces transmitted through individual cell\u2013cell junctions of dynamic MCF10A epithelial cell clusters of various sizes and configurations over time . Our results revealed that the spatial distributions and dynamics of basal cell\u2013cell force transmission correlated with morphogenetic events such as cell divisions . Along the cell junction , we showed with sub-interface resolution that the local mechanical stresses also correlated with localization of E-cadherin molecules . Expanding our approach to temporal force fluctuation analysis at the length scale of a cell , we found that force propagation through cells can be intercepted by cell anchorage to the extracellular matrix and by actomyosin contraction . Together these results provide a first glimpse of the dynamics of sub-cellular force exchanges that yield stress homeostasis in quiescent and proliferating tissues . \n Our first step in implementing high-resolution quantification of cell\u2013cell forces built on the force-balancing principle was introduced in previous studies ( Liu et al . , 2010; Maruthamuthu et al . , 2011; McCain et al . , 2012 ) . The principle states that traction forces exerted by a single cell , or by a cluster of cells , are in mechanical equilibrium with the extracellular substrate . Hence , the traction forces integrated over the footprint of a single cell or a cell cluster must be equal to zero ( Figure 1; see \u2018The force-balancing principle and its application to larger cell clusters\u2019 in \u2018Materials and methods\u2019 section ) . Following from this , if the integrated traction force over the footprint of an individual cell within a cell cluster is non-zero , other cells in the cluster must balance it by force transmission through cell\u2013cell adhesions . Thus , the residual traction force for a particular cell within a cluster determines the vectorial sum of external forces this cell experiences through cell\u2013cell adhesions ( Equation 1 in \u2018Materials and methods\u2019 ) . In the case of a cell pair , each cell has one interface . Therefore , the residual forces associated with each of the two cells are\u2014within the noise limits of traction force reconstruction\u2014of equal magnitudes but opposite directions and indicate the force exchanged through that interface . 10 . 7554/eLife . 03282 . 003Figure 1 . Calculation of cell\u2013cell forces from traction forces . Single cells and cell clusters ( depicted in cartoon and graphical network representations for up to four cells , with areas \u03a91\u2013\u03a94 ) exert traction forces on the substrate ( red vectors; T\u21c0 ( x\u21c0 ) ) . Integration of traction forces over the footprint ( color-shaded boundaries ) of a single cell ( column 1 ) or an entire cell cluster ( columns 2\u20134 ) yields a balanced net force of 0 . In cell pairs and clusters with a \u2018tree-like\u2019 topology ( columns 2 and 3 ) , forces exchanged at each cell\u2013cell junction can be determined by partitioning the cluster into two sub-networks and calculating the residual force required to balance the traction forces integrated over the footprint of each sub-network . See \u2018Materials and methods\u2019 for details . In cell clusters with a \u2018loop\u2019 topology ( column 4 ) , individual cell\u2013cell junctions do not fully partition the cluster into disjoint sub-networks . In such cases , force transmission within a cell cluster can be calculated based on a model that describes the cluster as a thin-plate in mechanical equilibrium with the traction forces . The corresponding stress distribution inside the thin-plate is computed by the finite element method ( FEM ) . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 03282 . 003 Whereas previous studies examined cell clusters with two or at most three cells in a linear configuration ( Liu et al . , 2010; Maruthamuthu et al . , 2011; McCain et al . , 2012 ) , the force balancing principle readily expands to the calculation of cell\u2013cell forces in larger cell clusters with linear or \u2018tree-like\u2019 topologies ( Figure 1 ) . To determine the neighborhood topology of cells , we defined a cell cluster as a graphical network , where each cell is represented as a node and each junction between two cells is represented by an edge connecting two nodes of the network . In a \u2018tree-like\u2019 topology , removal of any of the graphical edges results in two completely disjointed sub-networks . In this case , the forces at any cell\u2013cell interface can be determined by calculating the residual forces over the cellular footprints defined by the two sub-networks ( Figure 1; for details , see \u2018The force-balancing principle and its application to larger cell clusters\u2019 in \u2018Materials and methods\u2019 section ) . Statistical analyses of our experimental data indicate that the median error of force calculations based on the force-balancing principle was \u223c14% of the expected force magnitudes ( Figure 2 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 03282 . 004Figure 2 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 03282 . 004 Cell clusters may also adopt a \u2018loop\u2019 topology . In such \u2018loop\u2019 clusters , removal of single graphical edges no longer yields disjointed sub-networks ( Figure 1 ) . This means that cell\u2013cell junctions are configured in a mechanically redundant system , and the forces exchanged at each junction cannot be simply resolved using the force-balancing principle . To resolve the relative contributions of redundant junctions to the force balance in cell clusters with a \u2018loop\u2019 topology , we modeled the cell cluster as a thin-plate in mechanical equilibrium with the substrate . Following the work by Fredberg and colleagues , we performed these calculations under the assumption that the plate is homogeneously elastic ( for details , see \u2018Assumptions for the thin-plate FEM approach\u2019 in \u2018Materials and methods\u2019 section ) ( Tambe et al . , 2011 , 2013 ) . Using the finite element method ( FEM ) , we then determined the thin-plate internal stresses that are required to balance the traction stresses in the substrate . Once the thin-plate internal stresses are known , the local force exchange through any curvilinear section inside the plate can be calculated by multiplication of the stress tensor at a particular location on the section with the normal vector to the section line ( Figure 3A ) . In our experiments , the curvilinear sections were defined by the fluorescence signals of GFP fused to E-cadherin , the molecular backbone of adherens junctions in epithelial tissues ( Halbleib and Nelson , 2006 ) . Thus we could calculate force exchange profiles along cell\u2013cell interfaces ( Figure 3A ) at any time point of a time-lapse video ( Video 1 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 03282 . 005Figure 3 .

Sign-inverted traction forces ( green vectors ) are applied to the thin-plate model to generate an internal stress distribution of cells 1 and 2 that is consistent with the measured traction forces ( red vectors ) . The internal stress distribution is then used to calculate the force profile along the cell\u2013cell interface a1 , 2 ( blue vectors ) .

Force exchange between E-cadherin-GFP-expressing MCF10A cell pair quantified at sub-junctional resolution using FEM; related to Figure 3A . Measured traction stresses ( green vectors ) were inverted for the calculation of mechanical stress distribution within the cell pair based on the thin-plate model , and the calculated cell internal stresses were integrated along the cell\u2013cell junction to obtain the transmitted cell\u2013cell stress profile along the junction ( blue vectors; see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019 for details ) .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 03282 . 007 We tested the validity of the thin-plate model in cell clusters with a \u2018tree-like\u2019 topology , where the force exchange at cell\u2013cell interfaces could be determined both by the force-balancing approach and integration of the FEM-predicted stress profile along the same interface ( Figure 1 ) . Our analyses indicated that both approaches yielded consistent results; the error for interface force calculations by the FEM approach is comparable to the error we found for force calculations by the force balancing principle alone ( Figure 2 ) . This implies that the inaccuracy in FEM-predicted forces arises from the same sources of error as the inaccuracy in force balance-predicted forces , which are uncertainties in the traction force reconstruction . Thus , neither the simplifying approximation of the cell cluster by a homogeneous thin-plate nor the numerical solution of the model introduced substantial error when predicting cell\u2013cell forces in \u2018tree-like\u2019 topologies . Although both the force-balancing-principle approach and the FEM approach appeared to have similar accuracy in determining cell\u2013cell forces , application of the thin-plate model permits the analysis of force exchange in clusters that change between a \u2018tree-like\u2019 and a \u2018loop\u2019 topology ( Figure 3C and Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B vs Figure 3B and Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A; Videos 2 and 3 ) and is thus a more generalized approach to quantify cell\u2013cell force transmission . 10 . 7554/eLife . 03282 . 008Video 2 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 03282 . 009 We first applied our generalized method to study the dynamics and patterns of cell\u2013cell adhesion forces in naturally formed clusters of MCF10A epithelial cells in 2D adherent cultures , including clusters that were undergoing cell divisions ( Figure 4A\u2013C; Video 4 ) . Cell proliferation is an important factor in regulating the tensional homeostasis of tissues ( Farhadifar et al . , 2007; Ranft et al . , 2010; Eisenhoffer et al . , 2012 ) , and the process itself is finely coordinated by intracellular and extracellular forces ( Th\u00e9ry et al . , 2007; Woolner and Papalopulu , 2012 ) . We found that , as a cell in a cluster entered mitosis , the overall mechanical energy deposited into the substrate by either the entire cluster or the dividing cell transiently decreased ( Figure 4D\u2013E ) . The overall mechanical energy generated by a cluster or individual cells therein was calculated as the strain energy , that is , the product of traction force and substrate deformation , integrated over the footprint of a cluster or a cell . The drop in strain energy during mitosis reflected the detachment of the dividing cell from the cell\u2013matrix as it became rounded ( Video 4 ) , consistent with previous assertions ( Terasima and Tolmach , 1963; Burton and Taylor , 1997; Tanimoto and Sano , 2012 ) . After mitosis , the strain energy was restored and , in this example , increased beyond pre-mitotic levels ( Figure 4D ) , possibly reflecting the additional contractility that the new cell contributed to the cluster . 10 . 7554/eLife . 03282 . 010Figure 4 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 03282 . 012 Each mitotic event correlated with a dramatic decrease in the forces , which the dividing cell exchanged with its neighbors ( Figure 4F\u2013H ) , suggesting that mitosis is accompanied by weakening of not only cell\u2013matrix adhesions but also cell\u2013cell adhesions . Interestingly , during mitotic events , the sum of cell\u2013cell force magnitudes over all junctions in the cell cluster remained constant before increasing to a higher plateau value ( Figure 4I ) . This suggested that the loss of cell\u2013cell forces at the junctions of the dividing cell was balanced at other junctions in the cluster ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . For example , during division of cell 1 in Figure 4A\u2013B , the two connecting graphical edges , edges 1 and 2 , exhibited decreases in cell\u2013cell forces ( Figure 4F ) . In contrast , edge 5 , which was not directly connected to cell 1 , experienced an increase in force transmission ( Figure 4G; Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . Similarly , during the division of cell 3 ( Figure 4B\u2013C ) , there was an increase in cell\u2013cell force at edge 6 ( Figure 4F; Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1 ) , which was not connected to the dividing cell . These results show that , during major morphological changes , force fluctuations at individual cell\u2013cell junctions can be dynamically compensated by forces at other cell junctions . Our time-resolved force measurements demonstrated that cell\u2013cell forces at individual junctions fluctuate over time , both during interphase and cell divisions . We thus investigated whether and how basal force variations were coupled to the localization and recruitment of the molecular components of cell\u2013cell junctions . We focused first on E-cadherin , the backbone of adherens junctions for epithelial cells . We correlated the E-cadherin-GFP intensities integrated along each cell\u2013cell junction with the force measured for each junction and observed a positive and statistically significant correlation ( Figure 5A ) . The positive correlation also persisted on a stiffer matrix ( Figure 5A ) , indicating that the overall relation between force exchange and E-cadherin recruitment is robust and independent of substrate compliance . We further validated the central role of cadherin proteins in mediating cell\u2013cell force transmission by using function-blocking antibodies targeting E-cadherin directly ( Petrova et al . , 2012 ) or by knock-down of alpha-catenin , an essential adaptor protein of cadherin-mediated adhesions ( Yonemura et al . , 2010 ) . Both perturbations resulted in a significant reduction in cell\u2013cell force measurements ( Figure 5B\u2013C ) . These results support the model that the junctional recruitment of E-cadherin is coupled to the cell\u2013cell adhesion forces ( Liu et al . , 2010; Borghi et al . , 2012 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 03282 . 013Figure 5 .

This suggested that the coupling of force and E-cadherin recruitment observed at the level of entire cell\u2013cell junctions could be translated to a sub-junctional length scale . Indeed , this visual impression could be confirmed quantitatively by a positive and statistically significant correlation between local E-cadherin-GFP intensities and cell\u2013cell stress measurements ( Figure 6B ) , both on soft and stiff substrates . 10 . 7554/eLife . 03282 . 014Figure 6 .

As the segment length increased , the randomization abrogated the positive correlation between cell\u2013cell stress distribution and local E-cadherin-GFP intensities , as indicated by the decreasing ratio between correlation coefficients with and without randomization ( Figure 6C , red curve ) . We defined the segment length at which the ratio between correlation coefficients with and without randomization fell below 0 . 5 as the length scale over which force exchange between cells and E-cadherin recruitment are coupled . We found this length to be 9 . 6 \u00b5m ( Figure 6C ) or 12 . 8 \u00b5m ( Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A ) depending on whether the cells were cultured on soft ( 8 kPa ) or stiff ( 35 kPa ) substrates . This length scale is consistent with the length scale over which E-cadherin-GFP proteins are modulated along cell\u2013cell junctions in our system , which we measured to be 13 \u00b5m based on autocorrelation of E-cadherin-GFP intensities along the cell junctions ( Figure 6D; Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1B ) . Similar values of cadherin intensity fluctuations along cell junctions have previously been reported for mature cell\u2013cell adhesions ( Lambert et al . , 2007 ) . Thus , our results suggest that the measured length scale of force\u2013E-cadherin coupling is likely related to the spatial organization of E-cadherin along the cell\u2013cell junctions and not a resolution limit of the FEM analysis . Importantly , the value \u223c10 \u03bcm is significantly less than the length of the majority of the cell\u2013cell junctions in the MCF10A clusters ( Figure 6E; Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1C ) . Even for junctions less than or equal to 10 \u00b5m , we were able to detect cell\u2013cell stresses . In fact , the distribution of cell\u2013cell stress magnitudes for these short junctions is similar to that for junctions of all lengths , indicating that our analysis of cell\u2013cell stress is not limited by cell junction lengths ( Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . Together , these analyses demonstrate that the FEM approach is able to extract significant sub-junctional variations in cell\u2013cell adhesion forces . We also noted that for segments >40 \u00b5m , the correlation between local E-cadherin-GFP intensities and cell\u2013cell stress measurements dramatically increased ( Figure 6C , black curve ) . Since segments of this length could only be defined in extended , more mature cell\u2013cell junctions ( Figure 6E ) , we suspected that this trend could reflect a particular property of this more stable population of cell interfaces within the clusters . We therefore repeated the correlation analysis for bins containing junctions of increasing length . Indeed , we found that the median as well as the entire distribution of correlations between local cell\u2013cell stress magnitudes and E-cadherin-GFP intensities increased with junction length ( Figure 6F; Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1D ) . Importantly , although the number of junctions per bin decreased with length , the correlation increase is not related to weaker statistical power because randomization abrogated the trend ( Figure 6G; Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1E ) . These results are consistent with more qualitative reports that mechanical forces exerted by actomyosin contractility are critical for junction growth and maturation ( Shewan et al . , 2005; Yamada and Nelson , 2007; Borghi et al . , 2012; Brieher and Yap , 2013 ) . Our measurements of cell\u2013cell force fluctuations during mitosis also revealed spatial patterns of force transduction between multiple connected cells . When junctions were re-established after mitosis , those embedded in the cell cluster had lower force transmission compared to junctions at the cluster periphery ( network in Figure 4C; Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B ) . To further examine the spatial distribution of cell\u2013cell forces , we categorized each cell in a cell cluster by the number of its neighbors or its degree of connectivity ( k ) ( Figure 1 ) . With increasing k , the sum of cell\u2013cell forces increased ( Figure 7A ) , which indicates that the cumulative force a cell experiences through its cell\u2013cell adhesions increases with the number of connected neighbors . Strikingly , the increase in cumulative cell\u2013cell forces for higher k-values was not paralleled by stronger cell\u2013matrix traction forces ( Figure 7B ) . Thus , contrary to the conclusions drawn from examining cell doublets ( Maruthamuthu et al . , 2011 ) , the generation and exchange of forces at cell\u2013cell junctions can be decoupled from cell\u2013matrix traction force generation , especially in larger cell clusters where cells have higher k values . This result is further supported by the observation that focal adhesions and traction forces are primarily localized at the periphery of cell clusters ( Figure 8 ) , consistent with a previous report ( Mertz et al . , 2013 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 03282 . 017Figure 7 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 03282 . 018 Although cell\u2013matrix traction might not be directly coupled to cell\u2013cell force transmission , it did nevertheless affect the distribution of cell\u2013cell forces in cell clusters . We examined the forces transmitted through individual cell\u2013cell junctions by assigning each junction , or graphical edge , the two k values of the two cells it connected . The cell\u2013cell junctions were then grouped according to the lesser of the two k values ( minimal k ) . Junctions with smaller minimal k values were closer to the cluster periphery , whereas those with higher minimal k were embedded in the cluster . In general , cells on stiffer ( 35 kPa ) substrates exerted higher traction forces compared to cells on softer ( 8 kPa ) substrates ( Figure 7B ) . Interestingly , the dependence of traction force on matrix compliance was reflected in different trends of force transmission vs minimal k . On 8 kPa substrates , cell\u2013cell forces at individual junctions were independent of the minimal k values ( Figure 7C ) , whereas the cell\u2013cell stresses , calculated by normalizing cell\u2013cell force to junction length , increased for junctions with higher minimal k values ( Figure 7D ) . This is consistent with a previous analysis of cellular stresses in epithelial sheets , in which the stresses exerted between cells were proposed to be higher towards the center of the sheet ( Trepat et al . , 2009 ) . In contrast , on 35 kPa substrates , the forces as well as stresses exerted on individual cell\u2013cell junctions decreased with increasing minimal k of the junction ( Figure 7C\u2013D ) . Hence , for cell clusters on the stiffer substrate , the cell\u2013cell forces were transmitted predominantly between cluster-peripheral cells and not across the cluster center . Thus , the spatial pattern of cell\u2013cell force transmission is modulated by the mechanical microenvironment . To obtain further insight into the spatial organization of cell\u2013cell forces , we investigated the dynamic transmission of forces through cells . We performed pairwise cross-correlation analyses of forces between opposing cell\u2013cell junctions and between forces at cell\u2013cell junctions and cell\u2013matrix adhesions ( Figure 9A; see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019 section ) . This analysis is based on the following expectations of cell mechanics: if forces are transmitted across a cell without coupling to cell\u2013matrix adhesions , the forces at the two considered junctions should fluctuate with similar magnitudes and opposite directions ( correlation close to \u22121 ) , whereas the fluctuations of cell\u2013cell and cell\u2013matrix forces should not be correlated ( correlation close to 0 ) . The opposite is true if forces exerted at one cell\u2013cell junction are not transmitted across a cell but instead are transmitted to the cell substrate . 10 . 7554/eLife . 03282 . 019Figure 9 . Dynamic force transmission through cells . ( A ) Schematic of temporal cross-correlation analysis of force fluctuations at opposing cell\u2013cell junctions . To determine the extent of force transmission from one cell\u2013cell junction across a cell ( depicted here in red ) to the next junction or to the cell substrate , force fluctuations at one cell\u2013cell interface i of the cell-of-interest are correlated with the fluctuations of the vector sum of cell\u2013cell forces at all remaining cell\u2013cell junctions of this cell or with the fluctuations of the negative residual traction force of the cell , respectively .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 03282 . 020 For control MCF10A cells , the coupling between cell\u2013cell forces and cell\u2013matrix was stronger than the coupling between cell\u2013cell forces at opposing cell junctions , irrespective of substrate stiffness ( Figure 9B ) , indicating that forces exerted at cell\u2013cell junctions were only weakly transmitted through a cell . At first , this result seemed to contradict findings that , in processes such as collective migration , mechanical interactions are long-ranged relative to the dimension of a single cell ( Trepat et al . , 2009 ) . However , our data could be reconciled with this observation if long-range force transmission is an active process: forces exerted on a cell activate signaling pathways and contractile machineries that are responsible for transducing force to neighboring cells . In this model , each individual cell in a cell cluster , though linked with one another , functions independently with the ability to promote or attenuate force transduction . There are two non-exclusive mechanisms that could attenuate force transduction across individual cells: first , forces at cell\u2013cell junctions may be transmitted to the substrate via cell\u2013matrix adhesions , thus intercepting the mechanical link between opposing cell\u2013cell junctions ( \u2018force anchoring mechanism\u2019 ) . Second , each cell may have a basal actomyosin contractility level that is autonomous from extracellular force stimuli and high enough to overcome the cell-external forces ( \u2018force scrambling mechanism\u2019 ) . To examine these two possibilities , we measured cell\u2013cell force transduction in mosaic cell clusters , where control cells were intermixed with cells in which paxillin , talin-1 , or myosin-IIA were downregulated ( Figure 9; Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . Both paxillin and talin-1 are proteins involved in the assembly and maturation of integrin adhesions and the generation of traction forces ( Zaidel-Bar et al . , 2004; Zhang et al . , 2008; Iwanicki et al . , 2011 ) . Therefore , we expected cells with downregulated paxillin or talin-1 to be mechanically isolated from the substrate . Indeed , the traction forces exerted by cells with reduced paxillin or talin-1 were significantly lower than the traction forces of control cells ( Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 1D , H ) . In cell pairs in which both cells had paxillin downregulated , forces at the cell\u2013cell junction were unchanged compared to control cell pairs , indicating that paxillin knock-down did not affect cell\u2013cell force transmission ( Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 1C ) . In talin-1-downregulated cell pairs , although cell\u2013cell forces were lower than those of control cell pairs , cell\u2013cell junction morphology was unaffected , and cell\u2013cell force transmission was restored almost to control levels when the talin-1 downregulated cells were embedded in larger clusters ( Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 1F , G , M ) . Importantly , the correlation between the fluctuations of cell\u2013cell forces in opposing junctions of a paxillin or talin-1 downregulated cell was higher than that between the cell\u2013cell force fluctuations in opposing junctions of control cells ( Figure 9B ) . For talin-1 downregulated cells , which exert very low traction forces ( Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 1H ) , the correlation between the fluctuations of cell\u2013cell forces in opposing junctions was in addition higher than that between the cell\u2013cell force and traction force fluctuations ( Figure 9B , D\u2013E; Video 5 ) . These data showed that the decoupling from the matrix of a cell within a cluster promotes the transmission of forces across the cell , from one cell\u2013cell junction to the next , in support of the force anchoring mechanism as one way a cell may attenuate long-range force transmission . 10 . 7554/eLife . 03282 . 021Video 5 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 03282 . 021 The force scrambling mechanism was tested in mosaic cell clusters in which myosin-IIA , an isoform of the non-muscle myosin-II motor protein responsible for generating cell contractility ( Cai et al . , 2010 ) , was downregulated in one or more cells . In cell pairs in which both cells had downregulated myosin-IIA , the traction forces exerted by the cells , as well as the forces exerted through the cell\u2013cell junctions , were significantly decreased ( Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 1K\u2013L ) . Although myosin-IIA downregulation affected cell\u2013cell and cell\u2013matrix mechanotransduction , cell\u2013cell junctions were still able to form in cell clusters , as the cell\u2013cell junction morphology of myosin-IIA downregulated cells remained similar to control cells and cells with downregulated myosin-IIA exerted forces at their cell\u2013cell junctions close to control levels when embedded in larger clusters ( Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 1J , N ) . As with talin-1 downregulated cells , cells with myosin-IIA knock-down showed a significant increase in the correlation of force fluctuations at opposing junctions compared to control cells ( Figure 9B ) . This shows that cells with reduced actomyosin contractility act as passive force transducers between other contractile cells in a cluster , consistent with the force scrambling mechanism . \n Using our generalized cell\u2013cell force measurement and analysis method , we quantified , spatially and temporally , the transmission of mechanical forces through cell\u2013cell junctions of dynamic adherent epithelial clusters . Combined with image analyses of cell\u2013cell junction configurations and rearrangements in the living cell clusters , our data provided unprecedented statistical power and time resolution to address questions regarding force distributions and fluctuations within cell clusters , as well as their coupling to the recruitment of molecular components of adherens junctions ( Maruthamuthu et al . , 2011 ) . To our knowledge , the proposed method is the first to resolve cell\u2013cell force transmission dynamically with sub-cellular resolution . Yet , there are limitations that need to be considered with re-implementations of the approach: first , our method relies on a simple thin-plate model of the cell cluster that assumes homogeneity in material property within the cluster . In reality , the mechanical properties of the cell cluster may not be linear and isotropic elastic , as there may be spatial heterogeneity arising from differences in sub-cellular structures and cellular contractility . The assumption of mechanical homogeneity has been made also in stress distribution analyses on an entire cell monolayer ( Tambe et al . , 2013 ) . In that case , the low spatial resolution tends to average inhomogeneity . The higher the resolution in imaging and the finer the spatial scale of the FEM analysis , the less likely is the cell cluster well represented by a thin-plate . How severe the resulting prediction error is depends on the cluster configuration and the noise level in the traction forces . In the present study , we validated the resolution of the inferred cell\u2013cell forces by cross-correlation analysis of the spatial force fluctuations with E-cadherin density fluctuations along the junctions . These tests confirmed that despite the simple thin-plate model , cell\u2013cell forces are resolved at the length scale E-cadherin-GFP intensities that fluctuate along the cell junction ( Figure 6 ) . We therefore conclude that the model simplifications are in this case not severe enough to obscure spatial relationships between force and underlying molecular processes in cell junctions . Second , our method relies on E-cadherin-GFP signals for determining the location of cell\u2013cell junctions . Imaging resolutions ( lateral and axial ) as well as diffuse signals in dynamic junctions may affect the precision of determining the cell\u2013cell boundary locations and therefore the accuracy of cell\u2013cell force calculations . Third , the method relies on enclosure of the entire cluster in the field of view . Without tiling the image acquisition , the cluster size is therefore limited to a maximum of 8\u201310 cells . It is important to note that increasing cluster size would also increase the error of force measurement , as the error of traction force microscopy sums up during the calculation of cell\u2013cell forces . Thus for detailed analyses of small relative force variations in space and time , it is advised to restrict the cluster size . We have quantified cell\u2013cell force dynamics in naturally forming clusters of up to nine MCF10A cells . Lastly , because the method derives cell\u2013cell forces indirectly through measurement of cell\u2013matrix traction forces , a fundamental assumption is that the measured traction forces fully capture all forces produced by the cells . Thus , the method implicitly neglects the dissipation of forces inside cells , which\u2014in principle\u2014may affect cell\u2013cell junctional forces . However , experiments that attempted to determine the magnitude of dissipative forces suggest that these contributions may be small compared to the elastic forces analyzed by the present approach ( Keren et al . , 2009 ) . One key observation we made is that , at the multi-cellular level , junctional force distributions fluctuate temporally and spatially in response to local variations in cell\u2013matrix adhesions and cellular contractility . Although tissue reorganization has long been known as mechanically regulated , our method provides now the capability to monitor the dynamics of cell\u2013cell junctional force exchanges during various morphogenetic events and thus the ability to correlate the induction and outcome of processes such as cell polarization ( Blankenship et al . , 2006 ) , mitotic spindle orientation ( Fink et al . , 2011 ) , cell migration ( Toyama et al . , 2008 ) , and cell sorting ( Landsberg et al . , 2009 ) , not only with putative surrogates of force generation ( e . g . , myosin-II localization ) but also with actual force values . We show that mechanical forces may be balanced during major topology-changing events such as cell division by dynamic redistribution of cell\u2013cell junctional forces within small cell clusters ( Figure 4 ) . The result suggests that force fluctuations at individual cell\u2013cell junctions can be dynamically compensated by forces at other cell junctions . We speculate that this type of mechanical compensation occurs during cell division\u2014and apoptosis\u2014within larger tissues as well and may be the basis of tissue stress homeostasis to maintain mechanical integrity in a proliferating and deforming epithelium . Our method also provides insights into tissue mechanics by revealing that force transmission across a cell cluster is short-ranged , typically on the length scale of one cell diameter , due to the anchoring and scrambling of forces by cell\u2013matrix adhesions and basal actomyosin contractility ( Figure 9 ) . The longer-range force transmission previously observed and required for tissue morphogenesis processes , such as collective cell migration ( Tambe et al . , 2011 ) , is possible by the active regulation of force propagation . This can be accomplished by spatially coordinating the activation of actomyosin contractility above basal force levels , which yields a significant force exchange between neighboring cells , or by spatially coordinating the de-activation of actomyosin contractility and/or cell\u2013matrix adhesion , which may increase the transduction range of basal force levels beyond one cell diameter . The notion of active propagation of mechanical forces across tissues via spatial gradients in myosin-II activation is supported by studies of epithelial sheet migration ( Ng et al . , 2012 ) and collective invasion of cancer cell clusters ( Hidalgo-Carcedo et al . , 2011 ) , in which an asymmetric distribution of actomyosin contractility promote cell cohesion . Based on our statistical analysis of over 90 cell clusters and over 250 cell\u2013cell junctions in these clusters , it appeared that intercellular force transmission exhibits distinct spatial patterns in clusters cultured on soft vs stiff substrates , in which cell\u2013cell forces are transmitted along cluster peripheral cells on stiff substrates , but through the cluster center on soft substrates ( Figure 7 ) . We speculate that this may also be a result of the active interplay between cell\u2013cell adhesions , cell\u2013matrix adhesions , and basal actomyosin contractility to transmit , anchor , and scramble forces . As previously reported by the Dufresne group ( Mertz et al . , 2012 , 2013 ) and shown here in Figure 7 and Figure 8 , focal adhesion numbers and traction force magnitudes are higher along the outer periphery of the cluster , suggesting that cell\u2013cell forces are derived from cell\u2013matrix forces that occur mainly at the cluster periphery . On stiffer substrates , where actomyosin contractility and traction force exertion are known to be high ( Discher et al . , 2005 ) , the force anchoring and scrambling mechanisms are likely more active , preventing force transmission to the center of the cluster , whereas on softer substrates such mechanisms are less active , allowing force propagation through the cluster center . Although it is yet unclear how substrate stiffness precisely regulates cell\u2013matrix adhesions , the cytoskeletal network , and traction force exertion in cell clusters , it has been shown that the differences induced by substrate stiffness can extend multiple cell layers into a cell sheet ( Ng et al . , 2012 ) . Understanding how microenvironmental mechanical properties influence force transduction in epithelial cell groups may have implications not only for developmental processes but also for pathologies such as cancer where matrix stiffness is often altered ( Paszek et al . , 2005 ) . Lastly , our cell\u2013cell force microscopy method allowed us to correlate , in quantitative terms , cell\u2013cell force transmission to intracellular molecular dynamics . We showed that , at the sub-cellular level , the variations in junctional forces can be coupled to turnover of E-cadherin-GFP at the junctions . Future studies can apply the same approach for analyses of other cell\u2013cell junction molecules , including known force-responsive proteins , such as alpha-catenin ( Yonemura et al . , 2010 ) , vinculin ( le Duc et al . , 2010; Huveneers et al . , 2012; Thomas et al . , 2013 ) , and Eplin ( Abe and Takeichi , 2008; Taguchi et al . , 2011 ) . With temporal and spatial resolutions at both the sub-cellular and multi-cellular levels , our method represents a tested toolkit for systematic investigation of the complex force homeostatic mechanisms required for the maintenance of a stress-resistant tissue . \n MCF10A expressing E-cadherin-GFP were generated by retroviral infection with LZBOB-neo-E-cadherin-GFP expression vector ( gift of MJ Wheelock and AB Reynolds ( Fukumoto et al . , 2008 ) ) and selected with neomyocin ( 300 \u00b5g/ml ) . For experiments with mosaic cell clusters containing control cells intermixed with cells with knock-down of myosin-IIA or talin-1 , MCF10A-E-cadherin-GFP cells that also expressed H2B-mCherry were used , such that the nuclear marker could serve to distinguish between the control and the knock-down cells . MCF10A-E-cadherin-GFP cells that also expressed H2B-mCherry were generated by infection with the pBabe-H2B-mCherry retroviral vector and selected with hygromycin ( 300 \u00b5g/ml ) . All MCF10A cells were maintained in DMEM/F12 media supplemented with 5% horse serum , 20 ng/ml EGF , 0 . 5 mg/ml hydrocortisone , 100 ng/ml cholera toxin , 10 \u00b5g/ml insulin , and 1\u00d7 penicillin/streptomycin , as described previously ( http://brugge . med . harvard . edu/protocols ) ( Debnath et al . , 2003 ) . In experiments where antibodies were used to perturb E-cadherin-mediated cell\u2013cell adhesions , MCF10A-E-cadherin-GFP cells were treated with 3 \u00b5g/ml of neutral , control antibody ( 76D5; gift of BM Gumbiner ( Petrova et al . , 2012 ) ) , or E-cadherin-blocking antibody ( DECMA-1; Abcam ) for at least 2 hr prior to TFM measurements . As an additional control , cells were also imaged and measured pre-treatment . In immunostaining experiments to visualize focal adhesions in MCF10A-E-cadherin-GFP cell clusters , a purified mouse anti-paxillin antibody ( BD Biosciences , San Jose , CA ) was used as the primary antibody and the Alexa Fluor 568 goat anti-mouse antibody ( Life Technologies , Grand Island , NY ) was used as the secondary antibody . Downregulation of alpha-catenin in MCF10A-E-cadherin-GFP cells was achieved by transient transfection of the cells with a pool of four small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) duplexes targeting human CTNNA1 ( M-010505-01; Dharmacon , Lafayette , CO ) . Downregulation of talin-1 in MCF10A-E-cadherin-GFP or MCF10A-E-cadherin-GFP-H2B-mCherry cells was achieved by transient transfection of the cells with a pool of four siRNA duplexes targeting human talin-1 ( M-012949-00; Dharmacon ) . Transient transfections were performed as described previously ( Simpson et al . , 2008 ) , with 25 nM of siRNA and the DharmaFECT 3 transfection reagent ( Dharmacon ) . Experiments were conducted for 48\u201372 hr after transfection . Downregulation of myosin-IIA in MCF10A-E-cadherin-GFP or MCF10A-E-cadherin-GFP-H2B-mCherry cells was achieved by lentiviral infection of a short-hairpin RNA ( shRNA ) plasmid containing non-muscle myosin IIA ( Open Biosystems , Huntsville , AL ) . Two shRNA sequences were tested separately: sequence 1: 5\u2032-CCGG-GACAGCAATCTGTACCGCATT-CTCGAG-AATGCGGTACAGATTGCTGTC-TTTTT-3\u2032 ( TRCN0000029466 ) and sequence 2: 5\u2032-CCGG-CCGCGAAGTCAGCTCCCTAAA-CTCGAG-TTTAGGGAGCTGACTTCGCGG-TTTTT-3\u2032 ( TRCN0000029467 ) . Stably infected cells were selected with puromycin ( 2 \u00b5g/ml ) . Experiments were conducted 48\u201372 hr after transfection . Knock-down of alpha-catenin , talin-1 , and myosin-IIA was confirmed by immunoblotting per standard protocols and probed with antibodies against alpha-catenin ( Sigma , St . Louis , MO ) , talin-1 ( Cell Signaling , Danvers , MA ) , and myosin-IIA ( Covance , Dedham , MA ) , respectively . At least two independent experiments were conducted for each condition . Fibronectin-coated PAA gels containing 0 . 2 \u03bcm fluorescent microspheres ( Life Technologies ) were prepared on glass-bottomed dishes , as described previously ( Pelham and Wang , 1997 ) . In brief , the glass surfaces were incubated with 0 . 1 N NaOH and air-dried . The surfaces were then incubated with 3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane ( Sigma ) and 0 . 5% glutaraldehyde ( Sigma ) , and washed with distilled H2O in between incubations . After drying , a drop of acrylamide/bis-acrylamide solution containing ammonium persulfate ( BioRad , Hercules , CA ) , tetramethylethylenediamine ( TEMED; Sigma ) , and 0 . 2 \u03bcm fluorescent microspheres was pipetted onto the modified glass surface . A coverslip was placed over the droplets to ensure a flat gel surface after polymerization . 10 \u00b5g/ml of fibronectin was coupled to the PAA substrates via the bi-functional crosslinker sulfosuccinimidyl hexanoate ( sulfo-SANPAH; Pierce Biotechnology , Rockford , IL ) . Gels with elastic moduli of 8 kPa and 35 kPa were generated with acrylamide/bis-acrylamide ratios of 5%/0 . 3% and 10%/0 . 2% , respectively . The elastic moduli were measured using a rheometer ( AR-G2; TA Instruments , New Castle , DE ) . To accommodate fluorescent imaging with GFP and mCherry markers in cells , dark red fluorescent beads ( 660/680; Life Technologies ) were used , at a final concentration of 0 . 0032% by volume . Cells on PAA substrates were imaged with a multispectral multimode spinning disk confocal microscope consisting of a Nikon Ti-E inverted motorized microscope equipped with a custom built 37\u00b0C microscope incubator enclosure with 5% CO2 delivery , an integrated Perfect Focus System , a 40\u00d7 0 . 95NA Plan Apo objective , a Yokogawa CSU-X1 spinning disk confocal head with internal motorized high speed emission filter wheel and Spectral Applied Research Borealis modification for increased light throughput and illumination homogeneity , and a Hamamatsu ORCA-AG cooled CCD camera . GFP , mCherry , and dark red bead fluorescence were excited with the 491 nm , 561 nm , and 642 nm lasers , respectively , and collected with a quad 405/488/561/647 dichroic mirror ( Semrock , Rochester , NY ) and a 525/50 , 620/60 , or 700/75 emission filter ( Chroma , Bellows Falls , VT ) . Images were acquired at the focal plane where the top-most layer of fluorescence beads was in focus , which also corresponded with the bottom-most part of the cells as visualized by E-cadherin-GFP . Images were acquired with MetaMorph software ( MDS Analytical Technologies , Sunnyvale , CA ) . Cells were trypsinized with 0 . 25% trypsin after imaging to obtain a reference frame of unstrained bead positions . For calculation of traction forces , square image blocks with a template size of 15\u201325 pixels = 2 . 5\u20134 . 1 \u00b5m ( where the smaller template sizes were applied on the stiff 35 kPa substrates ) were centered on each reference bead position , identified as intensity maxima in the reference frame . Bead displacements were defined as the x\u2013y shift maximizing the cross-correlation score of these image blocks in a corresponding region of the deformed bead image . To minimize false positive template matching , bead displacements with insignificant maxima in the cross-correlation score function were rejected ( for details see: Ji and Danuser , 2005 ) . Traction forces were reconstructed from the bead displacements using an implementation of the regularized Fourier Transform Traction Cytometry ( FTTC ) method ( Butler et al . , 2002 ) provided by Sabass et al . ( 2008 ) . The method is based on the assumption that the PAA substrate can be regarded as an isotropic , linear elastic , infinite half-space . This allows a closed-form formulation of the relationship between traction forces and substrate deformation using the Boussinesq Green function ( Landau and Lifshitz , 1970 ) . In order to solve the ill-posed inversion problem , we applied zero-order Tikhonov regularization ( Schwarz et al . , 2002; Sabass et al . , 2008 ) . The regularization parameter \u03bb2 ranged from 5 \u00d7 10\u22128 to 10\u22126 . The smaller values were used for the data on 35 kPa . The force-balancing principle dictates that , in the absence of significant inertial and frictional forces from the cell microenvironment , the traction forces exerted by an adherent cell must be balanced by the cell substrate . Extending this argument beyond single cells , a cell cluster and its substrate must also be in mechanical equilibrium . The integration of the traction force ( and also torque ) over the footprint \u03a9c of the cell cluster thus has to equal zero ( Figure 1; Equation 1 ) . The net traction force over the whole-cell cluster must also equal the sum of the traction forces integrated over the footprint of each individual cell . For example , in the case of a two-cell cluster with cells i and j , the net traction force of the cell pair , which should be zero , will equal the sum of traction forces integrated over the footprints of each of the two cells ( \u03a9i and \u03a9j ) . ( 1 ) \u222b\u03a9cT\u21c0 ( x\u21c0 ) dx\u21c0=0=\u222b\u03a9iT\u21c0 ( x\u21c0 ) dx\u21c0+\u222b\u03a9jT\u21c0 ( x\u21c0 ) dx\u21c0 Here , T\u21c0 denotes the traction stress exerted by the cells . In general , cells within a cluster all exert traction forces on the cell substrate . Thus , the integrated traction force for each individual cell within the cluster is non-zero ( i . e . , \u222b\u03a9iT\u21c0 ( x\u21c0 ) dx\u21c0\u22600 and \u222b\u03a9jT\u21c0 ( x\u21c0 ) dx\u21c0\u22600 in Equation 1 ) . To maintain a net traction force of zero for the whole cluster , the non-zero integrated traction force of an individual cell must be balanced by a counter force from the neighboring cell ( s ) . For a cell i in a cluster , this balancing counter force can be expressed as the negative of its integrated traction force , which we defined as its residual traction force f\u21c0resi , where f\u21c0resi=\u2212\u222b\u03a9iT\u21c0 ( x\u21c0 ) dx\u21c0 . Because the balancing counter force is transmitted by physical interactions between cells through cell\u2013cell junction ( s ) , f\u21c0resi also represents the vectorial sum of all cell\u2013cell forces exerted by cell i on its neighbors . In the case of a two-cell cluster , based on Equation 1: ( 2 ) f\u21c0i , j=f\u21c0resi=\u2212\u222b\u03a9iT\u21c0 ( x\u21c0 ) dx\u21c0=\u222b\u03a9jT\u21c0 ( x\u21c0 ) dx\u21c0 Here , f\u21c0i , j denotes the force exerted by cell i on cell j and f\u21c0i , j=\u2212f\u21c0j , i . Hence , by applying the force-balancing principle , we can derive the forces transmitted between two cells based on traction force measurements of the cells within those clusters . The force-balancing principle can be applied to all cell clusters with either a linear configuration or with a \u2018tree-like\u2019 configuration ( Figure 1 ) . In these types of cell clusters , an imaginary cut through any of the cell\u2013cell junctions , or edges in the network representation , would divide the cluster into two disconnected cell groups . Therefore , at each of the edges , the cell\u2013cell force transmitted can be obtained by summing up the traction forces over each cell group: ( 3 ) \u222b\u03a9cT\u21c0 ( x\u21c0 ) dx\u21c0=\u2211i\u2208g1\u222b\u03a9iT\u21c0 ( x\u21c0 ) dx\u21c0+\u2211j\u2208g2\u222b\u03a9jT\u21c0 ( x\u21c0 ) dx\u21c0=0 ( 4 ) f\u21c0g1 , g2=\u2212\u2211i\u2208g1\u222b\u03a9iT\u21c0 ( x\u21c0 ) dx\u21c0=\u2211j\u2208g2\u222b\u03a9jT\u21c0 ( x\u21c0 ) dx\u21c0 Here , f\u21c0g1 , g2 denotes the cell\u2013cell force that is transmitted through the interface which connects cell groups g1 and g2 . In our measurements , we calculated f\u21c0g1 , g2 by taking the mean of the two independent summations of traction forces for the two cell groups: ( 5 ) \u2329f\u21c0g1 , g2\u232a=12 ( f\u21c0g1 , g2\u2212f\u21c0g2 , g1 ) =12 ( \u2211i\u2208g1\u222b\u03a9iT\u21c0 ( x\u21c0 ) dx\u21c0\u2212\u2211j\u2208g2\u222b\u03a9jT\u21c0 ( x\u21c0 ) dx\u21c0 ) By reiterating the imaginary cut through all edges of the cell network , the force transmission at each cell\u2013cell junction of a linear or \u2018tree-like\u2019 cell cluster can be determined . While previous studies either missed this generalized method or only applied it to a linear three-cell cluster ( the simplest cell cluster with greater than two cells ) , our work has now demonstrated the applicability of this method to many complex cell clusters with three or more cells . To calculate the strain energy of cell j in the cluster , we first calculated the displacement field u\u21c0j that is associated with the traction forces T\u21c0 generated by cell j alone . This was achieved by the following integral over the footprint \u03a9j of cell j: ( 6 ) u\u21c0j ( x\u21c0 ) =\u222b\u03a9jG ( x\u21c0\u2212x\u21c0\u2032 ) \u22c5T\u21c0 ( x\u21c0\u2032 ) dx\u21c0\u2032 Here , G is the Boussinesq Green function . The strain energy Uj of cell j , which is a measure for cellular contractility ( Butler et al . , 2002 ) , is then given by: ( 7 ) Uj=12\u222b\u03a9jT\u21c0 ( x\u21c0 ) \u22c5u\u21c0j ( x\u21c0 ) dx\u21c0 Note that simply integrating over the measured displacement field u\u21c0 ( x\u21c0 ) instead of u\u21c0j ( x\u21c0 ) would yield incorrect results . This is due to the fact that elastic forces are long ranged . For a cell cluster , this means that forces from one cell will cause substrate deformations outside of its own footprint , for instance underneath the footprint of a neighboring cell . In other words , u\u21c0 ( x\u21c0 ) within \u03a9j is not generated by cell j alone but contains contributions from all cells in the cluster . The above method of calculating cell strain energy accounts for these mechanical subtleties and includes only the cell-own strains in the energy calculation . We do note that the method neglects the energy a cell might have to use to strain the substrate in the presence of other cells . The E-cadherin-GFP fluorescence intensity signal was used to segment the cluster boundary as well as the cluster internal cell\u2013cell interfaces . The cell cluster boundary was segmented automatically by first smoothing the E-cadherin-GFP fluorescence intensity image with a Gaussian filter with a standard deviation of 5 pixels . The filtered image was then thresholded according to a \u2018first minimum after first maximum algorithm\u2019: the threshold value was selected by first finding the lowest intensity maximum in the image histogram , which largely corresponds to background pixels . The first minimum in the histogram after this maximum was selected as the threshold . The largest connected component of the binary image was identified as the cell cluster . To smoothen the cluster boundary and to fill small holes , we applied a closing operation using a disk with closure radius of 3 pixels as structuring element . Larger holes in the cluster that might arise during cell divisions or when cells join the cluster were not closed and were appropriately treated as cluster external space . The obtained tight cluster mask was then dilated by 15 to 45 pixels using a disk as structuring element , yielding the dilated cluster mask . The dilation was performed to ensure that all significant traction forces are included in the cell\u2013cell force calculations . There are several reasons why significant traction forces may fall outside the segmented cluster region . First and foremost , the traction force reconstruction is limited by the spatial resolution of the bead tracking ( \u223c2 . 5\u20135 \u00b5m , dependent on the signal-to-noise ratio of the bead images and the substrate stiffness , with higher resolution for stiffer substrates ) . Second , cells at the cluster periphery often show finger-like and force-generating protrusions that are not detected by automatic cluster segmentation as they have a low E-cadherin-GFP concentration . Similarly , dividing cells exhibit retraction fibers that are barely detectable in the E-cadherin-GFP channel but seem to exert forces distant to the main cell body . The presence of these traction force vectors outside the cell footprint presents a dilemma: one would ideally want to cut off the thin-plate model at the tight cluster footprint , but then one would lose these \u2018external\u2019 forces when setting up the force balance for the cluster . We thus have taken an approach where we include these forces by extending the tight cluster mask but penalize forces with increasing distance to the detected cluster edge . Cell\u2013cell interfaces within cell clusters were drawn by hand to achieve highest reliability of the interface location . The hand drawing was guided by the E-cadherin-GFP intensity maximum along the interface curves . In regions with broader intensity curves , we additionally used the traction force maps to optimize the interface locations by avoiding traction force vectors pointing towards the interface . This criterion was deduced from the commonly accepted notion that cells do not push but only pull on the substrate . The interface drawings were also performed by three different people to avoid personal biases . The obtained cell footprints and boundaries were stored as pixelated information . The cell position was defined as the center of mass of the cell footprint . The interface length was defined as the cumulative length of line segments that connect every tenth pixel of the interface curve . If the interface curve crossed a segmentation hole in the cluster , the pixels in the holes were not counted to avoid an overestimation of the interface length . The mechanical stress distribution within a cell cluster was inferred by modeling the ventral cell cortex as a deformable thin-plate , whose internal stress field \u03c3 ( x\u21c0 ) balances the sign-inverted traction forces T\u21c0 ( x\u21c0 ) according to Landau and Lifshitz . ( 1970 ) : ( 8 ) \u2202\u03c3ik\u2202xk\u2212Ti ( x\u21c0 ) =0\u2009in\u2009\u03a9c ( 9 ) \u03c3iknk=0\u2009on\u2009\u2202\u03a9c Here , \u03a9c is the dilated cluster footprint that contains all significant traction forces and n\u21c0 denotes the outward normal to the dilated cluster boundary \u2202\u03a9c . Indices run from 1 to 2 for the x and y in-plane dimensions , and the Einstein summation convention is used . Under the assumption that the thin-plate behaves as a linear elastic and isotropic medium , the plate-internal stress field is related to the plate-internal deformation ( Landau and Lifshitz , 1970 ) by: ( 10 ) \u03c3ik=E ( x\u21c0 ) ( 1+\u03bd ) ( \u03b5ik+1 ( 1\u22122\u03bd ) \u03b5ll\u03b4ik ) , where \u03b5 ( x\u21c0 ) is the strain tensor , \u03b4ik is the Kronecker's delta symbol , and E ( x\u21c0 ) and \u03bd describe the spatially variable Young's modulus and the Poisson ratio , respectively . We set the Poisson ratio to 0 . 5 , reflecting that cell cortices are largely incompressible ( Boal , 2002 ) . The strain tensor relates to the field of displacements u\u21c0 ( x\u21c0 ) as: ( 11 ) \u03b5ik=12 ( \u2202ui\u2202xk+\u2202uk\u2202xi ) Together , Equations 8\u201311 define a boundary value problem composed of partial differential equations ( PDEs ) that determine how the inverted traction force field propagates through the thin-plate , that is , how stresses inside the thin-plate modeled cell cluster cortex must be distributed to explain the measured tractions on the substrate and , at the same time , how these stresses must deform the thin-plate . The latter relation depends on the material properties of the cell cluster cortex , which are largely unknown . However , we found that the plate-internal stress field is practically invariant to the choice of the Young's modulus , consistent with previous studies ( Tambe et al . , 2011 ) . The reason for this is primarily that the solution of Equations 8\u201311 depends on the same material model to convert traction forces into plate deformation as is used to invert plate deformation back into plate-internal stress . Therefore in a first approximation , the terms describing the material properties are canceled out by the conversion of cluster-external tractions into cluster-internal stress . To test the validity of this approach , we compared the cell\u2013cell junctional stresses derived from the PDE solution ( see below ) to the junctional forces calculated by the force-balancing principle in tree-like structures where the latter approach has a well-defined solution . Using a thin-plate model with a spatially homogeneous Young's modulus within the cluster , we obtained junctional stresses with a relative error that was comparable to the one of the force-balancing solution ( the relative errors are 14% for both methods , see Figure 2 ) . This result demonstrates that the error of both methods mainly originates from the uncertainty of the traction force measurement and that the FEM solution of the thin-plate model did not introduce additional numerical errors ( e . g . , due to numerical stress integration along discretized interfaces ) . For tree-like clusters , the two methods are thus interchangeable . This validity check on tree-like cluster , however , cannot be directly generalized to looped configurations . To this end , an alternative , yet missing , experimental method would be needed for cross-validating the thin-plate model . A more detailed cell model could yield a different stress distribution along the interfaces that may improve the correlation of cell\u2013cell stresses with E-cadherin-GFP intensity as well as the prediction of cell\u2013cell forces in looped configurations . We maintain that the material model assumptions are cell-type specific as epithelial cells , especially on softer substrates , tend to have relatively homogeneous cortical structures with few pronounced stress fibers . Moreover , the invariance of the PDE solution to the material properties may also be abolished under perturbation of certain pathways . In addition to setting Young's modulus constant within the cluster , we assumed that it decays exponentially with increasing distance d from the tight cluster mask: ( 12 ) E=E0e\u2212d\u03bb This assumption implies that pixels outside the tight cluster mask are less likely to belong to the cluster footprint as the distance increases . The length scale \u03bb was set to 10 pixels =1 . 6 \u03bcm . Given a PDE solution predicting the plate-internal stresses , cell\u2013cell junctional forces f\u21c0m , n transmitted through the interface am , n between any two cells m and n can be calculated as: ( 13 ) ( f\u21c0m , n ) i=\u2212\u222bam , n\u03c3ikdlk Here , ( f\u21c0m , n ) i denotes the ith-component of the cell\u2013cell force and dl\u21c0 defines a vector of length dl located on the cell\u2013cell interface and pointing normal to the interface toward cell n . Of note , the interface am , n can represent the entire junction between two cells or only a short stretch of it . We used the second approach to calculate the dense force exchange profiles along cell\u2013cell junctions . The boundary value problem was solved numerically using the finite element method ( FEM ) . Specifically , we implemented Equations 8\u201311 in MATLAB using the \u2018Partial Differential Equation\u2019 toolbox . The triangular mesh was generated from the dilated cluster boundary curve ( every 10th pixel was considered ) using the function initmesh with the \u2018Jiggle\u2019-option to improve the mesh quality . The mesh was then refined twice with the function refinemesh and further improved with a final application of the function jigglemesh . The resulting mesh was much denser than the traction force mesh to minimize interpolation errors . The boundary value problem was solved over the generated mesh with the assempde function . An additional component of the PDE solution implicated numerical stabilization , which is necessary because of the experimental error in determining the traction forces . The error in the traction force measurement is reflected by the inequality ( 14 ) \u222b\u03a9cT\u21c0 ( x\u21c0 ) dx\u21c0\u22600 that is , the traction forces integrated over the entire cluster are non-zero . This would imply that the cluster is subjected to an accelerating force resulting in translocation of the cluster . However , a finite solution to the boundary value problem exists only if the traction forces perfectly cancel one another over the cluster area . To correct the instability introduced by Equation 14 we added a term \u03bau\u21c0 ( x\u21c0 ) with \u03baE0=10\u22127 to the left hand side of Equation 8 . The resulting stress field remains numerically unchanged as long as the \u03ba-value is chosen small enough , such that \u03bau\u21c0 ( x\u21c0 ) is negligible compared to the other physical terms in Equation 8 . The FEM approach includes additional assumptions for calculating how mechanical stresses redistribute within a cell cluster . This was done by modeling the cell cluster as a thin , homogeneous , and elastic plate that is set under tension by the traction stress at the cell\u2013substrate interface ( Figure 3A ) . The internal cell-stress distributions were then calculated using the FEM such that the internal stresses were consistent with the measured cellular traction forces ( see \u2018Finite element method for cell\u2013cell force measurements\u2019 ) . In the final step , the calculated cluster internal stresses were integrated along each cell\u2013cell interface to obtain transmitted junctional forces . The assumptions of a thin , homogeneous , and elastic plate are well justified , as the studied MCF10A cells were relatively flat when adhered and spread on the polyacrylamide ( PAA ) gel substrates . The cells were typically only \u223c1 \u00b5m thick ( except at the nucleus ) , while the lateral dimensions were \u223c20 \u00b5m . Cells in the small clusters also did not show any significant , micron-sized structural organization of actin ( such as actin stress fibers ) along which mechanical stresses could propagate on the compliant PAA gels , supporting the homogeneous plate assumption . Furthermore , as we were only interested in the equilibrium distribution of mechanical stress in the cluster at certain time points , a purely elastic , rather than viscoelastic , description of the cells is sufficient . This model is very similar to the one used in monolayer stress microscopy . The main difference is the fact that in our approach , the cluster boundary is completely defined within the field of view . Therefore in our approach , a complete force balance equation for the cluster can be built up , which is impossible in monolayer stress microscopy . ( Note that in monolayer stress microscopy , it is unknown which stresses are transmitted at the margins of the field of view occupied with cells . ) Cells were tracked by a nearest neighbor assignment , that is , by linking cells with minimal distance between their cell centers in consecutive frames ( Burkard , 1999 ) . In case of a cell division , only the closest daughter was linked . The second daughter cell was considered as a new cell starting a new time course . Cell interfaces were tracked by minimizing the sum of three Euclidian distances , the distances between the two endpoints and their proximal correspondents , and the distance between the centers of mass . Pairs of interfaces that minimized this cost function among all possible pairings were linked . For the correlation analysis , all data were adapted to a fixed frame rate of 1/240 s . When a dataset was acquired with a higher frame rate , the time series were averaged over bins of 240 s . All time series were individually normalized to a variance of 1 before grouping several time series together . Cell\u2013cell stress values were calculated at every 10th pixel along the cell\u2013cell interfaces using the stress tensor \u03c3: ( 15 ) \u03c3INTF , i=\u03c3iknk , where \u03c3INTF , i is the ith-component of the interface stress and nk is the kth-component of the vector normal to the interface . The average distance of two neighboring cell\u2013cell stress points was 1 . 27 \u00b5m . The E-cadherin-GFP images were smoothed using a plain average filter with circular support of radius 10 pixels . For each cell\u2013cell stress value , a corresponding E-cadherin-GFP intensity value was extracted from the discretized interface curve . The correlation coefficient of E-cadherin-GFP intensity and stress magnitude were then calculated as: ( 16 ) corr ( I ( x\u21c0 ) , \u03c3INTF ( x\u21c0 ) ) =cov ( I ( x\u21c0 ) , \u03c3INTF ( x\u21c0 ) ) var ( I ) var ( \u03c3INTF ) To obtain a mean correlation coefficient , all stress and intensity pairs of all interfaces of all clusters and over all frames of an experiment were grouped together ( Figure 6B ) . The significant correlation coefficient obtained in Figure 6B suggests that FEM allows us to resolve meaningful interfacial stresses with sub-junctional resolution . To test this assertion and to determine the length scale over which force and E-cadherin recruitment are coupled , we calculated correlation coefficients for every interface in each frame individually , either with correct or randomized stress\u2013intensity pairs . For randomization , the interface was subdivided into sub-junctional segments of length \u0394l . If a cell\u2013cell junction was shorter than \u0394l , it was not considered in the analysis . If the interface was longer but not in multiples of \u0394l , the remaining fragment was complemented with neighboring data points to precisely match \u0394l . Randomization was then performed within each segment and one \u2018randomized\u2019 correlation coefficient was calculated for the entire interface . The correlation coefficients obtained from individual interfaces were then grouped together in a histogram ( see Figure 6F ) . For uncorrelated data , one expects a median correlation of 0 . Furthermore , the longer the segment length the more will the coefficient distribution tighten up with a peak at zero correlation . The length scale of cadherin-stress coupling was defined as the value of \u0394l for which the median correlation coefficient of the randomized pairs falls below 50% of the correct pairing ( Figure 6C ) ; this is to say that for shorter segment lengths , the randomized and correct pairings exhibit similar correlations . We cannot identify whether the abrogation of distinct correlation coefficients is related to the absence of finer force and cadherin co-variations or because FEM cannot resolve finer stress variations . Thus , this limit also may define an upper bound for the resolution of sub-junctional forces . To precisely quantify long-range force transmission in cell clusters , we performed a cross-correlation analysis of force pairs from two interfaces of a cell . Consider a cell that is surrounded by at least two neighboring cells , denoted as \u2018m\u2019 for the \u2018middle\u2019 cell ( Figure 9A ) . At any time point , the vectorial sum over all cell\u2013cell and cell\u2013matrix forces has to be balanced . A fluctuation in direction or magnitude of one cell\u2013cell force vector exerted on cell m , say f\u21c0i , m , thus has to be counterbalanced by an opposite fluctuation of either the traction forces of cell m , f\u21c0resm=\u2212\u222b\u03a9mT\u21c0 ( x\u21c0 ) dx\u21c0 , or by the cell\u2013cell forces at the remaining interfaces of cell m , \u2211j\u2260if\u21c0j , m . If the cell\u2013cell forces are completely transmitted across cell m , then the cross-correlation between the cell\u2013cell forces should be perfectly anti-correlated , that is , corr ( f\u21c0i . m , \u2211j\u2260if\u21c0j , m ) =\u22121 . At the same time , no correlation between cell\u2013cell force and traction forces should be found: corr ( f\u21c0i , m , f\u21c0resm ) =0 . In the case where cell\u2013cell forces are not transmitted across cell m , the forces should be decoupled , and their correlation should vanish corr ( f\u21c0i , m , \u2211j\u2260if\u21c0j , m ) =0 , while the cell\u2013cell and cell traction forces should be anti-correlated: corr ( f\u21c0i , m , f\u21c0resm ) =\u22121 . This anti-correlation means that the cell\u2013cell force is locally counter-balanced by the cell's traction forces . Implementation of this cross-correlation analysis is described in detail in the below section ( \u2018Cross-correlation of cellular force vectors\u2019 ) . All possible component-wise cross-correlations of two vectors in two dimensions can be expressed in matrix form as: ( 17 ) corr ( f\u21c01 , f\u21c02 ) =[corr ( f1 , x , f2 , x ) corr ( f1 , x , f2 , y ) corr ( f1 , y , f2 , x ) corr ( f1 , y , f2 , y ) ] . We note that the matrix is symmetric . In our specific case , the vectors are two cellular forces f\u21c01 and f\u21c02 that are balanced by a third cellular force , f\u21c03 . For example , when considering the correlation of the cell\u2013cell forces , corr ( f\u21c0i , m , \u2211j\u2260if\u21c0j , m ) , exerted on cell m , the f\u21c01 corresponds to f\u21c0i , m , f\u21c02 corresponds to \u2211j\u2260if\u21c0j , m , and f\u21c03 corresponds to f\u21c0resm , subject to the force balance f\u21c0i , m+\u2211j\u2260if\u21c0j , m+f\u21c0resm=0 . Thus , it is expected that the off-diagonal components of the matrix in Equation 17 equal zero on average , and that only the diagonal components yield a significant correlation . Furthermore , as the choice of the coordinate system is arbitrary , the correlation of the two diagonal components should yield , on average , identical values and thus: ( 18 ) corr ( f\u21c01 , f\u21c02 ) =cf1 , f2[1001] , where cf1 , f2 is the average correlation of the x or y components , respectively . Numerically we calculated cf1 , f2 as the mean of the two diagonal components: ( 19 ) cf1 , f2=12 ( corr ( f1 , x , f2 , x ) +corr ( f1 , y , f2 , y ) ) . We note that \u22121\u2264cf1 , f2\u22641 . Accordingly , temporal cross-correlations of forces are calculated as: ( 20 ) corr ( f1 ( t+dt ) , f2 ( t ) ) =12 ( \u2211k=x , ycorr ( f1 , k ( t+dt ) , f2 , k ( t ) ) ) . Standard box plots were created using MATLAB with the horizontal line within each box indicating the sample median , the bottom and top of the box representing the first and third quartile , respectively , and the whiskers extending to the most extreme data points that fall within 1 . 5 times the difference between the first and third quartile . Points outside the whiskers represent outliers . Non-overlapping notches between samples indicate that the sample medians differ with statistical significance at the 5% level . As indicated , additional statistical tests were conducted to calculate the level of statistical significance . The Wilcoxon rank sum test , also known as the Mann\u2013Whitney U test , was used . All computational parts of this project were performed in MATLAB . The solution of the thin-plate model required functions of the \u2018Partial Differential Equations\u2019 toolbox of MATLAB , which are listed above ( see \u2018Finite element method for cell\u2013cell force measurements\u2019 ) . Each calculation step is not particularly demanding with respect to computational hardware . For instance , no large memory is required and the entire analysis can thus be performed on normal computers . With respect to computation time , the most demanding step by far is the detection of bead displacements that are the input for the traction force calculations . It is an established method based on correlative template matching and takes on the order of several hours per video . In contrast , solving the thin-plate model is much faster and takes only several minutes . We note however that the actual computation time will be highly dependent on the individual hardware specifications and software implementation .

{"lay_summary": "Huntington\u2019s disease is an inherited disorder that occurs in adulthood and sometimes in children . It causes progressive damage to the brain and people with the condition develop memory loss , movement difficulties , confusion , and other symptoms of mental decline . Eventually , the disease leads to death . Mutations in the gene that encodes a protein called huntingtin cause Huntington\u2019s disease . Individuals who inherit just one copy of the mutated gene develop the condition . No treatments currently exist that can slow or stop disease progression . Genetic and molecular studies are beginning to shed light on how mutations in the gene encoding huntingtin cause the disease . Normally , the protein has a section near its tail end made up of the amino acid glutamine repeated around 23 times . Mutations that increase the number of glutamines to more than 38 cause Huntington\u2019s disease . The more extra glutamines there are in this region of the protein , the earlier in life the disease symptoms begin . But it was not clear how these extra glutamines near the tail of huntingtin affect the structure and behavior of a protein that is more than 3 , 000 amino acids long . Now , Vijayvargia et al . have revealed why the tail end of huntingtin is so important . Several biophysical methods were used to determine the three-dimensional structure of the huntingtin protein . These methods revealed that the protein folds up into a hollow sphere and that its tail end is able to interact with the entire length of the protein and physically touches its opposite end . To see this in more detail , Vijayvargia et al . used another experimental technique called crosslinking mass spectrometry to confirm which parts of the huntingtin protein are in close contact with each other . Together with the structural data , these experiments suggest that the stretch of glutamines is in the position to bring about subtle , but widespread , changes throughout the huntingtin protein . That is to say , that having more glutamines slightly changes the curve of the sphere and alters the way different parts of the protein interact . Together the new findings explain why mutations that alter the tail of huntingtin affect the rest of the protein . Further work will now aim to provide a more-detailed structure of the huntingtin protein and to investigate what other roles of huntingtin are affected by the increased number of glutamines in the protein\u2019s tail . These insights may help scientists understand how the mutated protein causes brain decline .", "article": "The polyglutamine expansion in huntingtin protein causes Huntington\u2019s disease . Here , we investigated structural and biochemical properties of huntingtin and the effect of the polyglutamine expansion using various biophysical experiments including circular dichroism , single-particle electron microscopy and cross-linking mass spectrometry . Huntingtin is likely composed of five distinct domains and adopts a spherical \u03b1-helical solenoid where the amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal regions fold to contain a circumscribed central cavity . Interestingly , we showed that the polyglutamine expansion increases \u03b1-helical properties of huntingtin and affects the intramolecular interactions among the domains . Our work delineates the structural characteristics of full-length huntingtin , which are affected by the polyglutamine expansion , and provides an elegant solution to the apparent conundrum of how the extreme amino-terminal polyglutamine tract confers a novel property on huntingtin , causing the disease . \n Huntingtin is the entire large protein product ( >350\u2009kDa MW ) of the Huntingtin gene ( HTT previously HD ) . Huntingtin has a segment of polyglutamine near its amino terminus ( Amino-terminal ) that is encoded by a polymorphic CAG trinucleotide repeat . If expanded above 38-residues , this mutation causes Huntington\u2019s disease ( HD ) , a dominant neurodegenerative disorder ( Huntington's Disease Collaborative Research Group , 1993 ) . The strong correlation between the size of the expanded repeat and the age at diagnosis of HD motor , cognitive and psychiatric symptoms shows that CAG repeat-size is the primary determinant of the rate of the disease progression ( Brinkman et al . , 1997; Snell et al . , 1993 ) . This biological relationship also provides a human patient-based rationale for delineating the HD disease-trigger in studies with an allelic series designed to determine the effects of progressively increasing the size of the mutation . Consistent with genetic studies in distinct CAG-expansion neurodegenerative disorders and CAG knock-in mice that replicate the HD mutation , the mechanism that triggers the disease process that leads to the characteristic vulnerability of striatal neurons in HD is thought to involve a novel gain of function that is conferred on mutant huntingtin by the expanded polyglutamine segment ( Gusella and MacDonald , 2000; Nucifora et al . , 2001; Trettel et al . , 2000 ) . By analogy with other members of the HEAT/HEAT-like ( Huntingtin , Elongation factor 3 , protein phosphatase 2A , Target of rapamycin 1 ) repeat family ( Andrade and Bork , 1995; Perry and Kleckner , 2003 ) , huntingtin is likely a HEAT domain solenoid that functions as a mechanical scaffold for multi-member complexes ( Grinthal et al . , 2010; Takano and Gusella , 2002 ) . Huntingtin\u2019s large size and predicted predominant HEAT/HEAT-like repeat domain structure is well conserved through 500 million years of evolution ( Seong et al . , 2010 ) . The polyglutamine region is not conserved in some huntingtin orthologues ( Seong et al . , 2010 ) , implying a role as an extra feature that fine-tunes huntingtin structure and function . Indeed , testing this idea , we have previously demonstrated , with purified recombinant human huntingtins in a cell-free assay , that lengthening the polyglutamine tract quantitatively enhances the basal function of huntingtin in stimulating Polycomb repressive complex 2 ( PRC2 ) histone methyltransferase ( Seong et al . , 2010 ) . The structures of smaller HEAT/HEAT-like repeat solenoid scaffold proteins , such as PR65/A and Importin \u03b2 , have been solved to high-resolution , and each has been shown to assume a distinctive extended curvilinear shape determined by the specific stacking characteristics of its HEAT/HEAT-like repeats ( Cingolani et al . , 1999; Groves et al . , 1999 ) . The topology of the huntingtin solenoid is expected to reflect the specific stacking characteristics of \u03b1-helical HEAT/HEAT-like repeats that span the molecule . The shape imparted by intramolecular\u00a0stacking cannot be predicted because of the idiosyncratic nature of HEAT/HEAT-like repeats , which are loosely conserved ~34 amino acid bipartite \u03b1-helical units ( Takano and Gusella , 2002 ) . Nevertheless this shape must enable modulation by the amino-terminal polyglutamine segment . It seems reasonable that this may involve some structural feature that is critical to huntingtin function . One possibility is structure-dependent post-translational modification . Human huntingtin is phosphorylated , at more than seventy modified serine , threonine and tyrosine residues ( Hornbeck et al . , 2012 ) . Indeed , a comparison of lines of transgenic modified HTT BAC mice has implicated unique amino-terminal serine phosphorylation in protection against deleterious effects of mutant huntingtin ( Gu et al . , 2009 ) and the polyglutamine expansion at the amino-terminal causes a trend of hypo-phosphorylation in all sites , including sites near the carboxyl-terminus ( Anne et al . , 2007; Schilling et al . , 2006; Warby et al . , 2005 ) , indirectly implying a long-range impact of the amino-terminal region on huntingtin structure and function . In order to solve the apparent puzzle of how huntingtin\u2019s solenoid structure may enable quantitative or qualitative ( or both ) modulation of huntingtin function , according to the size of the amino-terminal polyglutamine tract , we have extended initial observations showing a likely flexible \u03b1-helical structure by conducting systematic biophysical and biochemical analyses of members of a panel of highly purified human recombinant huntingtins , with varied lengths of polyglutamine tracts ( Fodale et al . , 2014; Huang et al . , 2015; Li et al . , 2006 ) . \n It has been reported previously that purified huntingtin exhibits a predominantly \u03b1-helical secondary structure but among studies the impact of polyglutamine size has been inconsistent ( Fodale et al . , 2014; Huang et al . , 2015; Li et al . , 2006 ) . To carry out a standardized evaluation , we performed circular dichroism ( CD ) analysis of a series of recombinant human huntingtins with different polyglutamine tract lengths ( Q2- , Q23- , Q46- , Q67- , Q78-huntingtin , respectively ) purified to homogeneity ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . The CD spectra ( Figure 1B ) of all of the huntingtins are consistent with a predominant \u03b1-helical secondary structure ( Liu and Rost , 2003; Rost et al . , 1994 ) ( Figure 1A ) , with typical minima at 222 and 208 nm and a positive peak at 195 nm , and all exhibited the same irreversible thermal denaturation pattern , with secondary structure stable up to ~38\u201340\u00b0C , a gradual slow denaturation as the temperature is increased to 65\u201370\u00b0C , followed by aggregation and some precipitation ( Figure 1C ) . These results imply the same basic core structure and stability regardless of the size of the expanded polyglutamine segment . Plotting an average of the Mean Residue Ellipticity ( MRE ) at 222 nm ( characteristic of an \u03b1-helix ) reveals an incremental quantitative effect of lengthening the polyglutamine tract at the amino terminus on the \u03b1-helicity of the entire molecule ( Figure 1D ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 11184 . 003Figure 1 . Huntingtin secondary structure is modulated by the length of polyglutamine tract . ( A ) Human huntingtin amino acid sequence ( Homo sapiens; NP_002102 ) was analyzed for predicted secondary structure using: NORSp ( Liu and Rost , 2003 ) and PROF ( Profile network prediction Heidelberg ) ( Rost et al . , 1994 ) . Stick model of human huntingtin protein ( 3144 amino acids ) was generated depicting the predicted alpha helical ( red ) , random coil ( yellow ) and beta sheet ( grey ) regions . The polyglutamine tract in the amino-terminus is indicated in purple . ( B ) The far UV-wavelength scan at 25\u00b0C of these purified huntingtin proteins generates a curve typical of \u03b1-helical proteins . ( C ) Thermal behavior of Q23- , Q46- and Q78-huntingtin . The heat denaturation curves , from 25 to 95\u00b0C , of all proteins showed the similar pattern of irreversible thermal denaturation starting their denaturation above 40\u00b0C by MRE values at 222 nm . Due to inherent variation caused by inefficient mixing in the cuvette with taking readings every five degrees of heating , their heat denaturation curves were acquired in duplicates . Solid line represents heating to 95\u00b0C; dotted line represents cooling from 95\u00b0C . ( D ) An average ( MRE ) in units of deg . cm2/dmol , at 222 nm wavelength characteristic of an \u03b1-helix ) , from two independent experiments , was plotted against the length of the polyglutamine tract of huntingtin proteins ( bars represent mean \u00b1 SEM ) . Temperature was 25\u00b0C . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 11184 . 00310 . 7554/eLife . 11184 . 004Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1 . Normalization of purified huntingtin proteins with varied polyglutamine tract length . ( A ) Recombinant human huntingtin proteins with indicated polyglutamine tract length were purified as described in the methods . Purity was judged by Coomassie Blue stain after SDS PAGE analysis . Equal amounts ( 2 \u03bcg ) of the proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE followed by coomassie staining to indicate purity of the preparations . These proteins were used throughout the study . ( B ) Equal amount ( 50 ng ) of indicated purified huntingtin proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane and probed with anti-Htt antibodies with amino-terminal ( mAb2166 ) or carboxyl-terminal ( HF-1 ) epitope to show equal loading . To demonstrate huntingtin polyglutamine repeat length , the blot was also probed with polyglutamine length-specific antibody ( mAb1F8 ) . Moreover , as expected , as the polyglutamine tract size was increased , the highly purified huntingtins exhibited decreasing mobility ( A ) and increasing detectability with polyglutamine-directed antibody mAb1F8 ( B ) . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 11184 . 004 We then investigated the proposal that huntingtin\u2019s shape may enable a structural impact of the amino-terminal polyglutamine tract , by performing single-particle electron microscopy ( EM ) of recombinant human huntingtins with polyglutamine tract lengths of 23- and 78-residues . These were purified to high homogeneity using a gradient purification method with mild crosslinking ( GraFix ) ( Kastner et al . , 2008 ) , collecting only the monomer fraction for analysis to eliminate potential contributions from oligomeric structures that would confound interpretation of the results ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . Negative-stained micrographs of these proteins confirmed that the samples were highly homogeneous ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . A total of 10 , 169 particles were chosen for generating 2D class averages and 30 class averages were used for reconstructing a 3D EM map of Q23-huntingtin ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3A ) . The EM map of Q23-huntingtin at about 30\u2009\u00c5 resolution , estimated from Fourier shell correlation analysis , shows that the molecule adopts an overall spherical shape with 130\u2009\u00c5 height and 100\u2009\u00c5 width ( Figure 2A and Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4 ) . The overall shape of huntingtin was not apparently affected either through crosslinking or by the tag as 2D class averages of huntingtin with no cross linker or without tag also showed a similar spherical shape ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3 ) . The outer volume of the structure can be roughly estimated as 861 , 829 \u00c53 and a Mathew\u2019s coefficient ( VM ) of 2 . 48 , assuming that Q23-huntingtin is a sphere with 115\u2009\u00c5 diameter with 348\u2009kDa molecular weight . Considering the VM=1 . 23 for the protein itself , Q23-huntingtin appears to contain a large solvent cavity ( up to 50% by volume ) . Consistent with this estimation , the 3D EM reconstruction of Q23-huntingtin shows a large cavity in the core ( Figure 2B ) . The analysis of negatively-stained Q78-huntingtin ( Figure 2C and Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3B ) disclosed a 3D map showing a similar overall spherical shape , with a large cavity in the core ( Figure 2D ) . Although 3D maps were reconstructed de novo without other experimental methods such as random conical tilt , the high similarity of the shapes between Q23- and Q78-huntingtin 3D maps attests that huntingtin has the spherical structure with a cavity ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 5 ) . Notably , manual superimposition of the 3D maps of Q23-huntingtin and Q78-huntingtin reveals potential differences in the two structures ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 5 ) , which may reflect technical variation ( image processing , stain distribution , sample heterogeneity ) , in addition to the structural effects of the lengthened polyglutamine segment that were foreshadowed by the altered CD spectra ( Figure 1D ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 11184 . 005Figure 2 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 11184 . 010 We then attempted to locate the amino-terminus ( 17 residues adjacent to the polyglutamine tract ) of huntingtin in the EM maps , by collecting images of negatively-stained purified complexes of antibody-bound amino-terminal FLAG-tags of the Q23- and Q78-huntingtin ( Figure 3 and Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1 and 2 ) . We also proceeded to reconstitute 3D structure of Q23- and Q78-huntingtin-antibody complexes . Comparisons of the 2D class averages and 3D reconstituted structures between huntingtin alone and the huntingtin-FLAG-antibody complex pairs clearly reveals an extra density at the top of the structure ( in the view shown ) for both Q23- and Q78-huntingtin ( Figure 3 ) . These observations strongly imply that the extreme N-terminus , and by inference the adjacent polyglutamine tract , is folded back , forming a spherically shaped solenoid with an internal cavity , but is accessible at the outside surface , regardless of its length . 10 . 7554/eLife . 11184 . 011Figure 3 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 11184 . 013 To further examine structural characteristics such as folding , we then assessed intramolecular interactions within huntingtin as estimated from the spatial proximity of lysine residues in sucrose-gradient-selected monomeric Q23- and Q78-huntingtin , determined by disuccinimidyl suberate ( DSS ) cross-linking mass spectrometry ( DSS XL-MS ) analysis ( Leitner et al . , 2014 ) ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1 , Supplementary file 1 ) . Based upon the spacing between the DSS-cross-linked lysine residues in the primary sequence , the interactions that were detected for either huntingtin can be grouped into three categories , depicted in Figure 4A . These comprise: #1 ) short-range interactions ( within a 200 amino acid interval ) , which seem likely to occur within the same secondary structure element , including the contacts between pairs of adjacent lysines ( e . g . K174-K178 and K664-K669 ) , and the interactions between K220 , K255 and K262; #2 ) mid-range interactions ( 201 to 1000 amino acid interval ) , such as K826-K1559 , K943-K1559 and K2548-K2934; and #3 ) long-range contacts ( interval of >1000 amino acids ) , including between the carboxyl-terminal K2969 and amino-terminal K943 residue . Inspection of the depiction of the short-range cross-link contact sites relative to the location of the protease-sensitive sites ( Seong et al . , 2010 ) indicates that huntingtin is likely to be composed of five distinct domains ( Figure 4A upper panel ) . The location of the protease-sensitive major hinge region located at residues 1184\u20131254 defines the 150\u2009kDa amino-terminal domain ( NTD ) and the 200\u2009kDa carboxyl-terminal domain ( CTD ) . A minor-protease sensitive site located at ~ residue 500 demarcates the NTD into NTD-1 and NTD-II . Interestingly , a region centrally located within the CTD showed strikingly few crosslinks , despite the presence of several lysine residues , strongly implying a distinct sub-domain that we call \u2018uncrosslinked\u2019 sub-domain ( UCD ) , which , given the paucity of short range intramolecular contacts , may adopt a largely unfolded structure . The UCD is flanked by regions with numerous intramolecular contacts; the CTD-I in proximity to the major proteolysis site and the carboxyl-terminal CTD-II ( Figure 4A ) . Consistent with the hypothesis of five discernable huntingtin sub-domains , the results of hydrophobicity analysis show a transition in hydrophobicity prediction at the edge of each sub-domain ( data not shown ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 11184 . 014Figure 4 . Cross-linking mass spectrometry analysis shows the intra-molecular interactions of Q23- , Q78- and Q46-huntingtin . The 3 , 144 amino acid primary huntingtin sequence ( by convention Q23-huntingtin ) is depicted as a yellow bar with the location of the polyglutamine tract indicated by the green arrowhead ( A ) . The short- , mid- and long-range Lys-Lys cross-links by DSS identified in Q23-huntingtin ( above the bar , Q23 ) and Q78-huntingtin ( below the bar , Q78 ) by XL-MS are depicted by the green , blue and red-colored lines , respectively . Below that is a schematic view of huntingtin with five sub-domains delineated by the shared patterns of intra-molecular interactions; two amino-terminal ( NTD-I , NTD-II ) and three carboxyl-terminal ( CTD-I , UCD and CTD-II ) , as defined relative to the landmark major protease-sensitive site at ~ residue 1200 identified previously ( Seong et al . , 2010 ) , which is denoted by the large red arrowhead , while the secondary minor cleavage site is denoted by the small red arrowhead . The cross-links of Q46 huntingtin ( Q46 ) identified in XL-MS analysis are also shown under the five sub-domains schematic . Lys-Lys cross-links by DSS unique to Q23-huntingtin , Q78-huntingtin and Q46-huntingtin are shown in cyan , pink , and orange , respectively in each pair-wise comparison of Q23 vs Q78 ( B ) , Q23 vs Q46 ( C ) or Q46 vs Q78 ( D ) . The amino-terminal ( yellow ) and carboxyl-terminal ( blue ) sub-domains are depicted in cartoons ( E ) to show more substantial interactions ( red thicker dashed arrows ) between NTD-I and CTD-I in Q23-huntingtin ( left ) and between CTD-II and NTD-II or CTD-I in Q78-huntingtin ( right ) and throughout both amino- and carboxyl-terminal sub-domains in Q46-huntingtin ( middle ) . In all three huntingtins ( all red dashed arrows ) , NTD-I folds to contact CTD-I and CTD-II also contacts CTD-I as well as NTD-II , implying that the physical impact of the polyglutamine tract at the very amino-terminal end has the opportunity to subtly but globally alter the entire huntingtin structure and function in a polyglutamine length-dependent manner .

( A ) Q23-huntingtin was separated by 10\u201330% sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation after DSS crosslinking . Fractions 5\u201312 were analyzed on a Tris-Acetate gel ( 3\u20138% ) with Tris-Glycine native running buffer ( M: marker , input: Q23-huntingtin before ultracentrifugation . Q78-huntingtin ( B ) or Q46-huntingtin ( C ) was separated and prepared in the same way as Q23-huntingtin . Notably , we found that the glutaraldehyde crosslinked huntingtin and DSS crosslinked huntingtin behave differently . We achieved a better separation with a 10\u201330% sucrose gradient for the DSS crosslinked huntingtin , but with a 5\u201320% sucrose gradient for the glutaraldehyde crosslinked huntingtin in Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1 . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 11184 . 015 The mid- and long-range interactions occur between these sub-domains in a pattern that indicates close-proximity of the extreme amino- and carboxyl-terminal sub-domains . Specifically , NTD-I mainly interacts with CTD-I , while CTD-II interacts with NTD-II and notably with CTD-1 . Thus , the pattern of mid- and long-range contacts supports a view of huntingtin folding such that the extreme amino-terminal subdomain ( NTD-I ) , with its polyglutamine tract , and the extreme carboxyl-terminal subdomain ( CTD-II ) are close to each other by virtue of contacts that each makes with the NTD-II and CTD-I sub-domains that flank the major cleavage site . Notably , the overall contact-patterns for the Q23- and Q78-huntingtin were similar , supporting observations of a generally similar core-stability ( Figure 1 ) and shape ( Figures 2 and 3 ) . However , subtraction of the 38 crosslinks common to both proteins highlight networks of contacts that are relatively specific for either Q23-huntingtin ( 13 crosslinks ) or Q78-huntingtin ( 8 crosslinks ) , as depicted in Figure 4B . To further examine the patterns of the internal interaction depending on its polyglutamine length , we also performed XL-MS analysis of Q46-huntingtin . First , the overall contact-patterns of Q46-huntingtin were similar and consistent with the five distinct domains ( Figure 4A lower panel ) . Compared with those of Q23- and Q78-huntingtin , the unique contacts of Q46 reveal widespread interactions across the entire region of the protein ( Figure 4C and D ) . These unique , largely mid- and long-range contacts disclose that Q23-huntingtin exhibits more unique interactions of the NTD-I with the CTD-I , and Q78-huntingtin displays more unique contacts between the CTD-II and the CTD-I and on occasion with NTD-II . On the other hand , the unique crosslinks of Q46-huntingtin reveal that CTD-I seems to interact with both NTD-I and CTD-II as if Q46-huntingtin posits an intermediate conformation between Q23- and Q78-huntingtin . ( Figure 4E ) . These observations imply a subtle but detectable 3-dimensional structural impact of polyglutamine tract length as it increases . \n We applied a systematic structure-function approach to delineate the features of huntingtin that conspire with its polyglutamine tract to comprise , in conjunction with some as yet unknown target , the dominant gain of function mechanism that triggers the pathogenic process in patients\u00a0with\u00a0HD . Our biophysical analyses of an allelic series of native recombinant human huntingtins now provide a satisfying solution to the mystery of how the amino-terminal polyglutamine tract may be in a position to modulate huntingtin structure and function . The results of EM and XL-MS analyses provide coherent support for a HEAT/HEAT-like repeat solenoid comprising a major hinge that delimits two large nearly equal-sized domains that fold such that the ends of each arm are in close proximity and the whole circumscribes an extensive internal cavity . Other HEAT repeat proteins such as nuclear importin and exportins have functional protein-protein binding interfaces located at the inner side of the solenoid structure ( Chook and Blobel , 2001; Cingolani et al . , 1999 ) . Considering that the size of huntingtin is much bigger than other HEAT repeat proteins , we can imagine that the HEAT repeat domains can be folded back to form a closed structure that we have observed in huntingtin , having functional sites located in the internal cavity . This shape classifies huntingtin as a closed helical solenoid , contrasting with the shorter open curvilinear HEAT/HEAT-like repeat solenoids whose native structures have been solved at high resolution ( Cingolani et al . , 1999; Groves et al . , 1999 ) . Huntingtin\u2019s distinctive shape is predicted to provide both internal and external surface topologies that may mediate the binding of proteins or nucleic acids , as befitting a mechanical HEAT/HEAT-like repeat interaction-scaffold ( Takano and Gusella , 2002 ) . Our biophysical analyses also provide basic insights for future higher-resolution studies that will be needed to more precisely delineate huntingtin structure and its modulation by the polyglutamine tract . The DSS-XL-MS intramolecular cross-linking data , together with our previously reported limited proteolysis analysis ( Seong et al . , 2010 ) provide a general sense of how rod-like \u03b1-helical HEAT/HEAT-like repeat domains , may fold to delimit the closed shape that we observe . The pattern of proteolysis , regardless of polyglutamine tract length , revealed a single major cleavage-sensitive site at ~ residue 1200 , strongly predicting a major hinge or pivot that roughly parses the protein into two nearly equal \u2018arms\u2019 , a 150\u2009kDa NTD and a 200\u2009kDa CTD . This is supported by the patterns of short- and mid-range intramolecular DSS-XL-MS delineated intramolecular contacts that are shared by the Q23- , Q46- and Q78-huntingtin , which are mainly located within and between each of the regions that immediately flank this location , implying extensive local internal folding and close proximity of the \u2018arms\u2019 around the pivot-point . Multiple short- and mid-range interactions are also detected at the ends of the NTD-I and CTD-II . These contacts imply internal folding near the ends of each arm . Limited proteolysis of the amino-terminal domain did reveal an internal cleavage site , located at ~ residue 500 , which is consistent with internal pivot points , along with other internal folding , that may explain the short- and mid-range contacts detected by XL-MS near the terminus . However , the carboxyl-terminal domain lacked internal cleavage-accessible sites ( Seong et al . , 2010 ) , implying a paucity of accessible hinge-points . Consistent with this , XL-MS fails to detect short- or mid-range cross-linked lysine residues in the sub-region spanning amino acids ~1800 to ~2300 , except one long distance contact and one short distance contact only in Q46-huntingtin . This sub-region contains 13 lysine residues . It is possible that these residues are not DSS-accessible although we did observe DSS modified , but not cross-linked peptides in this region ( data not shown ) , implying instead a more extended 3D structure that maximizes the surface area available for interaction with binding-partners , as in other HEAT repeat solenoid proteins ( Cingolani et al . , 1999; Grinthal et al . , 2010; Groves et al . , 1999 ) . By contrast , the adjacent extreme C-terminus does display some internal short- and mid-range cross-linking interactions that suggest internal folding , though apparently without a well-defined proteolysis-accessible hinge-point . However , perhaps the most striking finding is the multiple long-range interaction cross-links between the CTD-II and CTD-I or NTD-II , as well as the long-range contacts of the NTD-I with the CTD-I close to the major hinge-pivot , which places the ends of each arm in close proximity to each other on the carboxyl-terminal domain arm , above the major hinge . Of note , EM analysis of the\u00a0amino-terminal FLAG-antibody-huntingtin complex strongly suggests accessibility of the extreme N-terminus , and likely the adjacent polyglutamine tract , at the external surface . Thus , folding of the two main HEAT/HEAT-like domains forms an extensive internal cavity consistent with the shape that we observe in EM analysis , while providing an elegant explanation for the conundrum of how the polyglutamine tract located at the end of the amino-terminal arm may affect change throughout the entire protein . All of the huntingtins , regardless of polyglutamine tract length , appear to have the same basic core structure . Our CD data demonstrates that they are all \u03b1-helical and have the same pattern of thermal stability , denaturing over the same temperature range . They have similar shapes in EM analysis and display mostly shared DSS-XL-MS intramolecular interactions , as discussed above . Nevertheless the differences among huntingtins with different polyglutamine lengths ( Q23 , Q46 and Q78 ) are telling . Each displays a unique intramolecular interaction pattern that is most evident in the long-range contacts detected by DSS-XL-MS analysis . Q23-huntingtin features unique additional contacts between the end of the amino-terminal domain arm with the carboxyl-terminal arm , near the hinge region , whereas Q78-huntingtin is characterized by additional interactions of the end region of the carboxyl-terminal arm with itself near the hinge region , in proximity to the location of the contacts made by the end region of the amino-terminal arm , or with the amino-terminal arm near the hinge . It is intriguing that most of these unique normal and mutant huntingtin folding characteristics involve contacts at the locations on the CTD-I near the major hinge where many other contacts that are common to both proteins converge . While Q23- and Q78-huntingtin show unique crosslinks skewed toward either amino-terminal or carboxyl-terminal region respectively , the wide-spread intramolecular interactions of Q46-huntingtin prompt us to hypothesize that the polyglutamine tract expansion induces subtle but progressive structural changes in huntingtin . This implies that polyglutamine tract length may subtly alter the basic structure by influencing the degree to which the end of the carboxyl-terminal arm is folded back upon itself onto the region around the major hinge: the longer the polyglutamine tract , the more are the contacts . This suggests a location of torsion or tension on the major hinge region that may be exerted by a balance between the positions of the amino-terminal end region contacts and carboxyl-terminal end region contacts . Consistent with our data , particularly including long-range interaction affected by the polyglutamine expansion , a few studies previously implied and reported the global structural and functional influence by the polyglutamine tract size: the interaction with HAP40 at the extreme carboxyl-terminus of huntingtin was influenced by the polyglutamine expansion ( Pal et al . , 2006 ) ; the proteolytically cleaved amino-terminal fragment interacted with the carboxyl-terminal fragment of huntingtin ( El-Daher et al . , 2015 ) ; the proximity between the first 17 residues and the polyproline region has been shown to change by the polyglutamine tract size both in exon 1 fragment and endogenous full-length huntingtin ( Caron et al . , 2013 ) . Perhaps huntingtin binding involves internal surface features that are accessed by a spring-loaded action of the major hinge-region that entails the end-region contacts of each arm . Importin HEAT/HEAT-like solenoid proteins undergo substantial conformational change around a hinge-pivot region upon cargo binding ( Cingolani et al . , 1999 ) . The impact of the polyglutamine tract on huntingtin basic structural features strongly suggests that it is possible that huntingtin may also undergo dramatic conformational change upon interaction with its binding partners . The success of our structural analysis using an allelic series of huntingtins with different polyglutamine tract lengths suggests that this approach applied to high-resolution analyses will continue to yield insights into the huntingtin disease trigger-mechanism . \n All recombinant human FLAG-huntingtin cDNA used in this study were cloned in insect expression vector systems that were modified as previously described ( Seong et al . , 2010 ) . Essentially , the original polylinker region of pFASTBAC1 vector ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) was swapped with the modified polylinker containing 1X FLAG , 6X histidine tag , TEV protease recognition site , and several restriction enzyme sites , including NcoI , XhoI and SacII , using BamHI-KpnI sites . Full-length HTT cDNA was cloned in two steps . First , the NcoI-XhoI HTT cDNA fragment ( Faber et al . , 1998; Seong et al . , 2010 ) , encoding huntingtin amino acids 1\u2013171 with varying polyglutamine tracts ( Q2 , 23 , 46 , 67 , 78 ) , was inserted between the unique NcoI and XhoI restriction sites in the modified linker . Second , the 9 , 046 bp XhoI-SacII HTT cDNA fragment from a full huntingtin cDNA clone , pBS-HD1-3144Q23 ( Faber et al . , 1998; Seong et al . , 2010 ) , encoding huntingtin amino acids 172\u20133 , 144 was inserted in frame using XhoI-SacII into the linker region . We confirmed by sequencing that this XhoI-SacII cDNA differs from the reference cDNA ( Genbank accession number L12392 ) in two locations , reflecting polymorphisms: Lys1240Arg and the Delta2642 polymorphism ( Ambrose et al . , 1994 ) encoding Glu amino acids 2640\u20132645 in a run of five rather than six residues . The SacII site in the linker was unique because the original SacII site in pFASTBac1 vector had been removed before adding the linker . All final clones , namely pALHDQ2 , pALHDQ23 , pALHDQ46 , pALHDQ67 and pALHDQ78 encoding full-length human FLAG-Q2- , 23- , 46- , 67- and Q78- huntingtin , respectively , were verified using full DNA sequence analysis . By convention , the amino acid numbering throughout the text follows the numbering of L12392 ( Q23 ) regardless of the length of the polyglutamine tract . Purification of FLAG-tag huntingtin was carried out as previously described ( Seong et al . , 2010 ) . Briefly , FLAG-tag huntingtin was expressed from pALHD ( Q2 , 23 , 46 , 67 , 78 ) in the Baculovirus Expression system ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) . The Sf9 cell lysate , obtained by freezing/thawing in buffer A ( 50\u2009mM Tris-HCl pH 8 . 0 , 500\u2009mM NaCl , and 5% glycerol ) containing complete protease inhibitor cocktail and PhosSTOP phosphatase inhibitor cocktail ( Roche Applied Science , Branford , CT ) , was spun at 25 , 000 xg ( 2\u2009hr ) . The supernatant was incubated with M2 anti-FLAG beads ( Sigma-Aldrich , St . Louis , MO ) ( 2\u2009hr , 4\u00b0C ) . The non-specifically bound proteins were removed by washing extensively with buffer A . FLAG-huntingtin was eluted with buffer ( 50\u2009mM Tris-HCl pH 8 . 0 , 300\u2009mM NaCl , 5% glycerol ) containing 0 . 4 mg/ml FLAG peptide and loaded onto a calibrated Superose 6 10/300 column ( GE Healthcare , Little Chalfont , UK ) equilibrated with 50\u2009mM Tris-HCl pH 8 . 0 and 150\u2009mM NaCl . FLAG-huntingtin eluted discretely and was estimated to be at least 90% pure by Coomassie staining . To generate non-FLAG-tagged huntingtin , M2-bead bound huntingtin proteins were resuspended in buffer ( 20\u2009mM HEPES , 150\u2009mM NaCl , 0 . 5\u2009mM EDTA , 0 . 25\u2009mM DTT ) and incubated with AcTEV protease ( Invitrogen ) for 5\u2009hr at 25\u00b0C . The huntingtin proteins without FLAG-tag were released from the M2-bead and further purified using the same procedure as mentioned above . Comparative analyses of huntingtin proteins with varying polyglutamine sizes were performed with an equal amount of each protein , verified by Bio-Rad DC protein assay ( Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc , Hercules , CA ) and R-250 Coomassie blue staining of bands on 10% SDS PAGE to control for potential differences in protein purity and amount . The molarity for all huntingtins was calculated using a molecular weight of 350\u2009kDa deduced from the human cDNA sequence . 50\u2013100 ng of purified protein was run on a 10% Bis-Tris gel and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes . All antibodies were blocked with 5% milk/TBST . Anti-huntingtin antibodies were used at dilutions of 1:2000 ( mAB2166 ) and 1:5000 ( HF-1 ) . mAb1F8 antibody targeting the polyglutamine region was used at 1:10 , 000 dilution . After washing , the blots were probed with anti-Rabbit HRP secondary antibodies and developed using the ECL system . mAb2166 was purchased from Millipore ( EMD Millipore , Darmstadt , Germany ) , whereas rabbit polyclonal antibodies HF-1 ( against amino acids 1981\u20132580 ) were generated in the laboratory against the fusion protein , as previously reported ( Persichetti et al . , 1995; Persichetti et al . , 1996 ) . mAb1F8 antibody was also generated in the laboratory as previously reported ( Persichetti et al . , 1999 ) . Streptavidin-HRP was obtained from Cell Signaling Technology ( Danvers , MA ) . Purified full-length human huntingtins with different polyglutamine tract lengths ( 0 . 2 mg/ml ) were dialyzed against 100\u2009mM phosphate buffer pH 7 . 2 before CD analysis . Far-UV CD spectra were obtained by scanning from 260 nm to 185 nm at 25\u00b0C on a 410 AVIV spectropolarimeter ( Lakewood , NJ ) using a 1\u2009mm quartz cuvette ( Hellma , Plainview , NY ) placed in a thermally controlled cell holder . The machine was equipped with a Peltier junction thermal device and a Thermo Neslab M25 circulating bath . Spectra were obtained with a wavelength step of 1 nm , an averaging time of 3\u2009s for each data point and 30\u2009s equilibration time between points . The data were calculated and plotted with Graphpad Prism software v . 4 . 01 . Concentrations of proteins were checked by absorbance at 280 nm prior to the experiment . The CD data was normalized for concentration to allow for a comparative analysis , and presented in the units of deg . cm2/dmole . The thermal dependence of the CD was carried out for each protein by heating in 5\u00b0C steps from 25 to 95\u00b0C , with the wavelength set at 222 nm . The deconvolution of the CD curves to estimate secondary structure is not presented , as there is currently no reference database of HEAT-repeat proteins with known X-ray structure to make an accurate evaluation . Full-length FLAG-tag huntingtins were applied to ultracentrifugation at 74 , 329 xg for 16\u2009hr with a 5\u201320% sucrose gradient in presence of a 0\u20130 . 2% glutaraldehyde gradient . A fraction containing only the monomeric huntingtin was collected and the protein was then negatively-stained with 2% ( w/v ) uranyl acetate for 2\u2009min on 400 mesh carbon grids . Images were collected at 50 , 000x magnification with a defocus value of 0 . 5\u20131 . 5\u2009\u03bcm on a 4x4K CCD camera ( Tietz Vieo and imaging Processing System ) attached to a Jeol JEM2100F filed emission gun transmission electron microscope at 200 kV . Data were processed using EMAN2 program ( Thakur et al . , 2009 ) . For the huntingtin-FLAG Antibody complexes , FLAG-antibody ( Sigma-Aldrich , St . Louis , MO ) and huntingtin were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C and only the antibody bound monomer of huntingtin was isolated as for huntingtin alone . Total 10 , 169 , 9368 , 4714 , and 3239 particles were selected for Q23-huntingtin , Q78-huntingtin , Q23-huntingtin FLAG-antibody , and Q78-huntingtin FLAG-antibody , respectively . The selected particles were used for further processing to generate reference-free class-averages . The models were further iteratively refined with a low-pass-filter ( cutoff=0 . 033 ) . Four refined models were superimposed and difference maps between Q23-huntingtin , Q78-huntingtin alone and Q23-huntingtin- , Q78-huntingtin-Flag antibody complex , were calculated by Chimera ( Pettersen et al . , 2004 ) , respectively . In order to prepare the cross-linked huntingtins , Q23- , Q46- or Q78-huntingtin ( 200 \u00b5g , 1 . 0 mg/ml ) were incubated with 1\u2009mM of DSS-H12/D12 ( Creative Molecules Inc . ) for 20 min at 37\u00b0C with mild shaking . The cross-linking reaction was stopped by adding ammonium bicarbonate to a final concentration of 50\u2009mM . Then , each cross-linked huntingtin was separated by ultracentrifugation at 111 , 541 xg for 16\u2009hr with 10\u201330% sucrose gradient in 20\u2009mM HEPES and 100\u2009mM NaCl buffer . Only the monomeric population was collected ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1 ) and evaporated to dryness for XL-MS analysis . Approximately 50\u2009\u03bcg of cross-linked huntingtins ( Q23 , Q46 and Q78 ) forms were separately redissolved in 75 \u00b5l 8\u2009M urea . Potential disulfide bonds were reduced by addition of 5 \u00b5l of 50\u2009mM tris ( 2-carboxyethyl ) phosphine , followed by incubation for 30\u2009min at 37\u00b0C , and free thiol groups were subsequently alkylated by the addition of 5 \u00b5l of a 100\u2009mM iodoacetamide solution and incubation for 30\u2009min at 23\u00b0C in the dark . For the two-step protease digestion , the samples were first diluted with 50 \u00b5l of 150\u2009mM ammonium bicarbonate solution and 0 . 6 \u00b5g of endoproteinase Lys-C ( Wako , Richmond , VA ) was added . Lys-C digestion was carried out for 3\u2009hr at 37\u00b0C . The samples were then further diluted by addition of 640 \u00b5l of 50\u2009mM ammonium bicarbonate solution ( final urea concentration = 1\u2009M ) and 1 . 2 \u00b5g of sequencing-grade trypsin ( Promega , Madison , WI ) was added . Trypsin digestion proceeded overnight at 37\u00b0C . Enzymatic digestion was stopped by addition of pure formic acid to 2% , v/v , and samples were purified by solid-phase extraction ( SPE ) using 50 mg Sep-Pak tC18 cartridges ( Waters , Milford , MA ) using standard procedures . The SPE eluates were evaporated to dryness in a vacuum centrifuge . Digests of cross-linked huntingtins were fractionated by size exclusion chromatography ( SEC ) as described ( Leitner et al . , 2012; 2014 ) . Three fractions were collected and subjected to LC-MS/MS analysis on a Thermo Orbitrap Elite mass spectrometer as described previously ( Greber et al . , 2014 ) . Cross-linked peptides were identified from the MS/MS spectra using xQuest ( Walzthoeni et al . , 2012 ) with the following settings: Enzyme = trypsin , maximum number of missed cleavages = 2 , cross-linking site = K and mass shifts for the cross-linking reagent DSS-d0/d12 . A sequence database was constructed from an independent search of an unfractionated sample against the UniProt/SwissProt database with Mascot ( Perkins et al . , 1999 ) . The final database contained the huntingtin sequence and 13 identified low-level contaminants . xQuest search results were filtered according to the following criteria: mass error < 4 ppm , minimum peptide length = 6 residues , delta score < 0 . 9 , % TIC \u2265 0 . 1 , minimum number of bond cleavages per peptides = 4 . An xQuest score cut-off of 17 was selected , corresponding to an estimated false discovery rate of < 5% . In addition to the cross-links on huntingtin , only one cross-link on a contaminant protein ( HSP7C_DROME ) was identified .", "headings": ["Abstract", "Introduction", "Results", "Discussion", "Materials and methods"], "keywords": ["structural biology and molecular biophysics", "neuroscience"], "id": "elife-11184-v2"}
{"lay_summary": "The cells of nearly all organisms need iron as this metal plays an important role in a wide range of biological processes . However , iron can also trigger the formation of harmful molecules that can damage cells . It is therefore crucial that the amount of iron in cells is tightly controlled and that any extra iron is safely stored away . Most of the iron in the body is stored within a protein called ferritin , which is then broken down to release iron as it is needed , in a process known as ferritinophagy . Cells use several systems to break down proteins , one of which , called autophagy , has been linked to ferritinophagy . During autophagy , a bubble-like structure called an autophagosome engulfs proteins that need to be removed and delivers them to a compartment in the cell where they can be broken down . In 2014 , researchers showed that a protein called NCOA4 on the surface of autophagosomes targets ferritin for destruction . When iron levels are high in the cell , the amount of NCOA4 on the autophagosomes is low . This leads to fewer ferritin molecules being broken down . In contrast , low iron levels lead to an increase of NCOA4 on autophagosomes , which promotes ferritinophagy and increases the amount of iron in the cell . Now , Mancias , Vaites et al\u2014including several of the researchers involved in the 2014 work\u2014investigate the role of NCOA4 in ferritinophagy in more detail . Biochemical experiments revealed that a region of NCOA4 directly interacts with a particular subunit of ferritin and this interaction is necessary to deliver ferritin to autophagosomes . Mancias , Vaites et al . then used laboratory grown-cells to investigate why the amount of NCOA4 changes in response to the amount of iron in the cell . The experiments show the amount of NCOA4 varies depending on whether it interacts with another protein called HERC2 , which targets proteins for destruction by a structure called the proteasome . HERC2 only binds to NCOA4 when iron levels are high , which leads to NCOA4 being broken down by the proteasome . When iron levels are low , HERC2 does not interact with NCOA4 . The presence of more NCOA4 then leads to more ferritinophagy , and so increases the amount of iron in the cell . Mancias , Vaites et al . also found that red blood cells , which depend highly on iron , do not develop properly in zebrafish that have lower amounts of the NCOA4 protein . Further work is needed to see whether NCOA4 is also important for the development of other cells and tissues .", "article": "NCOA4 is a selective cargo receptor for the autophagic turnover of ferritin , a process critical for regulation of intracellular iron bioavailability . However , how ferritinophagy flux is controlled and the roles of NCOA4 in iron-dependent processes are poorly understood . Through analysis of the NCOA4-FTH1 interaction , we demonstrate that direct association via a key surface arginine in FTH1 and a C-terminal element in NCOA4 is required for delivery of ferritin to the lysosome via autophagosomes . Moreover , NCOA4 abundance is under dual control via autophagy and the ubiquitin proteasome system . Ubiquitin-dependent NCOA4 turnover is promoted by excess iron and involves an iron-dependent interaction between NCOA4 and the HERC2 ubiquitin ligase . In zebrafish and cultured cells , NCOA4 plays an essential role in erythroid differentiation . This work reveals the molecular nature of the NCOA4-ferritin complex and explains how intracellular iron levels modulate NCOA4-mediated ferritinophagy in cells and in an iron-dependent physiological setting . \n Iron is essential for the survival of nearly all organisms as it serves as a cofactor for a host of biochemical processes including oxygen storage , oxidative phosphorylation , and enzymatic reactions required for cellular proliferation ( Pantopoulos et al . , 2012 ) . However , the levels of free iron in a cell must be tightly controlled to avoid the generation of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) via the Fenton reaction ( Dixon and Stockwell , 2014 ) . As such , iron metabolism is a tightly regulated process controlled by a network of iron-dependent proteins ( Pantopoulos et al . , 2012 ) . The cell has evolved mechanisms whereby iron can be sequestered and released from protein complexes in response to changing iron levels ( Anderson et al . , 2012 ) . One such protein is ferritin , which forms a complex of 24 subunits ( consisting of a mixture of ferritin heavy and light chains , FTH1 and FTL , respectively ) capable of storing up to 4500 iron atoms ( Arosio et al . , 2009 ) . When iron levels in the cell are low , ferritin is degraded allowing the release of iron for use by the cell . Ferritin is degraded in the lysosome and recent evidence implicated autophagy , a conserved catabolic cellular pathway , in the \u2018ferritinophagy\u2019 process ( Radisky and Kaplan , 1998; Asano et al . , 2011 ) . Through quantitative proteomic analysis of purified autophagosomes , we recently identified NCOA4 as the selective autophagy receptor that targets ferritin to the autophagosome , providing the first mechanistic explanation of how ferritinophagy occurs ( Mancias et al . , 2014 ) . We further showed that NCOA4-mediated ferritinophagy is important for maintaining cellular iron homeostasis . NCOA4 was subsequently identified as an ubiquitylation target when the VPS34 autophagy activator is inhibited and also was found to promote ferritinophagy ( Dowdle et al . , 2014 ) . Three central questions emerge from this work . First , what molecular determinants drive the pathway and are the interactions between NCOA4 and ferritin direct ? Interestingly , NCOA4 has been reported to bind FTH1 , but not FTL , in cell extracts ( Dowdle et al . , 2014 ) ; however , the biochemical basis of this specificity is unclear , especially given that FTH1 and FTL are 53% identical and 66% similar in primary sequence . In most cell types , ferritin complexes are composed of both heavy and light chains . The identification of point mutants that specifically abolish these interactions could facilitate a further dissection of NCOA4 function . Second , given that NCOA4 levels appear to control flux through the ferritinophagy pathway , what mechanisms control the abundance of NCOA4 ? We previously reported that NCOA4 levels are altered by intracellular iron status ( Mancias et al . , 2014 ) ; when iron levels are high , NCOA4 abundance is low , thereby promoting ferritin accumulation and iron capture . But when iron is low , NCOA4 levels increase to promote ferritinophagy . However , our understanding of the mechanisms underlying these processes is limited and is complicated by the fact that the pool of NCOA4 participating in targeting ferritin to autophagosomes is apparently degraded within lysosomes . Thus , understanding the mechanisms that control NCOA4 abundance could help unravel the physiological underpinnings of flux through the ferritinophagy pathway , with implications for understanding iron utilization . Our recent work revealed HERC2 , a large multi-domain homologous to E6AP carboxy terminus ( HECT ) E3 ubiquitin ligase , as an NCOA4-interacting protein ( Mancias et al . , 2014 ) . HERC2 is reported to associate with numerous proteins and likely has multiple ubiquitylation targets , including E6AP and proteins linked to DNA damage ( Bekker-Jensen et al . , 2010; Martinez-Noel et al . , 2012; Moroishi et al . , 2014; Galligan et al . , 2015 ) . Intriguingly , HERC2 associates with the SCFFBLX5 ubiquitin ligase ( Tan et al . , 2013 ) and has recently been implicated in the basal turnover of FBXL5 ( Moroishi et al . , 2014 ) , a key iron-sensing protein that promotes turnover of the ferritin translational repressor IRP2 ( Iron Regulatory Protein 2 , also known as IREB2 ) when iron is high ( Salahudeen et al . , 2009; Vashisht et al . , 2009 ) . However , the precise role that HERC2 , iron , and the ubiquitin system play in regulating NCOA4 , and how this is related to NCOA4 autophagic turnover during ferritinophagy remains unexplored . Third , what is the physiological role of NCOA4 in cellular processes that are highly dependent upon iron availability ? Initial links between NCOA4 and processes with a requirement for high iron availability come from expression studies where ncoa4 mRNA is high at sites of erythropoiesis during zebrafish development ( Weber et al . , 2005 ) . Moreover , recent transcriptomic analysis shows significant upregulation of NCOA4 at the orthochromatic erythroblast stage of erythroid differentiation in humans , the stage associated with massive heme and hemoglobin synthesis , a highly iron dependent process ( An et al . , 2014 ) . Prior studies have demonstrated defects in erythroid differentiation upon deletion of canonical autophagy genes ( Cao et al . , 2015 ) ; however , these studies focused on an inability to clear mitochondria during erythroid maturation due to dysfunctional mitophagy ( Mortensen et al . , 2010; Li-Harms et al . , 2015 ) . While it is clear that iron obtained via holo-transferrin endocytosis is used for heme synthesis during erythroid differentiation , there is debate as to the intracellular itinerary of this iron once liberated from transferrin ( Lane et al . , 2015 ) . There is evidence that transferrin-liberated endosomal iron is transferred directly to mitochondria ( Sheftel et al . , 2007 ) ; however , additional studies show that ferritin-sequestered iron is also utilized for heme synthesis ( Vaisman et al . , 1997 ) . Here , we use in-depth biochemical and cell culture studies , as well as the zebrafish system to dissect the roles of NCOA4 , Ferritin , and HERC2 in mediating ferritinophagy and the role of ferritinophagy in erythropoiesis . We show that NCOA4 interacts directly with FTH1 via a conserved NCOA4 C-terminal domain and a key conserved residue on FTH1 . Mutation at these binding sites abrogates binding in vivo and abolishes ferritinophagy . We show that the HERC2 ligase uses its \u2018CUL7-homology domain\u2019 to recognize NCOA4 under high iron conditions to mediate NCOA4 turnover via the ubiquitin-proteasome system , thereby reducing the steady-state NCOA4 levels and increasing ferritin for iron capture . Surprisingly , we find that this same C-terminal domain within NCOA4 binds iron and the iron-bound state of NCOA4 determines HERC2 binding , suggesting an iron-dependent switch in NCOA4 turnover . Finally , we show that NCOA4 is important for erythropoiesis in vivo given its role in mobilizing iron from ferritin for use in heme synthesis . This study establishes the importance of NCOA4 as a critical regulator of cellular and organismal iron metabolism and reveals the mechanistic underpinnings of its iron-dependent regulation . \n There is little structural information available for NCOA4 apart from predicted coiled coil domains at the N-terminus . While NCOA4 orthologs exist throughout metazoans , there is minimal sequence homology within the proteome . Sequence alignment , secondary structure prediction , and tertiary structure prediction were used to design NCOA4 fragments for identification of the ferritin-binding domain ( Figure 1A ) . The N-terminus of NCOA4 consists of predicted coiled coil domains that have been previously shown to mediate oligomerization of NCOA4 ( Monaco et al . , 2001 ) . This domain is present in both NCOA4 splice variants , encoding a 614-residue \u03b1 isoform and a 287-residue \u03b2 isoform ( Alen et al . , 1999 ) . We therefore tested binding of purified apoferritin from horse spleen ( containing both FTH1 and FTL ) in vitro to recombinant full-length Myc-tagged NCOA4\u03b1 , NCOA4\u03b2 ( to rule out a folded motif consisting of the N-terminus and a short portion of the C-terminus ) , NCOA4-N-terminus ( NCOA41\u2212245 ) , and NCOA4-C-terminus ( NCOA4235\u2212614 ) . Ferritin associated with both NCOA4\u03b1 and the NCOA4 C-terminal fragment but not with NCOA4\u03b2 or the NCOA4 N-terminal fragment ( Figure 1B ) . Further truncation constructs were designed based on secondary structure prediction and ferritin binding in vitro was mapped to NCOA4 amino acids 383\u2013522 ( NCOA4383\u2212522 , Figure 1A , C , D ) . This portion of NCOA4 is predicted to contain four \u03b1-helices and constitutes a discrete sub-domain of NCOA4 not present in NCOA4\u03b2 . To determine if a discrete portion of this region binds ferritin , we made further truncation constructs and demonstrated binding to amino acids 475\u2013522 ( Figure 1C , D ) . There was a significant loss of binding efficiency to ferritin when further truncation constructs were tested; however , residual binding was seen with amino acids 485\u2013509 ( Figure 1D , Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A ) . Given the overlapping nature of truncation constructs in this experiment , we tested whether deletion of amino acids 490\u2013499 within the NCOA4383\u2212522 construct affected binding in vitro . This construct completely abrogated binding ( Figure 1F ) . Alanine scanning mutagenesis across this region identified W497 and to a lesser extent I489 , S492 , L494 , and L498 as important residues for ferritin binding ( Figure 1E , F ) . Mutation of I489 and W497 ( NCOA4I489/W497A ) in the context of NCOA4383\u2212522 abrogated binding to ferritin ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B ) . Thus , NCOA4 associates directly with ferritin in vitro and employs sequences in a predicted helical domain for this interaction . 10 . 7554/eLife . 10308 . 003Figure 1 .

FTH1/LAMP2 localization was visualized by confocal microscopy . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 10308 . 004 We next examined the ability of NCOA4I489A/W497A to bind endogenous ferritin in HCT116 cells and evaluated whether mutant NCOA4 was capable of facilitating ferritin delivery to lysosomes upon iron depletion . Because dimerization with endogenous NCOA4 could confound analysis of mutants , we utilized CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing ( Ran et al . , 2013 ) to engineer NCOA4-deficient clonal HCT116 cell lines . Two independent clones were obtained and analyzed for NCOA4 protein expression ( Figure 1G ) . To determine whether mutant NCOA4 binds ferritin in cells , we stably expressed C-terminally tagged ( CTAP ) wild type or NCOA4I489A/W497A in control or NCOA4-deficient HCT116 cells , followed by FLAG affinity purification to purify tagged NCOA4 . Consistent with in vitro data , ferritin binding to NCOA4I489A/W497A ( as monitored by FTH1 immunoblotting ) is abrogated in NCOA4-deficient cells , and a significant reduction in binding to ferritin is observed in control cells expressing endogenous NCOA4 , apparently reflecting oligomerization of ectopically expressed NCOA4I489A/W497A with endogenous NCOA4 present in the immune complex ( Figure 1H ) . Given that NCOA4I489A/W497A displayed a dramatic decrease in ferritin binding when expressed in cells , we next evaluated whether cells expressing this mutant undergo ferritinophagy upon iron depletion . Control or NCOA4-deficient cells stably expressing wild type or NCOA4I489A/W497A were loaded with ferric ammonium citrate ( FAC ) for 14 hr , followed by iron chelation using deferoxamine ( DFO ) for 6 hr in the presence of lysosomal protease inhibitors . While NCOA4-deficient cells expressing wild type NCOA4 exhibit punctate lysosomal ferritin localization as shown previously ( Dowdle et al . , 2014; Mancias et al . , 2014 ) cells expressing NCOA4I489A/W497A exhibit diffuse cytoplasmic ferritin staining , indicating defective ferritinophagy in the presence of mutant NCOA4 ( Figure 1I , Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C ) . Our data indicates that NCOA4383\u2212522 , including hydrophobic residues I489 and W497 , is required for association with ferritin and productive ferritinophagy in cells . Ferritin complexes in vivo are composed of 24 subunits of FTH1 and FTL , with varying ratios depending on the cell type . We initially identified both FTH1 and FTL as binding partners of NCOA4 and confirmed a reciprocal interaction by FTH1 pulldown ( Mancias et al . , 2014 ) . While Dowdle et al . recently showed that NCOA4 appears to selectively recognize the FTH1 subunit of ferritin in vivo ( Dowdle et al . , 2014 ) , it remains unclear whether the NCOA4-ferritin interaction occurs in a direct manner or requires intermediate factors for binding . While the above experiments with purified ferritin from horse spleen and recombinant NCOA4 suggested a direct interaction , we subsequently produced recombinant FTH1-only and FTL-only ferritin complexes and tested for direct interactions with recombinant NCOA4 . NCOA4 specifically recognizes recombinant FTH1 , confirming the prior specificity and also demonstrating that NCOA4 recognizes FTH1 directly ( Figure 2A ) . As NCOA4 interacts with the 450 kDa ferritin complex ( Dowdle et al . , 2014 ) , we predicted that NCOA4 binds to the surface of ferritin and that differences in FTH1 vs FTL surface residues dictate NCOA4 specificity for FTH1 . We identified 16 FTH1 surface residues that were conserved among FTH1 orthologs but not FTL ( Figure 2B ) ( Lawson et al . , 1991; Hempstead et al . , 1997 ) . We performed alanine mutagenesis of these 16 residues individually , expressed them recombinantly in Escherichia coli , purified 450 kDa complexes for all mutants as determined by gel filtration analysis , and tested binding to NCOA4 in NCOA4-GST pulldowns . Critically , FTH1R23A mutation abrogated binding to NCOA4383\u2212522 but none of the other residues tested had a negative effect on NCOA4-FTH1 binding in these assays ( Figure 2C ) . Importantly , purified FTH1R23A forms 450 kDa ferritin complexes , similar to FTH1WT ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A , B ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 10308 . 005Figure 2 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 10308 . 006 To determine whether FTH1 R23 is required to support NCOA4 association with ferritin complexes in cells , we first generated FTH1-deficient cells using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing . Three independent FTH1-deficient HCT116 cell lines were obtained , as evidenced by loss of FTH1 protein expression and PCR genotyping ( Figure 2D , Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C ) . We stably expressed N-terminally FLAG-HA tagged ( NTAP ) wild type and FTH1R23A in control or FTH1-deficient HCT116 cells , followed by FLAG affinity purification to isolate FLAG-FTH1 complexes and examine endogenous NCOA4 binding . While FTH1R23A is unable to associate with NCOA4 , binding to FTL is maintained , indicating that mutant FTH1 is capable of forming FTH/FTL complexes ( Figure 2E , Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C ) . Moreover , GFP-FTH1R23A expressed in FTH1-deficient cells fails to localize to punctate lysosomal structures , consistent with an inability to bind the NCOA4 cargo receptor ( Figure 2F ) . Thus , binding of NCOA4 to FTH1 involves a basic residue located on the surface of the complex but not present in FTL . Our previous work revealed that NCOA4 delivers ferritin complexes to the autophagosome for degradation ( Mancias et al . , 2014 ) . Since aberrant degradation of ferritin in lysosomes would be deleterious to the cell when intracellular iron is high , we next sought to elucidate the mechanism whereby cells suppress NCOA4-mediated ferritinophagy under iron-replete conditions . We previously noted that NCOA4 levels are altered by iron status; when iron is high , NCOA4 abundance is low thereby promoting ferritin accumulation , and when iron is low , NCOA4 levels are high , thereby promoting ferritinophagy ( Mancias et al . , 2014 ) . We noted that previous interaction proteomics revealed the large HECT E3 ligase HERC2 as a high confidence NCOA4 interacting protein ( Mancias et al . , 2014 ) . We hypothesized that HERC2 may regulate NCOA4 levels via the ubiquitin-proteasome system . Indeed , previous proteomics experiments identified multiple ubiquitylation sites on NCOA4 ( Kim et al . , 2011; Dowdle et al . , 2014 ) . We further reasoned that the iron-dependent regulation of NCOA4 levels may be a result of iron-dependent recognition of NCOA4 by HERC2 . Therefore we first examined the binding of endogenous HERC2 to NCOA4 in cells under iron replete and deficient conditions . Cells were treated with iron chelator ( DFO ) , or loaded with excess iron ( FAC ) followed by HERC2 or NCOA4 immunoprecipitation ( IP ) . Immunoblot analysis of endogenous NCOA4 revealed an interaction with HERC2 under basal cell culture conditions where iron is replete and that this interaction was enhanced under excess iron conditions . Conversely , HERC2 binding to NCOA4 was severely attenuated following iron chelation ( Figure 3A ) . We also examined endogenous HERC2 binding to stably expressed NCOA4-FLAG-HA ( CTAP ) tagged protein under iron replete and deficient conditions . Immunoblot analysis of endogenous HERC2 revealed an interaction in iron replete and excess iron conditions , while HERC2 binding to NCOA4 was attenuated following iron chelation ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 10308 . 007Figure 3 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 10308 . 008 To define the region of HERC2 that recognizes NCOA4 , we sub-cloned and expressed six fragments spanning the HERC2 open reading frame as depicted in Figure 3B ( Bekker-Jensen et al . , 2010 ) . Endogenous NCOA4 associated with Fragment 3 ( HERC2F3 , amino acids 1700\u20132800; Figure 3C , D ) , comprised of a homology region shared by HERC2 and Mindbomb E3 ligases and the CUL7 CPH domain ( conserved domain in CUL7 , PARC , and HERC2 proteins ) ( Itoh et al . , 2003; Kasper et al . , 2006; Kaustov et al . , 2007 ) . Further mapping of the HERC2 sequence between amino acids 1700\u20132800 revealed a strong interaction between endogenous NCOA4 and HERC2F3\u22126 , corresponding to the CUL7 homology domain and an unstructured region of HERC2 ( residues 2540\u20132700 , Figure 3E ) . Iron chelation also abrogated binding of NCOA4 to exogenously expressed HERC2 ( Figure 3F ) . The finding that HERC2 predominantly associates with NCOA4 when intracellular iron is high led us to examine whether HERC2 modulates NCOA4 stability , thereby reducing flux through the ferritinophagy pathway . Our previous work revealed a reduction in NCOA4 protein expression upon excess iron loading ( Mancias et al . , 2014 ) . Knockdown of HERC2 using two independent siRNAs resulted in accumulation of NCOA4 protein ( Figure 3G ) . Furthermore , siRNA-mediated HERC2 depletion promoted a significant increase in NCOA4 half-life ( Figure 3H , I ) . Further supporting a role for HERC2 in regulating NCOA4 stability in the presence of high intracellular iron , overexpression of HERC2F3\u22126 abrogated NCOA4 loss following excess iron loading likely through interfering with the binding of NCOA4 to endogenous HERC2 ( Figure 3J ) . Similarly , HERC2 knockdown stabilized NCOA4 following FAC treatment ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B ) . Notably , HERC2 depletion did not result in complete stabilization of NCOA4 turnover . Consistently , pre-treatment of cells with the proteasome inhibitor Bortezomib ( Btz ) only partly rescued NCOA4 turnover in response to cycloheximide ( CHX ) treatment ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C ) . Likewise , pre-treatment of cells with the autophagy inhibitor bafilomycin ( Baf ) only partly rescued NCOA4 turnover in response to CHX treatment ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1D ) . We determined that in addition to HERC2-dependent turnover , NCOA4 also undergoes turnover via basal autophagy . Under iron deficient conditions , despite continued autophagic turnover , the apparent lack of HERC2 action on NCOA4 leads to a net increase in NCOA4 protein level thereby promoting ferritinophagy to release iron from ferritin for use by the cell . Using recombinant proteins , we subsequently mapped HERC2 binding to NCOA4383\u2212522 , the same region as is necessary for FTH1 binding ( Figure 4A ) . Efforts to map the interaction to a sub-domain of NCOA4383\u2212522 were unsuccessful and suggest that the binding requires a folded epitope on NCOA4 . Notably , mutation of residues I489 and W497 had no effect on binding to HERC2 ( Figure 1H ) suggesting a HERC2 binding site distinct from that for FTH1 . We further mapped the binding on HERC2 to the minimal CUL7 domain ( amino acids 2553\u20132639; Figure 4B ) . Similar to in vivo studies , this interaction was dependent on a chelatable iron ion as DFO attenuated binding in vitro ( Figure 4C ) . The dependence of the HERC2-NCOA4 interaction on iron levels suggests that either the complex or the individual components bind an iron molecule . While neither NCOA4 nor the HERC2 CUL7 domain have predicted iron binding sites ( Passerini et al . , 2011 ) , inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry ( ICP-MS ) analysis showed that iron co-purified with a recombinant fragment of NCOA4383\u2212509 , but not the HERC2 CUL7 domain or buffer alone ( Figure 4C , Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A , B ) . Thus , NCOA4 ( through residues 383\u2013509 ) can function as an iron-binding protein and its ability to interact with HERC2 in cells is anticipated to depend on the level of bioavailable iron . 10 . 7554/eLife . 10308 . 009Figure 4 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 10308 . 010 Previous studies suggest that NCOA4 has a role in erythropoiesis due to the timing and pattern of expression ( Weber et al . , 2005; Nilsson et al . , 2009; An et al . , 2014 ) . We therefore examined the role of NCOA4 in a K562 erythroleukemia cell culture model of hemin-induced erythroid differentiation . NCOA4 shRNA-mediated knockdown abrogated increases in hemoglobin mRNA and protein levels in comparison to shGFP lines upon hemin differentiation ( Figure 5A\u2013C ) . Hemoglobinization was likewise severely affected . The dark brown coloration of NCOA4 shRNA pellets suggests accumulation of iron-laden ferritin with inability to release iron for subsequent heme synthesis ( Figure 5D ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 10308 . 011Figure 5 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 10308 . 011 We next confirmed ncoa4 is expressed at sites of hematopoiesis in zebrafish as previously published ( Weber et al . , 2005 ) including in the intermediate cell mass ( ICM ) at 24 hpf ( hours post-fertilization ) , a structure that is equivalent to the mouse yolk sac E7 . 5\u201310 . 0 . At 48 and 72 hpf , ncoa4 is expressed in circulating erythrocytes visible in the yolk sac , heart , and liver ( L ) ( Figure 5E ) . Consistent with its expression in sites of hematopoiesis and circulating erythrocytes , morpholino knockdown of ncoa4 severely disrupts erythropoiesis as visualized at 30 hpf in globin-LCR:eGFP transgenic zebrafish , which express GFP in erythroid cells ( Ganis et al . , 2012 ) ( Figure 5F ) . Morphants exhibit severe reduction in circulating GFP-labeled erythroid cells ( Figure 5G ) . Furthermore , hemoglobinization as visualized by o-dianisidine staining was severely reduced using two independent morpholinos to ncoa4 ( Figure 5H ) . Taken together these findings suggest that during erythroid differentiation , the majority of iron obtained via endocytosed holo-transferrin is stored in ferritin before mobilization via NCOA4-mediated ferritinophagy for heme synthesis . \n Our data reveal that HERC2 associates with NCOA4 in an iron-dependent manner , and for the first time , provide evidence that NCOA4 itself is an iron-sensing protein capable of coordinating iron via a C-terminal helical domain . While the sheer size of HERC2 precludes traditional in vitro studies , we demonstrate that HERC2 ablation or overexpression of HERC2F3\u22126 ( amino acids 2540\u20132700 containing the NCOA4 binding site ) stabilizes endogenous NCOA4 under iron-replete conditions . We noted that NCOA4 remains unstable , albeit with significantly slower kinetics , upon HERC2 depletion , and pre-treatment with the proteasome inhibitor Bortezomib rescues , but does not completely restore NCOA4 protein expression following CHX treatment . Likewise , blockade of autophagy only partially stabilizes NCOA4 . These data indicate that NCOA4 levels are under the control of dual autophagic and proteasomal systems , and both are operative in the setting of intermediate iron levels as observed under typical cell culture conditions . Turnover through autophagy could be linked specifically to its capture during the process of ferritinophagy , although we cannot rule out the possibility that NCOA4 also has additional cargo that may also contribute to its flux through the autophagy system . When iron is available , the iron bound pool of NCOA4 can be targeted for ubiquitylation by HERC2 , leading to NCOA4 turnover through the proteasome . When iron levels are low , such as modeled here by chelation , a pool of NCOA4 is liberated from the grasp of HERC2 and may then participate in trafficking of ferritin to the lysosome . Inappropriate depletion or accumulation of FTH1 may also provide insight into the dynamics of NCOA4 turnover . While FTH1 knockout leads to a marked decrease in NCOA4 levels ( Figure 2D ) , likely due to an increase in free iron thereby activating HERC2-mediated turnover , over-expression of wild type FTH1 leads to a marked accumulation of NCOA4 ( Figure 2E , Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C ) . This may be due to an over-abundance of ferritin complexes chelating free iron ( as suggested by a rise in IRP2 levels , Figure 2E , Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C ) ; however , as re-expression of FTH1R23A in FTH1-null cells leads to only a modest increase in NCOA4 there is likely some ability of ferritin complexes to sequester NCOA4 from degradation via HERC2 and even autophagy . A model that depicts multiple modes of regulation of NCOA4 is provided in Figure 6 . The structural determinants of NCOA4 iron binding and how iron is loaded onto NCOA4 have yet to be determined but we do note the presence of multiple conserved cysteine residues throughout NCOA4 that may play a role in iron binding . 10 . 7554/eLife . 10308 . 012Figure 6 . Iron Levels Regulate NCOA4-mediated ferritinophagy . A model of NCOA4 ferritinophagy regulation ( see the text for details ) . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 10308 . 012 The mechanism of NCOA4 regulation by HERC2 contrasts with the recently described role of HERC2 in degradation of the iron-sensing protein FBXL5 , as HERC2-mediated FBXL5 turnover was demonstrated to occur basally , independent of FBXL5 iron binding capacity ( Moroishi et al . , 2014 ) . Upon intracellular iron depletion , FBXL5 is rapidly destabilized via the activity of an unidentified E3 ubiquitin ligase , and loss of HERC2 function cannot restore FBXL5 expression under such conditions ( Moroishi et al . , 2014 ) . FBXL5 loss leads to stabilization of IRP2 , a ferritin translational repressor ( Salahudeen et al . , 2009; Vashisht et al . , 2009 ) . Together , NCOA4-mediated ferritinophagy and IRP2-mediated inhibition of ferritin translation function to mobilize intracellular iron stored within ferritin complexes and prevent further iron storage until intracellular iron levels are restored ( Figure 6 ) . Erythropoiesis is defined by a complex series of differentiation steps beginning with the hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell leading to the mature enucleated discoid erythrocyte replete with hemoglobin . One of the defining aspects of erythroid differentiation is the requirement for massive amounts of iron to support the synthesis of increasing amounts of hemoglobin in the late stages of erythroblast maturation ( An et al . , 2014 ) . Indeed , of the approximately 3\u20135 g of iron in the human body , greater than 2 g is present as heme in hemoglobin of erythrocytes ( Pantopoulos et al . , 2012 ) . While it is clear that iron is delivered to erythroblasts via circulating transferrin and that this iron is required for heme synthesis in the mitochondria , the intracellular itinerary of iron once liberated from transferrin is unclear in the developing erythroblast . Prior studies suggest either direct delivery of endosomal iron to the mitochondria vs an intermediate storage step in ferritin followed by lysosomal degradation of ferritin with subsequent iron release ( Vaisman et al . , 1997; Sheftel et al . , 2007 ) . Our findings suggest that in the developing zebrafish and during hemin-induced erythroid-like K562 differentiation , the majority of iron obtained via endocytosed holo-transferrin is stored in ferritin before release via NCOA4-mediated ferritinophagy . In support of this model is a recent transcriptome analysis showing a significant upregulation of NCOA4 mRNA into the top 25 highest expressed genes at the orthochromatic erythroblast stage of erythroid differentiation , the stage associated with massive heme and hemoglobin synthesis ( An et al . , 2014 ) . While FTL mRNA remains within the top 25 mRNAs expressed throughout all terminal erythroid differentiation steps , FTH1 mRNA peaks at the final two stages ( polychromatic erythroblast and orthochromatic erythroblast ) . As NCOA4 specifically recognizes FTH1 and not FTL , this could suggest that during erythroid development there is a switch in the composition of ferritin complexes from predominantly FTL favoring storage of iron to a mix of FTH1-FTL . At later stages when iron is required for heme biosynthesis , NCOA4 could then more efficiently and with better kinetics target for degradation ferritin complexes with this higher FTH1-FTL ratio . The modulation of NCOA4 transcript levels during erythroid differentiation suggests an additional layer of regulation of NCOA4 at the transcriptional level that we do not yet understand beyond the post-translational roles of HERC2 and autophagy . The recent results from Dowdle et al . support the role of NCOA4 in maintaining iron homeostasis in vivo as ncoa4 knockout led to inappropriate accumulation of iron in mouse splenic macrophages ( Dowdle et al . , 2014 ) . The authors do not specifically note a defect in erythropoiesis in their mice; however , as splenic macrophages play an important role in turnover of senescent red blood cells and a role in maintaining erythropoiesis during pathological erythropoiesis states , this suggests some defect in erythropoiesis for which splenic macrophages may be compensating ( Ramos et al . , 2013 ) . On the other hand , the role of NCOA4 in erythropoiesis could be limited to the setting of embryonic development and stress erythropoiesis which our zebrafish and K562 model systems are best suited to evaluate . Further study of NCOA4 in vivo in specific tissue compartments , including the erythropoietic compartment , will be necessary in order to decipher the role of NCOA4 in not only erythropoiesis but also overall organismal iron metabolism . \n Cells were cultured in a humidified incubator at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 . 293T , U2OS , HCT116 , and K562 cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection ( ATCC , Manassas , VA , United States ) and tested for mycoplasma contamination .

Six fragments spanning the HERC2 ORF cloned in the pFLAG-CMV vector were a gift from Neils Mailand ( University of Copenhagen ) . These fragments served as template for PCR amplification and BP Gateway cloning into pDONR223 . Subsequently , LR reactions were carried out to transfer each fragment into the CMV-driven pHAGE-N-Flag-HA lentiviral vector for expression in cells Fragments 1\u20136 , F1\u2013F6 .

Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats ( CRISPR ) /Cas9-mediated genome editing was used to generate clonal NCOA4 and FTH1 knockout HCT116 cell lines . High-quality gRNA sequences were designed using the crispr . mit . edu resource , and guides were cloned into the pX330 vector ( Addgene ) for simultaneous gRNA and Cas9 expression ( Cong et al . , 2013; Ran et al . , 2013 ) . The following gRNAs were used in our study: NCOA4 ( exon 2 ) \u2014GTCTTAGAAGCCGTGAGGTA and FTH1 ( exon 1 ) \u2014GACCATGGACAGGTAAACGT . Cells were transfected using PEI with p\u00d7330 empty vector ( control ) or p\u00d7330 vector containing gene-specific gRNA , along with our pHAGE-N-FLAG-HA-GFP vector ( harboring puromycin resistance ) . 48 hr post-transfection , cells were treated with 1 \u03bcg/ml puromycin to select for transfected cells followed by limiting dilution plating to obtain 1 cell/well on 96-well plates . Clonal colonies were screened for NCOA4 or FTH1 protein expression by western blotting and targeting was confirmed by sequencing analysis .

For endogenous HERC2 and NCOA4 IPs , 293T cells were treated as indicated , harvested and lysed as noted above . Cleared extracts were subjected to IP with recombinant Protein G Agarose beads ( Invitrogen 15920-010 ) pre-coupled with protein-specific antibodies as described previously . For an IP control , untreated extracts were incubated with Protein G Agarose coupled with Normal Rabbit IgG ( Cell Signaling #2729 ) . To examine endogenous ferritin or GFP-FTH1 localization , cells were plated on glass coverslips , treated as indicated , and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde before immunofluorescence using anti-ferritin or LAMP2 antibodies ( for endogenous staining ) or GFP visualization ( GFP-tagged FTH1 ) . Images were collected using a Yokogawa ( Sugar Land , TX , United States ) CSU-X1 spinning disk confocal with Borealis modification on a Nikon ( Melville , NY , United States ) Ti-E inverted microscope using an X100 Plan ApoNA 1 . 4 objective lens . Images were acquired with a Hamamatsu ( Middlesex , NJ , United States ) ORCA-AG cooled CCD camera controlled with MetaMorph 7 software ( Molecular Devices , Sunnyvale , CA , United States ) . Z-series optical sections were collected with a step size of 0 . 2 \u03bcm , using the internal Nikon Ti-E focus motor and stacked using MetaMorph to construct maximum intensity projections . Myc-tagged NCOA4 protein for experiments in Figure 1B were produced using the 1-step human coupled in vitro translation kit ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , Waltham , MA , United States ) given E . coli expressed NCOA4\u03b1 was insoluble . NCOA4 constructs for Figure 1B were cloned into a Thermo Scientific pT7CFE1-NMyc vector modified for Gateway cloning ( NCOA4\u03b2 was obtained by BP PCR Gateway cloning from a MCF7 cell line cDNA library ) . NCOA4-GST truncation and mutant constructs for the remainder of the paper were expressed using a dual-tagging system of N-terminal His6-Sumo ( His6-Sumo obtained from MRC-PPU , University of Dundee , Plasmid DU40847 ) and C-terminal GST , utilizing both Ni2+-IMAC and glutathione Sepharose chromatography for purification with removal of the His6-Sumo moiety by Senp1 protease cleavage ( MRC-PPU , University of Dundee , Plasmid DU39129 ) . Briefly , plasmids were transformed in E . coli BL21 ( DE3 ) Rosetta cells . Protein expression was induced with 1 mM IPTG for 3 hr at 37\u00b0C . Cells were collected by centrifugation , re-suspended in 25 mM Tris\u2013HCl ( pH 7 . 4 ) , 10% ( wt/vol ) sucrose and lysed with a single freeze\u2013thaw cycle . DNase I was added to reduce the viscosity and following centrifugation , protein was purified by Ni2+-IMAC chromatography . Eluted proteins were subsequently purified using glutathione sepharose beads and the His6-Sumo moiety was cleaved by Senp1 protease . Purified GST-fusion constructs were used for GST-pulldowns as below . FTH1-wild type and mutant , FTL , HERC22540\u22122700 , HERC22553\u22122639 , HERC22631\u22122739 , and NCOA4383\u2212509 were produced as C-terminal fusions to His6-Sumo . Proteins were purified by Ni2+-IMAC chromatography followed by cleavage with Senp1 protease . The cleavage reaction was passed over a Ni2+-IMAC \u2018catch\u2019 column , and cleaved protein products were collected in the flow through fractions . Cleaved proteins were purified further with Q-sepharose , and gel filtration chromatography on either a Superose 6 column ( FTH1 and FTL complexes ) or a Superdex 75 column ( HERC2 and NCOA4 proteins ) . Recombinant GST fusion proteins were incubated with 10 \u03bcl of a 50% ( vol/vol ) slurry of glutathione Sepharose 4B ( GE Healthcare , Pittsburgh , PA , United States ) beads for 30 min at 4\u00b0C . For in vitro translated Myc-tagged NCOA4 proteins , anti-c-Myc agarose affinity gel ( Sigma ) was used . Beads were washed three times with 150 mM NaCl , 20 mM Tris ( pH 7 . 4 ) , 2 mM DTT , 0 . 5% ( wt/vol ) Nonidet P-40 and then mixed with purified proteins as indicated in experiments . For ferritin pulldowns , apoferritin purified from equine spleen ( Sigma A3641 ) was added at either 2 \u03bcg ( for immunoblot-based pulldowns ) or 50 \u03bcg ( for coomassie-based pulldowns ) per pulldown . For recombinant FTH1 , FTL , or HERC2 pulldowns , 50 \u03bcg of purified protein was added per pulldown . The assay mix was incubated for 30 min at 4\u00b0C , and beads were washed four times with 1 ml wash buffer . Proteins were eluted with SDS sample buffer and analyzed by 4\u201320% gradient SDS\u2013PAGE followed by Colloidal Coomassie Blue stain or , for the indicated experiments with immunoblotting using FTH1 antibody . Load lane for each experiment is 5% of the input . Aliquots of buffer only , HERC22553\u22122639 , and NCOA4383\u2212509 mixed with 500 \u03bcl Aristar Ultra nitric acid ( VWR , Radnor , PA , United States ) followed by digestion for 24 hr . Samples were then diluted to 5 ml with deionized water and were analyzed using a dynamic reaction cell-inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer ( DRC-ICP-MS , Elan 6100 , Perkin Elmer , Norwalk , CT , United States ) . Samples were analyzed by the external calibration method using seven standards with concentrations ranging from 0 to 200 parts per billion ( ppb ) . Quality control measures included: analysis of initial calibration verification standard , continuous calibration standard , procedural blanks , and duplicate samples . Reported measurements of Fe in each sample represent the average of 5 measurements . The individual measurements are typically obtained with a relative standard deviation of approximately 2 . 5% or less per sample . K562 cells were transduced with shGFP or shNCOA4 lentivirus , followed by puromycin selection to enrich for shRNA-expressing cells . To promote differentiation cells were treated with 25 \u03bcM hemin for 72 hr .

{"lay_summary": "Part of the brain called the lateral prefrontal cortex has a critical role in many of the processes seen as hallmarks of human cognition , such as reasoning , planning and problem-solving . Individuals with damage to the lateral prefrontal cortex are disorganized and easily distracted , and may show behaviors that are inappropriate for their context . However , the involvement of the lateral prefrontal cortex in such a wide range of processes makes it difficult to study . This in turn presents a significant roadblock to a full understanding of cognition and human intelligence . Of particular interest is whether the lateral prefrontal cortex has a hierarchical organization wherein a region coordinates the roles of other regions , much like the chief executive of a company . Therefore , Nee and D\u2019Esposito set out to map how the lateral prefrontal cortex is organized , and how its different regions communicate with each other to support complex cognition . Brain imaging revealed that the rear ( posterior ) part of the lateral prefrontal cortex processes an individual\u2019s current situation , while the front ( anterior ) prepares for future situations . Areas in the middle process both types of information . These central areas appear to be highly influential as they have stronger connections to the anterior and posterior regions than vice versa . In cognitively demanding situations , the middle areas receive input from both anterior regions ( potentially about future needs ) and posterior regions ( potentially about current needs ) . By combining the two sets of information , the middle areas can select behaviors that take into account both present circumstances and longer-term goals . With this strategic overview , the middle areas of the lateral prefrontal cortex are well positioned to play the part of the brain\u2019s chief executive . Future experiments should test whether the interactions observed between the different regions of the lateral prefrontal cortex are essential for complex planning and thinking . Additional work in animals would improve our understanding of the mechanisms underlying these interactions . Finally , studying how these interactions are altered in disorders such as schizophrenia , where the lateral prefrontal cortex shows abnormal activity , might pave the way for more effective treatments .", "article": "Higher-level cognition depends on the lateral prefrontal cortex ( LPFC ) , but its functional organization has remained elusive . An influential proposal is that the LPFC is organized hierarchically whereby progressively rostral areas of the LPFC process/represent increasingly abstract information facilitating efficient and flexible cognition . However , support for this theory has been limited . Here , human fMRI data revealed rostral/caudal gradients of abstraction in the LPFC . Dynamic causal modeling revealed asymmetrical LPFC interactions indicative of hierarchical processing . Contrary to dominant assumptions , the relative strength of efferent versus afferent connections positioned mid LPFC as the apex of the hierarchy . Furthermore , cognitive demands induced connectivity modulations towards mid LPFC consistent with a role in integrating information for control operations . Moreover , the strengths of these dynamics were related to trait-measured higher-level cognitive ability . Collectively , these results suggest that the LPFC is hierarchically organized with the mid LPFC positioned to synthesize abstract and concrete information to control behavior . \n The prefrontal cortex ( PFC ) is central to higher-level cognition . Damage to the PFC produces severe deficits in goal-directed cognition ( Luria , 1966; Damasio and Anderson , 1993; Lhermitte , 1986 ) and neuroimaging studies have demonstrated the involvement of the PFC across a wide range of tasks ( Duncan and Owen , 2000; Niendam et al . , 2012 ) . Despite its ubiquitous influence , mechanistic insight into PFC function has remained difficult . Progress towards understanding PFC function has been made through the development of organizing principles that describe gradients of function across the full extent of PFC . A prominent organizing principle is that the rostral/caudal axis of the lateral PFC ( LPFC ) is structured according to the level of cognitive control ( Fuster , 1997; Koechlin et al . , 2003; Koechlin and Summerfield , 2007; Badre , 2008; Badre and D'Esposito , 2007; 2009 ) . Mounting evidence from neuroimaging and lesion studies suggests that progressively rostral areas perform progressively higher levels of cognitive control through processing increasingly abstract representations ( Koechlin et al . , 2003; Badre , 2008; Badre and D'Esposito , 2007; 2009; Koechlin and Jubault , 2006; Nee and Brown , 2012; 2013; Koechlin et al . , 1999; Bahlmann et al . , 2014; Azuar et al . , 2014 ) . This organization enables the LPFC to control behavior across multiple timescales including adapting actions according to the prevailing context , and aligning behaviors with longer-term goals and plans ( Fuster , 2001; 2008 ) . While differentiating the functional sensitivities of sub-regions of the LPFC is an important first step , mechanistic insight into how the LPFC supports goal-directed cognition requires understanding intercommunication among LPFC sub-regions . To this end , it has been proposed that the LPFC is organized hierarchically such that more rostral areas exert asymmetrically greater influence upon more caudal areas ( Badre and D'Esposito , 2009 ) . Hierarchical processing confers substantial computational efficiency and flexibility ( Botvinick and Weinstein , 2014; Duncan , 2013; Solway et al . , 2014 ) , and such processing in the LPFC could explain the massive propensity for higher-level cognition found in primates . However , data demonstrating functional hierarchical processing in the LPFC have been limited ( Koechlin et al . , 2003 ) and controversial ( Reynolds et al . , 2012; Crittenden and Duncan , 2014 ) . Furthermore , no data have linked hierarchical processing to its surmised cognitive advantages . Finally , although it has been widely assumed that the rostral-most areas of LPFC are situated at the apex of the hierarchy ( Koechlin and Summerfield , 2007; Badre and D'Esposito , 2009 ) , recent data call this assumption into question ( Goulas et al . , 2014 ) . Hence , understanding whether and how hierarchical processing occurs in the LPFC remains a significant barrier to modeling goal-directed cognition . Here , we examine how interactions within the LPFC support higher-level cognition . To do so , we devised a paradigm to engage the entire LPFC by orthogonally manipulating demands on stimulus domain and cognitive control ( Figure 1 ) . We began by confirming that the rostral/caudal axis of the LPFC operates according to abstraction principles by examining gradients of stimulus domain-generality/specificity , and temporal control over action . Next , we modeled interactions among LPFC sub-regions to examine whether and how cognitive control demands elicit asymmetrical influences indicative of hierarchical processing . Finally , we aimed to establish whether individual differences in hierarchical interactions predict trait-measured higher-level cognitive functioning , consistent with the presumed computational advantage of hierarchical processing . 10 . 7554/eLife . 12112 . 003Figure 1 . Experimental design . ( A ) The design orthogonally manipulated factors of Stimulus Domain ( verbal , spatial ) and two forms of cognitive control: Contextual Control ( low \u2013 Control , Delay; high \u2013 Restart , Dual ) and Temporal Control ( low \u2013 Control , Restart; high \u2013 Delay , Dual ) . These factors were fully crossed in a 2 x 2 x 2 design . ( B ) Cognitive control processes engaged by condition . ( C ) The basic task required participants to judge whether a stimulus followed the previous stimulus in a sequence . The sequence in the verbal task was the order of the letters in the word 'tablet . ' The sequence in the spatial task was a trace of the points of a star . The start of each sequence began with a decision regarding whether the currently viewed stimulus is the start of the sequence ( e . g . \u2018t\u2019 in the verbal task ) . ( D ) Factors were blocked with each block containing a basic task phase , a sub-task phase , a return trial , and a second basic task phase ( not depicted ) , for all but the Control blocks . Control blocks consisted only of the basic task phase extended to match the other conditions in duration . Colored frames indicated whether letters or locations were relevant for the block ( verbal \u2013 purple; spatial \u2013 orange in this example; verbal condition depicted ) . The basic task was cued by square frames . Other frames cued the different sub-task conditions . In the Delay condition ( circle frames ) , participants held in mind the place in the sequence across a distractor-filled delay . In the Restart condition ( diamond frames ) , participants started a new sequence . In the Dual condition ( cross frames ) , participants simultaneously started a new sequence , and maintained the place in the previous sequence .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 12112 . 004 \n To examine behavioral manifestation of cognitive control demands , separate 2 x 2 x 2 ANOVAs were computed on error-rate ( ER ) , and reaction times ( RT ) on correct trials ( Figure 2 ) . These analyses revealed significant effects of cognitive control demands with main effects of Temporal Control ( ER: F ( 1 , 23 ) = 5 . 72 , p<0 . 05; RT: F ( 1 , 23 ) = 28 . 72 , p<0 . 0001 ) , Contextual Control ( ER: F ( 1 , 23 ) = 16 . 21 , p=0 . 0005; RT: F ( 1 , 23 ) = 147 . 79 , p<10\u201311 ) , and their interaction ( ER: F ( 1 , 23 ) = 23 . 78 , p=0 . 0001; RT: F ( 1 , 23 ) = 87 . 16 , p<10\u20138 ) . As anticipated , the interaction was largely driven by fast and accurate performance on the Delay condition , which placed minimal demands on current processing during the sub-task phase . By contrast , there were no main effects of Stimulus Domain or interactions of Stimulus Domain with cognitive control demands ( ER and RT all p>0 . 05 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 12112 . 005Figure 2 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 12112 . 005 Following each sub-task , there was a return trial that required either the integration of an item held across the sub-task ( Delay and Dual conditions ) or a switch to a new sequence ( Restart and Dual conditions ) . These were analyzed with separate 2 x 2 x 2 ANOVAs on ER and RTs on correct trials ( Figure 2 ) . These analyses revealed a significant effects of cognitive control demands with main effects of Temporal Control in ER , but not RT ( ER: F ( 1 , 23 ) = 11 . 44 , p<0 . 005; RT: F ( 1 , 23 ) = 1 . 89 , p>0 . 15 ) , Contextual Control ( ER: F ( 1 , 23 ) = 20 . 00 , p<0 . 0005; RT: F ( 1 , 23 ) = 87 . 05 , p<10\u20138 ) , and their interaction ( ER: F ( 1 , 23 ) = 19 . 18 , p<0 . 0005; RT: F ( 1 , 23 ) = 10 . 24 , p<0 . 005 ) . Again , no effects of Stimulus Domain were observed ( ER and RT all p>0 . 05 ) . These analyses confirm the effective manipulation of cognitive control demands , but equivalent loadings of control demands across stimulus domain . To verify the\u00a0expected\u00a0rostral/caudal gradient by cognitive control in the LPFC , fMRI data from the epoch of the sub-tasks ( see Materials and methods for full modeling details ) were analyzed with a 2 x 2 x 2 ANOVA . Here , we focus on the effects of cognitive control ( Figure 3 ) , while the effects of Stimulus Domain are depicted in Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1 . The main effect of Temporal Control produced activations across the rostral-most aspects of the LPFC , mostly within the lateral frontopolar cortex ( FPl; putative area 10 ) and mid-middle frontal gyrus ( MFG; putative area 9/46 ) , also spanning orbitofrontal cortex and pars orbitalis ventrally , through rostral-MFG ( rMFG; putative area 46 ) laterally , up to the superior frontal gyrus dorsally . Previous studies have suggested that rostral LPFC is engaged as difficulty is increased regardless of functional demands ( Crittenden and Duncan , 2014; Fedorenko et al . , 2013 ) . Notably , the main effect of Temporal Control in the present design includes both the easiest condition ( Delay ) and hardest condition ( Dual ) . The rostral LPFC was engaged considering each condition in isolation ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2 ) , ruling out the possibility that activations in this area are attributable to difficulty . The main effect of Contextual Control was most pronounced in mid-lateral areas including the inferior frontal sulcus ( IFS; putative area 45 or 9/46v ) extending into pars triangularis ventrally , and the caudal middle frontal gyrus ( cMFG; putative area 8Ar or 9/46d ) dorsally . Significant effects extended both rostrally into the FPl , and caudally into the inferior frontal junction ( IFJ; putative area 44 or 8Av ) and pars opercularis ventrally , and the caudal superior frontal sulcus ( SFS; putative area 8Ad ) dorsally . Finally , the statistical interaction of the effects of cognitive control produced the strongest foci in caudal LPFC areas including the IFJ and pars opercularis ventrally , and the caudal SFS dorsally , spreading into the mid-lateral PFC . As indicated in Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3 , this interaction was primarily due to reduced activation during the Delay task , which had minimal demands on current processing . Thus , the effects are consistent with Feature Control . Collectively , these results demonstrate a rostral/caudal gradient as a function of cognitive control processes with an orderly progression of Temporal Control , Contextual Control , and Feature Control running from rostral to caudal spanning the entire LPFC ( Figure 3; Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 4 ) . These effects were replicable when the dataset was split into two , confirming their robustness ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 5 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 12112 . 006Figure 3 . Univariate whole-brain results . Temporal demands of cognitive control produced a gradient of activation along the rostral/caudal axis of the LPFC .

Despite being associated with the fastest reaction times and lowest error-rates , the Delay condition demonstrated activation in the rostral-most areas of the LPFC . These results indicate that the activations do not reflect difficulty , time-on-task , or attention . Conversely , the Dual condition demonstrated the slowest reactions times and highest error-rates , and produced convergent activations in the rostral-most areas of the LPFC . These results indicate that the activations do not reflect ease or 'default' activity .

Bars represent contrasts of each cognitive control condition against the Control condition , collapsing across Stimulus Domain . Data were split to provide unbiased estimates of activation ( see Materials and methods ) . Given the similar activation patterns between dorsal ( MFG , cMFG , SFS ) and ventral ( FPl , IFS , IFJ ) areas , data were averaged by rostral/caudal zone collapsing across the dorsal/ventral axis for statistical tests . *pcorrected<0 . 05; ***pcorrected<0 . 0005 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 12112 . 012 The previous analyses demonstrated the predicted rostral/caudal functional gradient as a function of cognitive control processes . Next , we sought to verify that this gradient reflected increasingly abstract processing in increasingly rostral areas . If processing in the LPFC becomes more abstract in progressively rostral areas , caudal areas should process concrete features such as stimulus-domain , whereas more rostral areas should instantiate control processes that act across domains ( e . g . a plan that can be applied to spatial or verbal stimuli ) . Thus , we reasoned that abstract versus concrete processing would reveal itself through stimulus domain-generality versus specificity . To test this hypothesis , we used activation peaks of the LPFC ROIs defined by the cognitive control contrasts above . Notably , each contrast produced a distinct dorsal and ventral activation peak spanning rostral areas ( FPl , MFG ) , mid areas ( IFS , cMFG ) , and caudal areas ( IFJ , SFS ) . Hence , this analysis enabled the examination of whether stimulus domain-sensitivity is present throughout the rostral/caudal axis , or whether domain-generality emerges at a particular rostra/caudal level . First , we performed a 2 ( dorsal , ventral ) x 3 ( rostral , mid , caudal ) ANOVA on the main effect of Stimulus Domain . This analysis revealed a significant effect of the dorsal/ventral axis ( F ( 1 , 23 ) = 100 . 21 , p<10\u20139 ) , a significant effect of the rostral/caudal axis ( F ( 2 , 46 ) = 10 . 63 , p<0 . 0005 ) , and critically , an interaction between the dorsal/ventral and rostral/caudal axes ( F ( 2 , 46 ) = 56 . 12 , p<10\u201312 ) . Follow-up t-tests revealed that caudal and mid ventral areas demonstrated verbal-sensitivity ( SFS: t ( 23 ) = 5 . 93 , pcorrected<0 . 0001; cMFG: t ( 23 ) = 5 . 08 , pcorrected<0 . 0005 ) , but not rostral areas ( MFG: t ( 23 ) = 1 . 54 , pcorrected>0 . 8 ) . Symmetrically , caudal and mid dorsal areas demonstrated spatial-sensitivity ( IFJ: t ( 23 ) = 7 . 83 , pcorrected<10\u20136; IFS: t ( 23 ) = 5 . 33 , pcorrected<0 . 0005 ) , but not rostral areas ( FPl: t ( 23 ) = \u22122 . 25 , pcorrected >0 . 2 ) . A similar lack of stimulus domain-sensitivity was observed in a third rostral peak ( rMFG: t ( 23 ) = 0 . 83 , p>0 . 4 ) . This region is not considered further due to lack of resting connectivity with the other LPFC regions ( see Materials and methods; Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 4 ) . Collectively , these data indicate caudal and mid LPFC are sensitive to stimulus domain , whereas rostral LPFC areas are domain-general , consistent with a gradient of abstraction ( Figure 4 ) . These effects were replicable when the dataset was split into two , confirming their robustness ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . Given the sensitivity of caudal areas to stimulus domain , and the close proximity of the peaks of effects of Stimulus Domain and Feature Control ( see Materials and methods; Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1 ) , we use the contrast of Stimulus Domain to define caudal areas in future analyses since they enable the most straight-forward separation of spatial and verbal aspects of Feature Control . 10 . 7554/eLife . 12112 . 013Figure 4 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 12112 . 014 Abstraction along the rostral/caudal axis of the LPFC is hypothesized to relate to the temporal control over action ( Fuster , 1997; Koechlin et al . , 2003; Koechlin and Summerfield , 2007 ) . By these ideas , concrete processing in caudal LPFC provides control over current processing ( e . g . translating stimuli to actions ) , while abstract processing in rostral LPFC organizes behavior according to future considerations ( e . g . goals or plans ) . To test this proposal , we examined the degree to which different rostral/caudal levels of the LPFC were related to current processing demands and future processing demands , as indexed by RT . Current demands were operationalized as RT during sub-task trials ( i . e . RTs corresponding directly to the epochs at which fMRI signal was measured ) . Future demands were operationalized as RT during return trials ( i . e . RTs corresponding to demands the trial after the fMRI signal was measured ) . Regressing these measures onto activation revealed a clear gradient such that caudal LPFC was related to current , but not future processing , while rostral LPFC was related to future , but not current processing , with mid LPFC showing activity related to both current and future processing ( Figure 5A ) . To quantify these relationships , we examined partial correlations with the ROIs described above . This revealed significant relationships between caudal LPFC and current ( r = 0 . 69 , pcorrected<10\u201322 ) , but not future processing ( r = 0 . 04 , p>0 . 5 ) . Conversely , rostral LPFC was related future ( r = 0 . 31 , pcorrected<0 . 0005 ) , but not current processing ( r = 0 . 06 , p>0 . 45 ) . Finally , activity in mid LPFC was related to both current ( r = 0 . 62 , pcorrected<10\u201317 ) and future processing ( r = 0 . 31 , pcorrected<0 . 0005; Figure 5B ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 12112 . 015Figure 5 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 12112 . 017 To bolster these findings , we regressed current and future RT on activations at each LPFC level in each subject . Then inferences on the resultant slope parameters were performed at the group-level ( i . e . summary-statistic approach ) . These parameters were submitted to a 3 x 2 ANOVA with factors of LPFC level ( caudal , mid , rostral ) and time ( current , future ) . This analysis revealed a significant LPFC level x time interaction ( F ( 2 , 46 ) = 30 . 85 , p<10\u20138; Figure 5C ) . T-tests on the individual parameter estimates corroborated the same pattern ( caudal-current: t ( 23 ) = 8 . 11 , pcorrected<10\u20136; caudal-future: t ( 23 ) = 0 . 80 , p>0 . 4; mid-current: t ( 23 ) = 7 . 21 , pcorrected<10\u20135; mid-future: t ( 23 ) = 3 . 14 , pcorrected<0 . 05; rostral-current: t ( 23 ) = \u22120 . 61 , p>0 . 5; rostral-future: t ( 23 ) = 3 . 60 , pcorrected<0 . 01 ) . Collectively , these data indicate a temporal abstraction gradient such that caudal LPFC areas reflect current processing demands , while rostral LPFC areas reflect future processing demands . Mid LPFC areas were related to both current and future demands , suggesting a potential zone for integrating rostral and caudal influences . These effects were replicable when the dataset was split into two , confirming their robustness ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . The above analyses demonstrate that the rostral/caudal LPFC axis is sensitive to abstraction with caudal areas showing concrete properties including stimulus domain-sensitivity and present-oriented processing , and rostral areas showing abstract properties including stimulus domain-generality and future-oriented processing . However , the question remains regarding how these areas interact to support goal-directed cognition and whether such interactions are hierarchical . Hierarchical interactions are presumed to be reflected by asymmetries in the influence of one region upon another ( Badre and D'Esposito , 2009 ) . Regions that are high in the hierarchy are thought to influence lower regions more than vice versa . Since directed influences cannot be inferred on the basis of correlations alone , we performed dynamic causal modeling ( DCM ) which describes directed influences between brain regions ( effective connectivity ) by estimating parameters in a series of differential equations ( Friston et al . , 2003 , see\u00a0Stephan et al . , 2010 for an accessible review ) . These differential equations include a forward model linking the hemodynamic response to underlying neural activity in order to describe how activity changes in a region as a function of inputs to that region . The ability of DCM to uncover underlying directed neuronal interactions has been validated using large-scale biophysical models ( Lee et al . , 2006 ) and invasive recordings in rodents ( David et al . , 2008 ) . However , since computational complexity precludes modeling all sources of inputs that drive changes in a particular region , DCM can only be applied to simplified neural circuits ( i . e . a small number of regions ) . Such simplifications also require including experimental manipulations such as stimulus delivery and experimental condition as direct drivers and modulators of activity . Despite these simplifications , DCM has been demonstrated to accurately identify the appropriate connections and modulations , even when the modeled regions are only a subset of the regions contributing to a process ( Lee et al . , 2006 ) . Finally , DCM leverages model comparison to determine the presence and strength of directed regional couplings . This requires specifying multiple ( plausible ) models and comparing model evidence to reveal which model provides the best account of the data . Hence , DCM can only make relative claims with respect to the explored model space . To examine interactions among LPFC sub-regions , we modeled the dynamics of activity in the six LPFC ROIs as a function of three sets of parameters: 1 ) inputs into the system from stimuli received by caudal areas; 2 ) connectivity among regions along which activity is propagated ( fixed connectivity ) ; and 3 ) changes in connectivity induced by demands of stimulus domain and cognitive control ( connectivity modulations ) . An example is schematized in Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1 . We then searched for asymmetries in the fixed connectivity and their modulations for evidence of hierarchical control . Group-level Bayesian model comparison adjudicated between models of effective connectivity within the LPFC ( Stephan et al . , 2009a ) ( see Methods for full details of the model procedure ) . Significant parameter estimates resulting from the best model are depicted in Figure 6 . We began by examining asymmetries in fixed connectivity ( Figure 6A ) . Fixed connectivity is constrained by structural connectivity ( Stephan et al . , 2009b ) , and thus provides a window into the relative strength of efferent and afferent connections . To evaluate whether fixed connections demonstrate hierarchical dependencies , we calculated the relative strength of efferent versus afferent connections with a simple contrast ( average efferent strength \u2013 average afferent strength ) based on estimated fixed connectivity of the model . Higher hierarchical areas would be expected to show a positive value on this metric . Similar explorations in the monkey have provided evidence for hierarchical structure , but with controversy surrounding whether the rostral LPFC is the apex of the hierarchy ( Badre and D'Esposito , 2009 ) or the mid LPFC ( Goulas et al . , 2014 ) . In our dataset , hierarchical strength increased monotonically from caudal areas to mid areas to MFG , but FPl demonstrated the lowest value on this metric resulting in an inverted-U pattern ( Figure 7 ) . These effects were replicable when the dataset was split into two , confirming their robustness ( Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . This pattern was not due to the average connectivity strength or total connectivity strength , which showed markedly different patterns ( Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2 ) , indicating that hierarchical strength is independent of the general magnitude of connectivity . 10 . 7554/eLife . 12112 . 018Figure 6 .

( A ) Average connectivity strength reflects the mean of rostral/caudal fixed connectivity for each region . ( B ) Total connectivity strength reflects the sum of rostral/caudal fixed connectivity . Both of these patterns were substantially different than the inverted-U pattern observed in hierarchical strength . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 12112 . 026 To better quantify the hierarchical organization of the LPFC , we fit a quadratic ( e . g . inverted-U ) function to each participants\u2019 hierarchical strength metrics . Here , the height of the vertex of the quadratic function estimates the hierarchical strength of the apex of the hierarchy , assuming it is positive . The position of the vertex provides an estimate of the rostral/caudal location of apex of the hierarchy . Across participants , the height of the vertex was significantly positive ( t ( 23 ) = 2 . 34 , p<0 . 05 ) , indicating that the vertex tended to represent the apex of the hierarchy . Furthermore , the vertex tended to be localized to the mid LPFC ( mean y-coordinate: 24 . 7 , standard error: 6 . 1 ) and differed significantly from both the rostral-most ( i . e . FPl; t ( 23 ) = -4 . 35 , p<0 . 0005 ) , and caudal-most ROIs ( i . e . SFS; t ( 23 ) = 4 . 18 , p<0 . 0005 ) . These results are inconsistent with a strict rostral-to-caudal hierarchy ( Badre and D'Esposito , 2009 ) and instead suggest that the apex of the LPFC hierarchy is in mid areas ( Goulas et al . , 2014 ) . Next , we searched for asymmetries in the modulations of effective connectivity by cognitive demands . Modulatory dynamics ( Figure 6B ) had the following properties: first , Stimulus Domain demands increased connectivity from caudal to mid LPFC areas ( hereafter , caudal-to-rostral modulations are referred to as 'bottom-up' ) . That is , when processing spatial stimuli , connectivity was increased from SFS to cMFG ( t ( 23 ) = 3 . 70 , q<0 . 005 ) , while processing verbal stimuli increased connectivity from IFJ to IFS ( t ( 23 ) = 3 . 89 , q<0 . 001 ) . Second , cognitive control demands modulated connectivity from rostral to mid LPFC areas ( hereafter , rostral-to-caudal modulations are referred to as 'top-down' ) . Temporal Control increased connectivity from FPl to MFG ( t ( 23 ) = 2 . 40 , q<0 . 05 ) . Contextual Control decreased connectivity from FPl to MFG ( t ( 23 ) = -5 . 45 , q<0 . 0001 ) , IFS ( t23 ) = -4 . 76 , q<0 . 0005 ) , and cMFG ( t ( 23 ) = -4 . 15 , q<0 . 001 ) , while increasing connectivity from MFG to IFS ( t ( 23 ) = 8 . 18 , q<10\u20136 ) and cMFG ( t ( 23 ) = 7 . 70 , q<10\u20136 ) . Collectively , these data indicate that demands on stimulus domain influence bottom-up processing , while demands on cognitive control influence top-down processing . These results suggest that demands on cognitive control result in a convergence of influences at the mid LPFC where top-down and bottom-up information meet . These effects were replicable when the dataset was split into two , confirming their robustness ( Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . Hierarchical processing is important due to high degree of flexibility and computational efficiency it confers ( Botvinick and Weinstein , 2014; Duncan , 2013; Solway et al . , 2014 ) . Therefore , we predicted that the modeled LPFC hierarchical interactions should be related to cognitive abilities . To explore this possibility , we examined the relationship between the modeled estimates of effective connectivity and trait-measured higher-level cognitive ability . First , we observed that individual differences in the magnitude of top-down modulations by cognitive control ( as measured by estimates of modulations of effective connectivity; Figure 6B ) tended to be inter-related ( Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1A ) . This suggests that top-down control is an individual difference metric . Using principle components analysis , we distilled the cognitive control-induced changes in top-down effective connectivity into a single factor ( Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . Similarly , we combined the stimulus domain-induced changes in bottom-up effective connectivity into a single factor . We found that these measures were inversely related , such that individuals that tended to have strong top-down influences tended to have weaker bottom-up influences and vice versa ( r = \u22120 . 52 , p<0 . 01; robust regression t ( 22 ) = \u22122 . 79 , p<0 . 05; Figure 8A ) . This was not due to the model fitting procedure as the model covariance matrix indicated a negligible relationship between these factors ( Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1B ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 12112 . 027Figure 8 . LPFC dynamics and higher-level cognitive ability . Neural metrics were based on modeled estimates of effective connectivity and their modulations ( Figure 6 ) .

( C ) By contrast , bottom-up strength did not correlate with higher-level cognitive capacity .

This metric was also positively related to higher-level cognitive capacity . *p<0 . 05; **p<0 . 005 .

Data were split into two data sets through an alternating runs procedure . Details are otherwise identical to Figure 8 in the main text . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 12112 . 030 Next , we examined several independent measures of higher-level cognitive ability which included tests of working memory and fluid intelligence . Performance on these measures tended to be inter-correlated ( Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1C ) , so we combined them into a single factor using principle components analysis . We examined the relationship between model-derived metrics of top-down and bottom-up processing , and trait-measured higher-level cognitive ability . While there was no relationship between bottom-up processing and higher-level cognitive ability ( r = \u22120 . 01 , p>0 . 95; robust regression t ( 22 ) = 0 . 09 , p>0 . 9; Figure 8C ) , there was a significant positive relationship between top-down processing and higher-level cognitive ability ( r = 0 . 47 , p<0 . 05; robust regression t ( 22 ) = 2 . 25 , p<0 . 05; Figure 8B ) . This relationship remained after removing 2 participants with higher-level cognitive abilities greater than 2 standard deviations below the mean ( r = 0 . 43 , p<0 . 05; robust regression t ( 20 ) = 2 . 21 , p<0 . 05 ) . Hence , those individuals with greater top-down processing demonstrate greater higher-level cognitive ability . Subsequently , we explored the relationship between the hierarchical strength of the modeled fixed connectivity and trait-measured higher-level cognitive ability . In particular , we were interested in whether the degree to which mid LPFC demonstrated hierarchically organized fixed connectivity predicted higher-level cognitive ability . We related the height of the vertex fit described above \u2013 summarizing the hierarchical strength of mid LPFC \u2013 to trait-measured higher-level cognitive ability . This relationship was significantly positive ( r = 0 . 61 , p<0 . 005; robust regression t ( 22 ) = 4 . 68 , p=0 . 0001; Figure 8D ) indicating that those individuals with stronger mid LPFC hierarchical fixed connectivity demonstrate greater higher-level cognitive ability . This relationship largely remained after removing 2 participants with higher-level cognitive abilities greater than 2 standard deviations below the mean ( r = 0 . 39 , p=0 . 07; robust regression t ( 20 ) = 3 . 00 , p<0 . 01 ) . Furthermore , this relationship remained after controlling for contributions of average connectivity of mid LPFC ( cMFG , IFS , and MFG ) , and global connectivity of the LPFC ( \u03c1 = 0 . 47 , p<0 . 05; robust regression t ( 20 ) = 2 . 66 , p<0 . 05 ) , indicating that hierarchical connectivity makes important contributions to higher-level cognitive ability over-and-above simple connectivity magnitude . This suggests that the hierarchical strength of the mid LPFC is beneficial to higher-level cognition . The height of the vertex summarizes the hierarchical strength of mid LPFC . However , it is obtained by fitting the hierarchical strengths of all areas , thereby incorporating some information from other regions , as well . One might be interested in the degree to which the relationship between higher-level cognitive ability and hierarchical strength is selective to mid LPFC . This is difficult to disentangle due to the fact that hierarchical strengths of different regions are interdependent . Nevertheless , a simple average of the mid LPFC hierarchical strength ( including cMFG , IFS , and MFG ) produced similar results to the height of the vertex method described above ( r = 0 . 48 , p<0 . 05; robust regression t ( 22 ) = 2 . 38 , p<0 . 05 ) . Opposite results were obtained by relating higher-level cognitive ability to the hierarchical strength of caudal LPFC ( r = \u22120 . 43 , p<0 . 05; robust regression t ( 22 ) = \u22122 . 00 , p=0 . 057 ) and FPl ( r = \u22120 . 42 , p<0 . 05; robust regression t ( 22 ) = \u22122 . 41 , p<0 . 05 ) , which is to be expected given the strong interdependencies between the hierarchical strength of mid LPFC to both caudal and rostral LPFC ( mid to caudal , r = \u22120 . 84 , p<10\u20136; mid to FPl , r = \u22120 . 87 , p<10\u20137 ) . Partial correlations were unable to convincingly determine whether the relationships between higher-level cognitive ability and hierarchical strength were primarily due to the hierarchical strength of mid LPFC or other areas ( \u03c1mid\u00b7caudal = 0 . 27 , p>0 . 2; \u03c1mid\u00b7FPl = 0 . 29 , p>0 . 15; \u03c1caudal\u00b7mid = \u22120 . 03 , p>0 . 85; \u03c1FPl\u00b7mid = 0 . 03 , p>0 . 85 ) . However , that the relationships between caudal/rostral LPFC and higher-level cognitive ability were negligible after partialing out the contributions of mid LPFC and that the reverse was not true is suggestive that the main driver is the hierarchical strength of the mid LPFC . Finally , we assessed the unique contribution of each LPFC dynamic factor described above to higher-level cognitive ability . The strength of top-down modulations by cognitive control , bottom-up modulations by stimulus domain , and hierarchical fixed connectivity of the mid LPFC were simultaneously regressed on trait-measured higher-level cognitive ability . This analysis revealed significant effects of top-down modulations ( ordinary least-squares regression t ( 20 ) = 2 . 45 , p<0 . 05; robust regression t ( 20 ) = 2 . 21 , p<0 . 05 ) , and mid LPFC hierarchical fixed connectivity ( ordinary least-squares regression t ( 20 ) = 3 . 13 , p<0 . 01; robust regression t ( 20 ) = 3 . 58 , p<0 . 005 ) , but no effect of bottom-up modulations ( ordinary least-squares regression t ( 20 ) = 1 . 81 , p>0 . 05; robust regression t ( 20 ) = 1 . 48 , p>0 . 15 ) . These results indicate that both the hierarchical orientation of the mid LPFC at baseline , and the top-down modulation from rostral LPFC to mid LPFC during cognitive control make separable and positive contributions to higher-level cognitive ability . \n We examined interactions within the LPFC by varying demands on stimulus domain and cognitive control . Collectively , these demands engaged most of LPFC providing the opportunity for a comprehensive account of its function . We found that progressively rostral areas processed progressively abstract levels of cognitive control with demands on Feature Control , Contextual Control , and Temporal Control eliciting increasingly rostral activations . Moreover , stimulus domain-sensitivity was present in caudal and mid LPFC , but not in rostral LPFC consistent with abstract processing in rostral areas . Correlations between neural activation and behavioral performance revealed that caudal LPFC varied linearly with demands on current processing , while rostral LPFC varied linearly with demands on future processing . Both relationships were present in the mid LPFC , indicating a potential zone where current and future processing converges . Dynamic causal modeling revealed that hierarchical asymmetries in connectivity were strongest in mid LPFC . Furthermore , cognitive demands elicited both top-down influences from rostral to mid LPFC and bottom-up influences from caudal to mid LPFC . Thus , analyses of effective connectivity and its modulations suggest that mid LPFC forms a nexus where information converges to influence action . Finally , both the hierarchical orientation of the mid LPFC in fixed connectivity , and the top-down influences from rostral LPFC to mid LPFC during the engagement of cognitive control were positively related to higher-level cognitive ability . Hence , the functional organization of the LPFC is intimately tied to cognitive capacity . A matter of debate is whether or not processing in the LPFC is hierarchical . From a computational perspective , hierarchical processing is advantageous ( Botvinick and Weinstein , 2014; Solway et al . , 2014 ) , although relating such processing advantages to the LPFC has been challenging . Badre and D\u2019Esposito ( Badre and D'Esposito , 2009 ) suggested that the hallmark of hierarchies is asymmetrical influence . That is , those components that are higher in the hierarchy influence lower components more than vice versa . Based on patterns of efferent and afferent projections , they proposed a rostral-to-caudal hierarchy such that rostral areas are higher than caudal areas . Recently , however , the evidence for a rostral-to-caudal hierarchy based on asymmetry of anatomical projections has been called into question . Based on a meta-analysis of projections among areas of the LPFC in monkeys , hierarchy was determined by the asymmetry with which a given area sent projections to other areas compared to the converse ( Goulas et al . , 2014 ) . The results did not support the notion that rostral LPFC ( frontopolar cortex , putative area 10 ) is the top of the hierarchy . Instead , mid LPFC areas ( putative areas 45 and 46 ) tended to be at the highest hierarchical levels , while area 10 was low in the hierarchy . However , homologies between human and monkey LPFC are still uncertain and there are marked differences between human and monkey frontopolar cortex ( Semendeferi et al . , 2001; Neubert et al . , 2014 ) . Nevertheless , our results examining fixed connectivity , a putative correlate of structural connections , are consistent with the findings that mid LPFC is higher and rostral LPFC is lower in the LPFC hierarchy . Collectively , these data suggest that mid LPFC forms the apex of the frontal hierarchy as measured by asymmetrical connectivity . Other support for a rostral-to-caudal LPFC hierarchy comes from observed changes in functional connectivity by cognitive demands . In a landmark study , Koechlin et al ( Koechlin et al . , 2003 ) demonstrated a cascade of activations across LPFC such that the more temporally remote the control process , the more rostral the activation . Moreover , structural equation modeling revealed significant effective connectivity from rostral to caudal areas as a function of cognitive demands , consistent with a rostral-to-caudal hierarchy . While compelling , rostral-to-caudal models were not compared to other organizational schemes . Since a different organization may have produced superior fits to the data , it is difficult to draw conclusions from these connectivity data . In the present dataset , a strictly rostral-to-caudal model of modulations produced significant top-down modulatory effects consistent with Koechlin et al ( Koechlin et al . , 2003 ) . However , this model produced a substantially worse fit to the data than the model we describe ( see Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3 ) , rendering rostral-to-caudal dynamics doubtful . In the present data , we performed explicit model comparison and examined effective connectivity as the LPFC was engaged by a variety of cognitive demands . We found that influences as a function of cognitive demands did not follow a strict rostral-to-caudal progression . While cognitive control demands did modulate influences from rostral to mid areas , stimulus domain demands modulated influences from caudal to mid areas . This pattern of connectivity is consistent with the notion that mid areas are an integration zone where domain-general top-down influences and domain-specific bottom-up influences converge . This is corroborated by the activation-behavior relationships which demonstrated that whereas rostral and caudal areas were related to future and current processing , respectively , mid areas were related to both . This suggests that mid LPFC simultaneously represents information from both rostral and caudal areas . From a developmental perspective , it is interesting to note that mid LPFC areas develop later than caudal and rostral LPFC areas ( Shaw et al . , 2008; Gogtay et al . , 2004 ) . As a general pattern , integrative areas tend to develop later than the areas over which they integrate ( Gogtay et al . , 2004 ) . Thus , the maturation of mid LPFC areas may be influenced by simultaneous top-down and bottom-up demands ( Badre and D'Esposito , 2009 ) preparing the mid LPFC for an integrative role . These ideas are bolstered by evidence that the mid LPFC is a cortical hub with high global connectivity , the degree of which predicts intelligence ( Cole et al . , 2012 ) . If mid LPFC is a convergence zone where top-down influences from rostral LPFC and bottom-up influences from caudal LPFC meet , it could serve to integrate abstract goals or intentions from rostral areas and concrete contextual information from caudal areas in order to guide action selection . Perhaps the strongest data to date for rostral/caudal LPFC asymmetries comes from lesion studies . Badre et al ( Badre et al . , 2009 ) manipulated the level of cognitive control while testing patients with focal lesions to different LPFC regions . They found that those patients that had damage to mid LPFC demonstrated impaired performance at higher levels of the task , but not lower levels , while patients that had damage to a caudal LPFC demonstrated impaired performance on both higher and lower levels of the task . These results were recently replicated and extended with a different task whereby similar asymmetries were observed across three levels: caudal , mid , and rostral LPFC ( Azuar et al . , 2014 ) . Collectively , these studies suggest a rostral/caudal hierarchy wherein higher level controllers depend upon intact lower level controllers , but not vice versa . Both the model of the present data ( Figure 6 ) and the lesion studies are consistent with the proposal that operations of the mid LPFC depend upon caudal LPFC , but not vice versa . As depicted in the model , this is due to bottom-up , but not top-down , modulations from caudal LPFC to mid LPFC as a function of cognitive demand . Of note is that mid LPFC lesions in the studies of Badre et al ( Badre et al . , 2009 ) and Azuar et al ( Azuar et al . , 2014 ) appeared to include the area we refer to as MFG ( putative area 9/46 ) . In our model , MFG processes sub-task cues , consistent with its role in rule processing ( Nee and Brown , 2012; Bunge et al . , 2005; Genovesio et al . , 2005; Wallis et al . , 2001 ) . Given that all of the cognitive control demands require processing the sub-task cues , lesions to MFG would affect all of the cognitive control sub-tasks . In this way , operations of FPl are dependent on an intact MFG . Furthermore , in the model , modulations from FPl onto mid LPFC are inhibitory in nature , counteracting the baseline positive influence observed in the fixed connectivity . Thus , the cancellation of negative and positive influences could lead to a negligible impact of FPl lesions on mid LPFC processing . Collectively then , our model indicates that a similar rostral/caudal cascade of asymmetric impairments could be observed with the present task dynamics . Furthermore , our data highlight the need for task-based modeling of neural dynamics in the intact brain to unravel the mechanisms that can lead to lesion-based deficits . The parameters estimated in our model indicated both positive ( i . e . excitatory ) and negative ( i . e . inhibitory ) modulations of effective connectivity . Interestingly , all inhibitory modulations arose from FPl as a function of Contextual Control demands . That is , Contextual Control reduced the influence of this region upon more caudal areas . This is in contrast to the excitatory modulation from FPl to MFG observed during Temporal Control demands . While Temporal Control required preserving past information in order to integrate it into future processing , Contextual Control required the isolation of current processing from previous and future processing . Our data suggest that the dynamics of FPl reflect these two forms of processing . That is , excitatory influence from FPl promotes integrative processing , while inhibitory influence from FPl promotes segregated processing . Such inhibitory influences during Contextual\u00a0Control may have been necessary to overcome the positive fixed connectivity observed between FPl and other regions . Hence , although FPl was active for both Temporal Control and Contextual Control , this activity promoted different forms of processing under different conditions , realized by dynamic interactions between FPl and other areas of the LPFC . Our data highlight that directions of influence are dynamic rather than static . That is , whereas fixed connectivity demonstrated asymmetrically greater influence from mid LPFC to other regions , various task demands modulated connectivity towards , but not from , the mid LPFC . This suggests that asymmetries in the LPFC shift according to task demands . Recent work has demonstrated that the LPFC flexibly adapts its connectivity as a function of task demands ( Cole et al . , 2013 ) , suggesting that dynamics in the LPFC may be of central importance for cognitive control . Whether and how such dynamics support hierarchical processing is a critical matter for future research . Connectivity modulations that did follow a rostral-to-caudal direction of influence positively predicted independent measures of higher-level cognitive ability . However , modulations in the opposite direction demonstrated no such relationship . While it has been well-documented that top-down influences from the LPFC to posterior areas of cortex are important for working memory , sustained attention , mitigating distraction , and a variety of other cognitive abilities ( D'Esposito and Postle , 2015; Gazzaley and Nobre , 2012 ) , the relationship between top-down control within the LPFC and such higher-level cognitive processes has been less well studied . Our data suggest that top-down control within the LPFC is an important determinant of higher-level cognitive function . Furthermore , we found that more strongly asymmetrical hierarchical projections from mid LPFC to other LPFC regions were related to better higher-level cognitive ability . This suggests a beneficial cognitive effect of a hierarchical organization with mid LPFC at the apex . The term 'hierarchy' is typically used to describe dominance relationships . Accordingly , we have attempted to operationalize such dominance relationships by reasoning that greater outward relative to inward connectivity reflects larger influence of one region over another . Such rationale has been used previously ( Badre and D'Esposito , 2009; Goulas et al . , 2014 ) . However , different definitions of hierarchy may lead to different assignments of rank among the LPFC . For example , hierarchy may be defined by temporal control , with higher levels organizing behavior over broader timescales ( Koechlin et al . , 1999; 2003 ) . Alternatively , hierarchy could be defined by modulations of influence as a result of cognitive demands . Such relationships are typified by the top-down biasing that LPFC exerts over posterior areas during difficult selections ( Miller and Cohen , 2001 ) . These various definitions lead to different rank orderings in our data . However , regardless of definition , the mid LPFC appeared to play a central role in our data showing the greatest outward relative to inward asymmetry , containing both future and present oriented signals that related to behavior , and providing a convergence zone of modulatory inputs . Hence , these data make it clear that the mid LPFC is a critical nexus for cognitive control . How to operationally define the rostral/caudal axis of the LPFC has been a matter of considerable debate . Gradients of activation along the rostral/caudal axis of the LPFC have been observed by manipulating the temporal timescale of control processing and relational complexity ( see\u00a0Badre , 2008 for an in-depth review ) . However , activations spanning the rostral/caudal axis of the LPFC can be observed by tasks that do not clearly manipulate these processes ( Crittenden and Duncan , 2014 ) , and manipulations of these processes do not always lead to orderly gradients of activation ( Reynolds et al . , 2012 ) . The purpose of the present study was not to resolve these issues ( but see\u00a0Nee et al . , 2014 for a recent attempt ) . However , our results are most consistent with the idea that the LPFC is temporally organized ( Koechlin et al . , 2003; Koechlin and Summerfield , 2007; Fuster , 2001 ) . In these data , caudal LPFC was involved in current processing , providing selective attention to visual stimulus features , while rostral LPFC was involved in future processing , enabling the retention of information for integration into future processing . The mid LPFC appeared to synthesize both current and future processing allowing the use of current and future informed contextual information to organize behavior . Hence , the temporal timescale of processing/representation increased from caudal to rostral areas . A rostral-to-caudal hierarchy makes intuitive sense from the perspective of the temporal control of action . Long-lasting abstract representations such as goals or plans are thought to influence concrete representations such as actions . Mid-level representations such as contexts are in-between , governing the correct action tendencies given the prevailing situation . By a rostral-to-caudal hierarchy then , goals should govern contexts . However , it is often the case that contexts dictate whether a goal is achievable or not ( e . g . a social situation is not a good context within which to write a manuscript ) . In such cases , the context may suggest a new goal to pursue ( e . g . network instead of write ) . Hence , the ideal controller may take into account longer-term objectives and the current situation in order to arrive at the correct behavior for the moment . Our data indicate that the mid LPFC has the connectivity properties of such a controller , thereby forming a central nexus for cognitive control . \n We report results from 24 ( 13 female ) right-handed native English speakers ( mean age 19 . 9 years , range 18\u201328 ) . The targeted number of participants was based upon previous work indicating that sample sizes in the 20\u201325 range are appropriate to achieve reliable fMRI results ( Thirion et al . , 2007 ) and within the range of previous relevant literature ( Badre and D'Esposito , 2007; Nee and Brown , 2012; 2013; Bahlmann et al . , 2015; Nee et al . , 2014; Jeon and Friederici , 2013 ) . Informed consent was obtained in accordance with the Committee for Protection of Human Subjects at the University of California , Berkeley . Data from only the first session are reported for one participant since that they were unable to complete the second fMRI session due to technical issues . The task design was a factorial 2 x 2 x 2 , with factors of Stimulus Domain ( verbal , spatial ) , Contextual Control ( high , low ) , and Temporal Control ( high , low; Figure 1 ) . 'Contextual Control' in the present paradigm was originally referred to as 'dual-tasking' ( Koechlin et al . , 1999 ) . Later ( Charron and Koechlin , 2010 ) , it was recognized that the dual-tasking component applies most aptly to the condition we refer to as 'Dual' ( also referred to as 'Branching' [Koechlin et al . , 1999; Charron and Koechlin , 2010] ) . 'Switching' was the term applied in more recent work ( Charron and Koechlin , 2010 ) . However , the examined process is likely to be akin to preparing to switch rather than switching itself . The process by which a contextual cue determines the appropriate rule set has previously been referred to as 'Contextual Control' ( Koechlin et al . , 2003; Koechlin and Summerfield , 2007 ) , which we feel accurately describes the process . 'Temporal control' in the present paradigm was originally referred to as 'working memory' ( Koechlin et al . , 1999 ) . Di Pisapia et al ( De Pisapia et al . , 2007 ) have demonstrated that relative to simple maintenance , to which working memory is often associated , maintenance for future integration specifically engages rostral LPFC . It is this process that is of primary interest here . In Koechlin\u2019s framework ( Koechlin et al . , 2003; Koechlin and Summerfield , 2007 ) , the process has partial overlap with both 'episodic control' and 'branching control' , both of which are distinguished from other forms of control by their temporal nature . Here , we use the term 'temporal control' which we believe most generally reflects the process . On each trial , a letter was presented at one of five spatial locations ( i . e . points of a star ) surrounded by a colored frame . The color informed participants whether letters or locations were relevant for the block of 7 to 13 trials . Color-to-stimulus domain mappings were counterbalanced across participants . In the basic tasks , participants determined if the current stimulus followed the preceding stimulus in a sequence ( Figure 1C ) . In the first trial of any block , participants decided whether the stimulus was the first item in the sequence ( i . e . \u2018t\u2019 if the verbal task , the top point of the star if the spatial task ) . Thereafter , responses depended upon whether the current stimulus followed the preceding stimulus in the sequence . Participants responded either affirmatively or negatively on each trial via keypress using their index fingers with response mappings counter-balanced across participants . Square frames cued the basic task and all trials of the Control condition . Triangle , cross , and circle frames indicated sub-tasks with cue-to-sub-task mappings counterbalanced across participants . All blocks began with 2 to 5 trials of the basic task . Then , either the basic task continued ( Control ) , or one of three sub-tasks were denoted by a cue change . In the Restart condition , participants determined whether the stimulus was the start of the sequence , thus starting the sequence anew . When the cue reverted to a square , participants once again started a new sequence . In the Delay condition , participants ignored all cued stimuli by responding negatively , and resumed the basic task when the cue reverted , evaluating whether the current stimulus sequentially followed the stimulus prior to the cue change . Finally , the Dual condition combined both the Restart and Delay conditions . Participants were cued to begin a new sequence , while also retaining in memory the item prior to the cue change . Each sub-task lasted 3 to 5 trials . Following each sub-task , participants performed a return trial , then 1 to 2 trials of the basic task . Participants completed 24 blocks of each cell of the 2 x 2 x 2 design over the course of 2 fMRI sessions . A total of 1920 trials were performed , including 96 for each sub-task . Sessions were split into 6 runs of 16 blocks ( 160 trials ) each . The experiment length was chosen to match previous research with a related design ( Charron and Koechlin , 2010 ) . Within a week prior to scanning , participants performed a practice session to learn the task . During the practice session , participants performed the task under experimenter supervision until they were comfortable with the instructions . Thereafter , they completed 3 runs of the task on their own . Furthermore , participants performed a single practice run in the scanner during each session , just prior to functional data collection . To obtain independent assessments of higher-level cognitive ability , we collected simple and complex measures of verbal and spatial working memory , as well as fluid intelligence . Complex span was tested using automated measures of verbal working memory ( operation span ) and spatial working memory ( symmetry span ) , which have been previously described ( Turner and Engle , 1989 ) . Tests of simple working memory included letter span ( verbal ) and spatial span ( spatial ) . These tests were also automated and made identical to the memory portions of the operation span and symmetry span tasks , respectively . Fluid intelligence was measured using Raven\u2019s Advanced Progressive Matrices . These measures were collected for the purpose of providing correlates for different aspects LPFC function . However , given the high correlations between these measures ( Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1C ) , the measures were difficult to factorize into dissociable components . As a result , the measures were combined into a single factor reflecting general higher-level cognitive ability using principle components analysis . Images were acquired on a Siemens TIM/Trio 3T MRI equipped with a 32-channel head coil located in the Henry H . Wheeler , Jr . Brain Imaging Center at the University of California , Berkeley . Stimuli were presented to the participant via a coil attached mirror reflecting a projector situated at the bore of the magnet . Experimental tasks were presented using E-Prime software version 2 . 0 ( Psychology Software Tools , Inc . , Pittsburgh , PA ) . Eye tracking was performed using an Avotec system ( http://www . avotecinc . com/ ) and Viewpoint software ( http://www . arringtonresearch . com/ ) . Eye position was also monitored by the experimenter during the course of the session for saccades and vigilance , largely to confirm that participants did not use gaze location to assist spatial memory . Since experimenter monitoring confirmed that participants maintained central fixation and vigilance , eye movement data were not further analyzed . Response data were collected on an MR-compatible button box . Functional T2*-weighted images were acquired using an EPI sequence with 35 descending slices and 3 . 44 x 3 . 44 x 3 . 75 mm3 voxels ( TR = 2000 ms; echo time = 25 ms; flip angle = 70; field of view = 220 ) . Three dummy acquisitions preceded each functional scan to allow for image stabilization . Phase and magnitude images were collected to estimate the magnetic inhomogeneity . High-resolution T1-weighted MPRAGE images were collected for spatial normalization ( 240 x 256 x 160 matrix of 1 mm3 isotropic voxels; TR = 2300 ms; echo time = 2 . 98 ms; flip angle = 9 ) . A 6-min eyes open resting state scan was collected in each session in addition to the task scans . The resting state scan was collected prior to the task in the first session and after the task in the second session . Imaging data can be made available upon request . Unless otherwise specified , preprocessing was performed using SPM8 ( http://www . fil . ion . ucl . ac . uk/spm/ ) . Images were converted from DICOM into nifti format . Origins for all images were manually set to the anterior commissure . Functional data were spike-corrected to reduce the impact of artifacts using AFNI\u2019s 3dDespike routine ( http://afni . nimh . nih . gov/afni ) . Functional images were corrected for differences in slice timing using sinc-interpolation and head movement using a least-squares approach and a 6 parameter rigid body spatial transformation . Images were corrected for distortion and movement-by-susceptibility artifacts using the FieldMap toolbox ( Andersson et al . , 2001 ) . Structural data were coregistered to the functional data and segmented into gray and white-matter probability maps ( Ashburner and Friston , 1997 ) . These segmented images were used to calculate spatial normalization parameters to the MNI template , which were subsequently applied to the functional data . As part of spatial normalization , the data were resampled to 2 x 2 x 2 mm3 . 8-mm full-width/half-maximum isotropic Gaussian smoothing was applied to all functional images . All analyses included a temporal high-pass filter ( 128\u00a0s ) , correction for temporal autocorrelation using an autoregressive AR ( 1 ) model , and each image was run-wise scaled to have a global mean intensity of 100 . Analyses were performed using SPM8 . Subject-level models were fit with a general linear model including epoch regressors for the Control , Restart , Delay , and Dual conditions crossed with two Stimulus Domain types . These regressors spanned the onset of the second trial of the sub-task through the last trial of the sub-task . Since the Control condition did not contain an overt sub-task , epochs in the middle of the block were modeled to match the other conditions . Separate impulse regressors were included for the first trial of each block , the first trial of each sub-task , return trials , pre-sub-task trials , and post-sub-task trials , all crossed with Stimulus Domain . Additional nuisance impulse regressors separately coded for left and right motor responses , and error responses . All of the above regressors were convolved with a canonical hemodynamic response function . For participants demonstrating greater than 3mm/degrees of motion over the course of the session or a single movement of greater than 0 . 5mm/degrees in-between TRs , 24 motion regressors were included reflecting total displacement , squared total displacement , differential ( TR-to-TR ) displacement , and squared differential displacement to capture signal artifacts related to motion ( Lund et al . , 2005; Satterthwaite et al . , 2013 ) . Eight parameters of interest ( Control , Restart , Delay , Dual conditions each with two Stimulus Domain types ) were carried forward to a group-level model . This model was estimated as a 2 x 2 x 2 ANOVA with factors of Stimulus Domain ( verbal , spatial ) , Contextual Control ( high , low ) , and Temporal Control ( high , low ) . All main effects and interactions were conducted as t-tests within the ANOVA framework . Main effects of Stimulus Domain were explored in both directions ( i . e . verbal > spatial , and spatial > verbal ) . A p<0 . 001 height and 124 voxel extent threshold provided family-wise error correction at p<0 . 05 according to the AlphaSim routine in AFNI . To determine the robustness of the whole-brain results , we split the dataset in two using an alternating runs approach . For each participant , odd runs were placed in one dataset and even runs in another , counterbalanced across participants . One participant who completed only one fMRI session was excluded from this analysis . Whole-brain analyses were estimated for each dataset as described above . These results can be visualized in Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 5 . To provide unbiased estimates for statistical tests and visualization , regions-of-interest ( ROIs ) were defined in one dataset and tested in the other . To test stimulus domain-sensitivity of regions involved in cognitive control along the rostral/caudal axis , ROIs were placed at activation peaks in the LPFC defined by the main effects of Temporal Control , Contextual Control , and their interaction relating to Feature Control . Areas of interest were first determined based on the entire dataset , then analogous peaks were localized in each dataset half . Distinct peaks were defined as those at least 1 . 5 cm from another peak , starting with the Temporal Control contrast , followed by the Feature Control contrast , followed by the Contextual Control contrast , proceeding from the most significant to least significant peak . Different orderings of these definitions produced similar results . Given that the preponderance of activations were left lateralized , consistent with previous reports ( Badre and D'Esposito , 2007; Nee and Brown , 2012; 2013; Bahlmann et al . , 2014; 2015; Nee et al . , 2014; Jeon and Friederici , 2013; Jeon et al . , 2014 ) , we focused on the left hemisphere . With these procedures , the following areas were defined: FPl ( -44 48 4 \u2013 whole; -32 58 12 \u2013 set 1; -34 54 8 \u2013 set 2 ) , rMFG ( -28 56 22 whole; -28 56 22 set 1; -28 48 26 set 2 ) , MFG ( -38 28 44 \u2013 whole; -38 28 44 \u2013 set 1; -38 28 46 \u2013 set 2 ) , IFS ( -52 20 28 \u2013 whole; -42 34 16 \u2013 set 1; -44 20 28 \u2013 set 2 ) , cMFG ( -34 10 60 \u2013 whole; -30 12 60 \u2013 set 1; -24 6 52 \u2013 set 2 ) , IFJ ( -40 10 20 \u2013 whole; -38 10 24 \u2013 set 1; -36 6 34 \u2013 set 2 ) , SFS ( -24 4 54 \u2013 whole; -24 4 52 \u2013 set 1; -24 4 50 \u2013 set 2 ) . For IFS , a right , but not left hemisphere peak was identified in set 1 , so a corresponding left hemisphere peak was defined by flipping the sign of the x-coordinate . A 6\u00a0mm sphere was created around each peak and spatially-averaged parameter estimates were extracted from each ROI . Due to its lack of connectivity with the rest of the LPFC ( described in more detail below; Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 4 ) , we describe results in rMFG in the text , but exclude it from the main visualizations and analyses for the sake of expedience . We note that its inclusion does not alter the results or conclusions . Relationships between activation and RT were analyzed to assess the role of different areas of the LPFC in cognitive performance . Mean RT for the 8 conditions of interest were calculated for each subject , then z-scored within-subject to produce normalized measures ( note that the fMRI data are also scaled prior to parameter estimation ) . This procedure was done separately for the sub-task trials and the return trials . We refer to RT from sub-task trials as 'Current RT' since these RTs correspond to the epoch at which the fMRI contrasts are measured . We refer to RT from return trials as 'Future RT' since these RTs correspond to the trial following the epoch at which the fMRI contrasts are measured . Relationships between activation and behavior were assessed in four ways . First , Current and Future RT were regressed onto activation on a voxel-wise basis after regressing out subject-specific effects using a dummy variable approach . Significance was assessed for each relationship with a p<0 . 001 height and 124 voxel extent threshold providing family-wise error correction at p<0 . 05 according to AlphaSim . Voxels were then labeled as those showing a significant relationship to Current , but not Future RT , Future , but not Current RT , and both . Subsequent tests were performed within ROIs . We defined rostral LPFC by pooling activations in FPl and MFG , mid LPFC by pooling IFS and cMFG , and caudal LPFC by pooling IFJ and SFS . Areas were defined based upon peaks of the entire dataset described above with the exception that caudal areas were defined based on the main effect of Stimulus Domain , which produced ROIs slightly more distanced from the mid LPFC ( SFS: -22 0 54; IFJ: -38 6 26 ) . These caudal ROIs were used for all subsequent analyses . Second , partial correlations between activation and Current RT ( controlling for Future RT ) , and activation and Future RT ( controlling for Current RT ) were calculated after regressing out subject-specific effects using a dummy variable approach . The above two analyses were used for visualization since they produce the most straightforward means to depict the observed relationships . However , to better statistically control for subject-specific effects , we used a summary statistic approach by regressing Current and Future RTs on activations separately for each LPFC zone in each subject and then performing statistics on the corresponding regression slopes . We also performed a linear mixed effects approach that is not described due to redundancy . All four approaches yielded consistent results . All ROI-based tests were Bonferroni corrected for multiple comparisons . Preprocessing was identical to the task-based data described above through co-registration . Linear , squared , differential , and squared differential motion parameters were used as nuisance regressors ( Satterthwaite et al . , 2013 ) . The functional data and nuisance regressors were high-pass filtered at 0 . 009\u2009Hz . Thereafter , signal from white matter and ventricles were extracted and added as additional nuisance regressors . After regressing out the nuisance regressors , the data were low pass filtered at 0 . 08\u2009Hz . Finally , the data were spatially normalized and smoothed with an 8-mm Gaussian kernel . To examine interactions among LPFC sub-regions as a function of cognitive demands , we used dynamic causal modeling ( DCM ) ( Friston et al . , 2003 ) . DCM is a model-based method for inferring the directed influences among regions , and how these influences are modulated by cognitive demands see ( Stephan et al . , 2010 ) for an accessible review . DCM consists of two main components: a hemodynamic forward model which describes the transformation of synaptic activity to the hemodynamic response , and a bilinear model that describes how activity changes as a function of inputs , connections , and modulations . For expediency , we focus of the latter . Formally , the bilinear model consists of the following equation: dxdt=[A+\u2211j=1mujB ( j ) ]x+Cu Here , x denotes the state of the system . In other words , x describes the activity level of each region in the modeled system . u denotes inputs into the system , which are the external inputs applied to the system ( i . e . stimuli ) . Given x and u , DCM estimates the dynamics of the system ( i . e . dxdt ) by estimating three parameters: 1 ) A , which describes the fixed connectivity between regions in the system , 2 ) C , which describes the sensitivity of different regions to external inputs , and 3 ) B , which describes the modulations of connectivity as a function of experimental manipulation j . Our model included FPl , MFG , IFS , cMFG , IFJ , and SFS described above . ROIs were identified in each individual through main effects contrasts of Temporal Control ( FPl and MFG ) , Contextual Control ( IFS and cMFG ) , and Stimulus Domain ( IFJ and SFS ) . 6\u00a0mm spherical ROIs were centered around each individual\u2019s activation peak closest to the peak in the respective group contrast . In most cases ( 121/144 , 84% ) , a peak could be identified at whole-brain corrected levels . In the few cases ( 7/144 , 5% ) where a peak could not be identified at a lenient p<0 . 05 uncorrected threshold , the peak from the respective group contrast was used . Fixed connections were based upon documented structural connectivity in the LPFC ( reviewed in Badre and D'Esposito , 2009 ) . All fixed connections were assumed to be bidirectional with the strength of connectivity along each direction free to vary . Our fixed connection assumptions were further tested by examining interconnectivity among our LPFC ROIs in resting state data collected during each fMRI session . For each ROI , we calculated connectivity for all other voxels of the brain through a simple time-series correlation . Next , we sorted these connectivity values , excluding voxels within 1 . 5 cm of the center of the ROI . To determine whether an LPFC region , r , was connected to the ROI , we asked whether connectivity between the ROI and r fell within the top c% of connectivity values , where c can be considered the cost . Connectivity was assessed at a range of costs from 5 to 35 . At low costs , connectivity was sparse and at high costs connectivity was dense ( Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 4 ) . Therefore , we chose a cost in the middle of our range ( 18% ) that was consistent with other studies in our laboratory ( Gratton et al . , 2012 ) , and which produced a connectivity structure that resembled documented structural connectivity . Notably , we initially included rMFG in these analyses and found that rMFG was only connected to other LPFC regions at the very peak of our cost range ( >34 ) . Thus , it was deemed that rMFG was part of a distinct network and it was not included in DCM and other analyses . In all models , we assumed that letter/location inputs arrived at the caudal-most aspects of the system , consistent with the dense connections of these areas to posterior areas involved in stimulus representation ( Petrides , 2005 ) . Furthermore , we assumed domain-segregation such that spatial stimuli arrived at SFS , and verbal stimuli arrived at IFJ ( Goldman-Rakic , 1987; Romanski , 2004 ) , which was consistent with our univariate results demonstrating that these areas were the most active for those respective conditions . Cues denoting the appropriate sub-task were set as inputs into MFG consistent with its role in representing task rules ( Nee and Brown , 2012; Bunge et al . , 2005; Genovesio et al . , 2005; Wallis et al . , 2001 ) . This assumption was bolstered by a univariate analysis demonstrating that MFG was the most active among the LPFC ROIs during the sub-tasks , and also by preliminary DCM\u2019s that directly compared models assuming cue input to MFG versus FPl , which demonstrated superior model fits for the former across a range of other parameters . Inputs were modeled as impulse events occurring at the onset of each stimulus . Of central interest in DCM is how connectivity is modulated as a function of experimental manipulation . To investigate this matter , we used Bayesian model selection to adjudicate between different models positing different forms of connectivity modulation ( Stephan et al . , 2009 ) . We examined how experimental manipulations of Stimulus Domain , Contextual Control , and Temporal Control modulated connectivity among the LPFC . Stimulus Domain was split separately into verbal and spatial factors . Modulations were explored during the sub-task phases of each block , modeling the same periods as the univariate analyses described above . We restricted exploration of modulations among areas showing a univariate effect of experimental manipulation ( Friston et al . , 2003 ) . Explicitly , Spatial Stimulus Domain between SFS and cMFG , Verbal Stimulus Domain between IFJ and IFS , Temporal Control between FPl and MFG , and Contextual Control between all connected areas . We also explored lateral connectivity in the case of Stimulus Domain ( IFJ-SFS , IFS-cMFG ) to examine the possibility of inhibitory segregation . In different models , we estimated parameters assuming top-down , bottom-up , bi-directional , or no modulation . In this framework , there are over 20 , 000 potential models . We estimated that exhaustive exploration of the model space would take years of computational time . To make the problem computationally tractable , we reduced the model space by yoking the directionality of dorsal and ventral pathway modulations ( e . g . if Spatial Stimulus Domain was a bottom-up modulator , then Verbal Stimulus Domain was also a bottom-up modulator for a particular model ) . Furthermore , we did not explore disjointed modulation in the case of the Contextual Control factor ( i . e . modulations of rostral and caudal connections , but not mid-level connections ) . Finally , we used an iterative approach to traverse the remaining model space . First , we found the best model for modulations by Stimulus Domain ( Model S ) . Next , assuming S , we found the best model for modulations by Temporal Control ( Model T ) . Next , assuming S and T , we found the best model for modulations by Contextual Control ( Model C ) . Thereafter , we revisited Stimulus Domain modulations assuming T and C ( Model S\u2019 ) , then commensurately revisited Temporal Control assuming S\u2019 and C , and so on . We iterated this process until convergence . In each phase , the best model was chosen through Bayesian model selection as the model showing the highest model exceedance probability assuming random effects ( Stephan et al . , 2009 ) . The model exceedance probability is the probability of one model being more likely than any other model under consideration . The random effects procedure allows for the possibility of different models/strategies across participants and is far more robust against outliers than fixed effects procedures . Across the 6 iterations of the iterative procedure , the mean model exceedance probability of the best model was 0 . 72 ( range 0 . 54\u20130 . 86 ) . A total of 99 models were explored across the iterations . Comparing across the 99 tested models , the model that the iterative approach settled upon had a model exceedance probability of 0 . 18 ( compare to a uniform of 0 . 01 ) . This was more than twice the model exceedance probability of the next best model . Only 5 models had a model exceedance probability over 0 . 05 . All of these 5 models were highly similar to one another ( Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 5 ) . Hence , it is unlikely that the appropriate model for the observed dynamics is far different from the one explored in the text . Random effects inference on parameters was performed on the winning model . These parameters included the strength of fixed connectivity ( A matrix ) , input sensitivity ( C matrix ) , and the strength of connectivity modulations ( B matrix ) . P-values were corrected for multiple comparisons using false-discovery rate . To determine the robustness of these parameters , we split the dataset in two using an alternating runs procedure , excluding the participant that completed only a single session ( Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . To examine the relationship between top-down modulations , bottom-up modulations , and higher-level cognitive ability , we created factors for each metric using principle components analysis . The first eigenvariate was computed across all top-down modulations , all bottom-up modulations , and all trait-measures of cognitive ability , respectively . Signs were adjusted , if needed , so that higher positive values were associated with more of a given measure . These factors were then inter-correlated . To examine hierarchical strength , we contrasted the average efferent connectivity of a region with the average afferent connectivity along the rostral/caudal axis ( connections running dorsal/ventral were ignored ) . This approach is similar to that used in a recent study involving hierarchical projections in the monkey ( Goulas et al . , 2014 ) . Since the meaning of negative connectivity is unclear in this procedure , negative connections were set to 0 ( 17% of all connections across participants ) . The results remain if we omit this assumption . To provide a summary measure of hierarchical strength of mid LPFC , we fit a quadratic function to each participants\u2019 hierarchical strength metrics . In these models , the y-coordinate of each ROI , reflecting rostral/caudal location , was used as the predictor variable , while hierarchical strength was used as the predicted variable . The vertex of the quadratic function corresponds to either the apex of the hierarchy ( peak ) or basin of the hierarchy ( trough ) . Inferences were performed on the rostral/caudal position and height of the vertex . The height of the vertex was used as a summary of hierarchical strength of fixed connectivity , and was correlated with the higher-level cognitive ability factor described above . Correlations were supplemented by robust regression , which reduces the impact of high-leverage outliers .", "headings": ["Abstract", "Introduction", "Results", "Discussion", "Materials and methods"], "keywords": ["neuroscience"], "id": "elife-12112-v1"}
{"lay_summary": "The outer layer of the mammalian brain the cerebral cortex plays a key role in memory , attention , awareness and thought . While rodents have a smooth cortical surface , the cortex of larger mammals such as primates is organized into folds and furrows . These folds increase the amount of cortex that can fit inside the confines of the skull , and are thought to have allowed the evolution of more advanced thought processes . Mutations in various genes are likely to have contributed to the expansion and folding of the cortex . These mutations may not always have involved changes in the instructions encoded within the genes , but might instead have involved changes in the number of copies of a gene . One plausible candidate gene is TBC1D3 , which is only found in the great apes and is active in the cortex . The chimpanzee genome contains a single copy of TBC1D3 whereas the human genome contains multiple copies . Ju , Hou et al . have now shown that introducing the TBC1D3 gene into mouse embryos triggers changes in the embryonic cortex . Specifically , this gene increases the number of a type of cell called the outer radial glial cell in the cortex . These cells give rise to new neurons , and are usually rare in mice but abundant in the brains of animals with a folded cortex . Additional experiments using samples of human brain tissue confirmed that TBC1D3 is required for the outer radial glial cells to form . The samples were collected from miscarried fetuses with the informed consent of the patients and following approved protocols and ethical guidelines . Finally , introducing the TBC1D3 gene into the mouse genome also gave rise to animals with a folded cortex , rather than their usual smooth brain surface . Further work is now required to identify how TBC1D3 helps to generate outer radial glial cells , and to work out how these cells cause the cortex to expand . Testing the behavior of mice with the TBC1D3 gene could also uncover the links between cortical folding and thought processes .", "article": "Cortical expansion and folding are often linked to the evolution of higher intelligence , but molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying cortical folding remain poorly understood . The hominoid-specific gene TBC1D3 undergoes segmental duplications during hominoid evolution , but its role in brain development has not been explored . Here , we found that expression of TBC1D3 in ventricular cortical progenitors of mice via in utero electroporation caused delamination of ventricular radial glia cells ( vRGs ) and promoted generation of self-renewing basal progenitors with typical morphology of outer radial glia ( oRG ) , which are most abundant in primates . Furthermore , down-regulation of TBC1D3 in cultured human brain slices decreased generation of oRGs . Interestingly , localized oRG proliferation resulting from either in utero electroporation or transgenic expression of TBC1D3 , was often found to underlie cortical regions exhibiting folding . Thus , we have identified a hominoid gene that is required for oRG generation in regulating the cortical expansion and folding . \n It is generally assumed that the expansion of the mammalian neocortex during evolution correlates with the increase in intelligence , and this process involves increased production of cortical neurons , resulting from an extended neurogenic period as well as increased proliferative ability of neural stem cells and progenitors ( Geschwind and Rakic , 2013; Lui et al . , 2011; Sun and Hevner , 2014; Zilles et al . , 2013 ) . To fit into a limited cranium , expanded cortical surfaces are folded to form gyri and sulci . Recent cross-species studies have shown the emergence of an outer subventricular zone ( OSVZ ) in the primate cortex , consisting of a massive pool of proliferating basal progenitors ( BPs ) and post-mitotic neurons ( Betizeau et al . , 2013; Fietz et al . , 2010; Hansen et al . , 2010; Reillo et al . , 2011; Smart et al . , 2002 ) . Unlike the neuroepithelia-derived ventricular radial glial cells , which undergo repeated and typically asymmetric cell division at the apical surface of the ventricular zone , the BPs , after delamination from the apical surface , translocate to the SVZ , where they exhibit symmetric or asymmetric divisions . In primates , the recently identified outer ( basal ) radial glia ( referred to as oRG or bRG ) and the intermediate progenitors ( IPs ) in the OSVZ , which can undergo multiple rounds of symmetric or asymmetric divisions ( Betizeau et al . , 2013; Hansen et al . , 2010 ) , are two major forms of BPs . By contrast , the IPs and minimal oRG cells in the mouse SVZ usually exhibit final division to generate a pair of post-mitotic neurons ( Shitamukai et al . , 2011; Wang et al . , 2011 ) . The radial and lateral expansion of BPs is thought to be a main cause of cortical folding of gyrencephalic species ( Fietz and Huttner , 2011; Fietz et al . , 2010; Hansen et al . , 2010; Lewitus et al . , 2014; Lui et al . , 2011; Reillo et al . , 2011 ) . In support of this hypothesis , forced expansion of BPs by down-regulating the DNA-associated protein Trnp1 or overexpressing cell cycle regulatory proteins Cdk4/Cyclin D1 resulted in gyrification of the cerebral cortex in naturally lissencephalic mouse or gyrencephalic ferret ( Nonaka-Kinoshita et al . , 2013; Stahl et al . , 2013 ) . Given that genetic differences between humans and other species are likely to be the causes of human-specific traits , including complexity of cortical morphology , extensive studies have been performed in comparing genes and genetic elements of different species of primates and mammals ( Arcila et al . , 2014; Fietz et al . , 2012; Florio et al . , 2015; Johnson et al . , 2009 , 2015; Kang et al . , 2011; Konopka et al . , 2012; Lui et al . , 2014; Miller et al . , 2014; O'Bleness et al . , 2012 ) . In particular , several recent studies have aimed to uncover the distinctive transcriptional signature of the expanded human OSVZ or BPs that reside there , leading to the identification of a group of genes highly expressed in the human OSVZ ( Miller et al . , 2014 ) , and human-specific orthologs preferentially expressed in human RGs ( Florio et al . , 2015; Lui et al . , 2014; Miller et al . , 2014; Pollen et al . , 2015; Thomsen et al . , 2016 ) . For examples , platelet-derived growth factor D is expressed specifically and functionally important in human but not mouse RGs ( Lui et al . , 2014 ) . A human lineage-specific Rho GTPase-activating protein could enhance the generation of IPs and cause neocortex expansion when expressed in the mouse brain ( Florio et al . , 2015 ) . Since cortical folding emerges progressively during primate evolution , multiple primate- and hominid-specific genes are likely to be involved in the emergence of cortical folding . Gene duplication may play critical roles in brain evolution ( Geschwind and Rakic , 2013 ) . In particular , duplication of specific genes in humans may be responsible for the marked increase in cortical folding . The TBC1D3 gene is derived from a segmental duplication , with multiple copies present in the human chromosome 17 and present in the chimpanzee genome as a single copy gene ( but absent in other species ) ( Hodzic et al . , 2006; Pei et al . , 2002; Perry et al . , 2008; Zody et al . , 2006 ) . Indeed , TBC1D3 corresponds to one of the core duplicons that have been implicated in the expansion of intrachromosomal segmental duplications during hominoid evolution ( Jiang et al . , 2007 ) . Because the timing of origination and amplification of the TBC1D3 gene is consistent with the evolutionary divergence of primates ( Perry et al . , 2008; Stahl and Wainszelbaum , 2009 ) , we decided to explore its role in brain development by expressing this gene in mice . We found TBC1D3 expression markedly elevated the generation and proliferation of BPs and resulted in extensive cortex folding in the mouse brain , and further delineated the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying its action . Furthermore , TBC1D3 is essential for the generation of BPs in cultured developing human brain slices . The transgenic mice generated in this study may provide a feasible model to link cortical folding to higher brain functions . \n A previous study showed that TBC1D3 paralogues are expressed in most human tissues , including the brain ( Hodzic et al . , 2006 ) . By using reverse transcription PCR , we found that the expression of TBC1D3 in the fetal human brain ( gestational week , GW 26 to 40 ) was higher than that in the adult ( Figure 1A ) . Immunofluorescence staining of cortical sections obtained from GW18 human specimens during the peak period of neurogenesis revealed high TBC1D3 expression near the ventricular surface and in the subventricular zone ( SVZ ) ( Figure 1B ) , suggesting a role of TBC1D3 in cortex development . 10 . 7554/eLife . 18197 . 003Figure 1 .

Scale bars , 20 \u03bcm . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 18197 . 005 To investigate the potential role of TBC1D3 in neural development , we introduced human TBC1D3 expression construct pE/nestin-TBC1D3 together with pCAG-YFP into neural precursors in the ventricular zone ( VZ ) of fetal mice at embryonic day 13 . 5 ( E13 . 5 ) , using in utero electroporation . At E15 . 5 , in situ\u00a0hybridization with an antisense TBC1D3 probe showed that the transcript was expressed in TBC1D3-electroporated mice but not in control mice injected with the vehicle construct ( Figure 1C ) , consistent with the absence of TBC1D3 in the murine genome ( Hodzic et al . , 2006 ) . Interestingly , expression of TBC1D3 caused delamination of ventricular radial glia ( vRG ) , and a decreased level of N-cadherin at adherens junctions ( AJs ) ( Figure 1D ) at the ventricular surface . The reduction in N-cadherin was probably due to either the transcriptional inhibition or destabilization of transcripts , because in situ hybridization and real-time PCR showed marked reduction of N-cadherin ( Cdh2 ) transcript in VZ cells ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A ) and flow cytometry-sorted YFP+ cells expressing TBC1D3 ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B\u2013D ) , respectively . Further analyses showed that expression of TBC1D3 indeed caused destabilization of Cdh2 mRNA in ReNeuron human neural progenitor cell line ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1E , F ) . Since N-cadherin is known to be important for maintaining the alignment of radial glial cells at VZ ( Kadowaki et al . , 2007 ) , reduction of N-cadherin due to TBC1D3 expression may be causally related to the delamination of ventricular neuroprogenitors . Indeed , we found that expression of TBC1D3 caused dislocalization of Numb and integrin beta 1 ( ITGB1 ) which were originally polarized distributed in endfeet of vRGs ( Campos et al . , 2004; Katayama et al . , 2011; Rasin et al . , 2007 ) , without disrupting the junction integrity of the VZ as revealed by actin filaments ( F-actin ) ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . Observation in the SVZ and intermediate zone ( IZ ) of E16 . 5 mice ( electroporated at E13 . 5 ) showed that delaminated TBC1D3-expressing cells often exhibited clustered distribution by forming vertical column-like structures ( Figure 1E ) , reminiscent of ontogenic radial units ( Rakic , 1988 ) , expansion of which has been proposed to underlie cortical folding ( Borrell and Gotz , 2014; Florio and Huttner , 2014; Lui et al . , 2011; Rakic , 1988 ) . This column-like aggregation of basal cells induced by TBC1D3 expression may result from increased number of proliferating cells originated from VZ ( see below ) , and leads to lateral heterogeneity in the rate of neuronal production that may contribute to cortical folding . Previous studies have shown that disruption of AJs due to the loss of RhoA in neural progenitors is accompanied by an elevated proliferation of neuroprogenitors ( Katayama et al . , 2011 ) . We thus examine the effect of TBC1D3 expression via in utero electroporation on neuroprogenitor proliferation by calculating the proportion of cells in S phase , as assayed by the incorporation of pyrimidine analog bromodeoxyuridine ( BrdU ) for 2 hr before sacrificing the electroporated mice ( Figure 2A , B ) . We found that TBC1D3 expression caused an increase in BrdU-positive ( BrdU+ ) proliferating cells , as compared to that of control mice electroporated with vehicle construct ( Figure 2C , E ) . In an additional control experiment , we found that expressing a mutated form of TBC1D3 , with the deletion of amino acids 286 to 353 ( \u2206286\u2013353 ) essential for its cytoplasmic retention ( He et al . , 2014 ) , in neural progenitors had no effect on BrdU incorporation ( Figure 2C , E ) . These results suggest that cytoplasmic presence of TBC1D3 promotes the proliferation of early neural precursors . Interestingly , the TBC1D3-induced population of BrdU+ cells scattered widely across the cortex , from VZ to CP , with the highest concentration in SVZ ( Figure 2B , C , F ) , indicating increased generation of BPs . The identity of these basal localized cells as BPs was further revealed by positive labeling by Ki67 , a marker for cells in cell cycle , and negative labeling by NeuN , a marker for post-mitotic neurons ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . This effect of TBC1D3 expression was also confirmed by the increase in the proportion of cells stained with the mitotic marker phosphorylated Histone ( PH3+ ) in basal regions and a decrease in cells attached to the ventricular surface ( Figure 2D , G ) . The seemingly non-cell autonomous effect of TBC1D3 expression on proliferation of BPs was most likely caused by different dosages of pE/nestin-TBC1D3 and pCAG-YFP ( 3:1 ) used in electroporation , because electroporation with pCAGGS-TBC1D3-IRES-EGFP , a vector co-expressing both TBC1D3 and EGFP , caused increase in numbers of basal BrdU+ or PH3+ cells in EGFP+ but not in EGFP- cells ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . The notable slight decrease of EGFP- apical neural progenitors might be due to the disruption of proliferation niche in VZ regions ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2B , D , left ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 18197 . 006Figure 2 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 18197 . 010 This increased number of proliferating BPs in basal regions could be caused by increased number of delaminated cells as well as by elevated proliferative capacity of BPs upon TBC1D3 expression . We found that the increase in PH3+ BPs was largely abolished when TBC1D3 and N-cadherin were co-expressed in neuroprogenitors via in utero electroporation ( Figure 2D , G ) , consistent with the contribution of delamination to the increased number of proliferating BPs . To determine whether delamination itself is sufficient to transform vRG to BPs , we over-expressed in vRG the extracellular domain ( EC1 ) of N-cadherin , which has been shown to be capable of disrupting the homophilic intercellular N-cadherin interaction ( Tan et al . , 2010 ) , and found that EC1 expression caused detachment of vRG cells ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3A , B ) but had no effect on the proliferation of either apical or basal cells ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3C\u2013F ) . Thus , detachment of vRG cells is a necessary but not a sufficient step for the generation of proliferative BPs . How does TBC1D3 expression maintain the high proliferative capacity of detached RG cells ? TBC1D3 has been shown to promote cell proliferation ( Pei et al . , 2002 ) , activate Ras and enhance EGF/EGFR and insulin signaling in non-neuronal cells ( Wainszelbaum et al . , 2008 , 2012 ) . In line with this notion , we found that the effect of TBC1D3 on the proliferation of BPs was markedly abrogated by co-expression with RasS17N ( Ras-DN ) , a dominant-negative form of Ras ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4 ) . This result suggests the involvement of Ras signaling in the proliferation of TBC1D3-induced BPs , indicating multiple actions of TBC1D3 in causing increased expansion of BPs . In mice , intermediate progenitors ( IPs ) that express the transcription factor Tbr2 in the SVZ are the major type of BPs , which undergo terminal division ( Lui et al . , 2011; Noctor et al . , 2004 ) . In primates , however , a recently identified subtype of BPs , namely outer radial glia ( oRG ) or basal radial glia ( bRG ) , represents the predominant BPs in the expanded OSVZ ( Smart et al . , 2002 ) . These oRG cells express RG marker Pax6 and/or Sox2 and can divide multiple times to generate many daughter oRG or IPs ( Fietz et al . , 2010; Hansen et al . , 2010 ) . By contrast , the lissencephalic mouse embryonic cortex contains very few oRG cells , which divide only once to generate two neurons ( Wang et al . , 2011 ) . Highly proliferative oRG cells are thought to be critical for the expansion of primate brain cerebral cortex ( Hansen et al . , 2010; Sun and Hevner , 2014 ) . Remarkably , we found that TBC1D3 expression caused an increase in Pax6+ cells in the mouse cortex , especially in the basal regions ( Figure 3A\u2013C ) . The RG identity of these cells was further corroborated by the oRG-like morphology and the mode of division . In TBC1D3-expressing mouse cortical slices , we observed that many Sox2+ or Pax6+ BPs exhibited a single process pointing to the pial surface with intense signals of mitosis-specific phospho-Vimentin ( p-Vim ) ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013D ) , similar to unipolar oRGs identified in the human fetal brain ( Fietz et al . , 2010; Hansen et al . , 2010 ) . However , in control mice , the percentage of Sox2+/p-Vim+ or Pax6+/p-Vim+ cells with a basal process was much lower ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013D ) . This pial surface contact by oRG process was further examined by application of fluorescent membrane probe DiI to the isolated brain prior to sectioning . In TBC1D3-expressing cortices , we observed many oRG-like cells with a basal process attaching the pial surface and without the apical process attached to the VZ surface ( Figure 3D , F ) . In the control cortices , however , most RGs had both apical and basal processes attaching the pial and VZ surfaces respectively ( Figure 3D , F ) . Thus , TBC1D3 expression promoted production of oRG cells , which are normally rather rare in mice . In addition , we observed an increase in Tbr2+ BPs at 96 hr after electroporation with TBC1D3 construct at E13 . 5 ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1E , F ) , in accordance with the linage relationship between oRG cells and IPs ( Hansen et al . , 2010 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 18197 . 011Figure 3 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 18197 . 013 To further identify oRG cells among proliferating BPs , we performed time-lapse imaging of \u2018mitotic somal translocation\u2019 ( MST ) before cytokinesis , a typical oRG behavior during cell division ( Hansen et al . , 2010 ) . We labeled individual progenitors with H2B-GFP to trace nuclear motion and tdTomato to reveal cell morphology without or with co-electroporation with TBC1D3 expression vector pCS2-Myc-TBC1D3 , and brains were sliced 24 hr later for time-lapse imaging . In agreement with the above finding of increased oRG population , the number of cells with MST was markedly higher in TBC1D3-expressing slices , as compared to controls ( Figure 3E , G ) . To visualize and identify the types of oRGs and their daughter cells generated by TBC1D3 expression , we electroporated E13 . 5 mice with pCAGGS-TBC1D3-IRES-EGFP plasmids ( or pCAGGS-IRES-EGFP as the control ) , followed with time-lapse imaging ( Videos 1 , 2 ) and immunostaining ( Figure 3H\u2013L ) of E14 . 5 brain slices . More than half ( 74/120 ) of proliferating cells labeled by pCAGGS-TBC1D3-IRES-EGFP were typical oRG with a single basal process and an upward MST ( Figure 3H , I ) . In agreement with that observed in the primate OSVZ ( Betizeau et al . , 2013 ) , we also observed other types of oRGs , including bipolar cells with both apical and basal processes ( 42/120 ) and a few cells with a single apical process and a downward MST ( 4/120 ) ( Figure 3H , I ) . Post-imaging immunostaining of cell markers showed that , in TBC1D3-electroporated samples , a large fraction of either apical or basal daughter cells derived from oRG cells exhibiting MST continued to express Sox2 but not Tbr2 ( Figure 3J\u2013L ) , consistent with oRG cells with the capacity for multiple rounds of cell division . In line with this notion , birth dating analysis using sequential labeling with BrdU and EdU showed that the fraction of BrdU+EdU+ cells was higher in basal regions of TBC1D3-expressing cortices , as compared to that of controls ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . Thus , TBC1D3 expression in mice had endowed the primate-like proliferative potency of oRG cells . Taken together , these results show that the primary action of TBC1D3 expression is to promote the generation of oRG cells with high proliferative capacity , leading to expansion of BPs . 10 . 7554/eLife . 18197 . 014Video 1 . oRGs in cultured organotypic slices from control mice .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 18197 . 015 To further determine whether TBC1D3 is really essential for the generation of oRG cells in the developing human brain , we took advantage of small interference RNA ( siRNA ) and investigated the effect of TBC1D3 down-regulation on basal cortical neural progenitors of human brain slices ( Figure 4A\u2013F ) . As shown in Figure 4A , the constructs encoding TBC1D3 siRNAs ( 1033 , 3B , or 440 ) down-regulated the expression of TBC1D3 in cultured Hela cells in various degrees with siTBC1D3-440 exhibiting most effective effect . Next , vRG cells in cultured fetal human brain slices were transfected with TBC1D3 or control siRNA using electroporation ( Figure 4B ) . After culture for 72 hr , we found that electroporated cells in control samples exhibited normal delamination and a large fraction of them translocated to SVZ regions with typical morphology of oRG cells , whereas majority of siTBC1D3-electroporated cells remained in VZ regions ( Figure 4C , D ) . These results suggest that TBC1D3 is critical for the generation of oRG cells . In line with this notion , basal cells positive for Sox2 , which largely represents oRG cells ( Pollen et al . , 2015; Thomsen et al . , 2016 ) , were also markedly decreased in siTBC1D3-expressing samples ( Figure 4E , F ) . This effect was unlikely caused by off-target effect of siTBC1D3 , because co-expression with TBC1D3 largely rescued the defect caused by TBC1D3 down-regulation ( Figure 4E , F ) . In agreement with the result that TBC1D3 destabilized Cdh2 transcript , we found that transfection with TBC1D3 siRNA markedly increased stability of Cdh2 mRNA in human neural progenitor ReNeuron cells ( Figure 4G ) . Taken together , TBC1D3 plays a critical role in the generation of BPs during human brain development . 10 . 7554/eLife . 18197 . 016Figure 4 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 18197 . 016 Although the cortex of small rodents is lissencephalic , it has the potential of forming fissures and folds , as shown in recent studies using regional down-regulation of a DNA-associated protein Trnp1 ( Stahl et al . , 2013 ) or exogenous application of FGF2 protein in early mouse embryos ( Rash et al . , 2013 ) . We found that about one third of mice electroporated with the TBC1D3 construct in neuroprogenitors at E13 . 5 showed apparent folding of the cortex at regions containing electroporated cells when observed three days postnatal ( P3 ) ( Figure 5A ) . At P7 , the cortical folding was more pronounced ( Figure 5A ) , suggesting a cumulative effect of TBC1D3 on the formation of gyrus-like cortical folding in mice . The cortical surface 48 hr after electroporation showed continuous signals of laminin in both control and TBC1D3-electroporated samples ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1 ) , largely excluding the possibility that the later observed cortical folding might be attributed to the disruption of pial basement membrane . 10 . 7554/eLife . 18197 . 017Figure 5 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 18197 . 021 To further determine the effect of TBC1D3 expression on cortical cytoarchitecture , we generated transgenic ( TG ) mice that expressed TBC1D3 under the control of the nestin promoter ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2A ) . Three independent founder lines were generated with line 10 exhibiting highest copy number and expression level ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2B , C ) , and thus line 10 was used for further breading and analyses . Immunostaining indicated that TBC1D3 is mainly distributed in the cytoplasm of Pax6+ RG cells ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2D ) . Notably , the expression level of TBC1D3 was progressively increased from early to later embryonic stages ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2E ) . Beginning from E14 . 5 , we observed apparent protrusion of layer 2/3 cells towards the pial surface in the cortex of all TG mice examined ( Figure 5B , C; arrows ) , clear folding of cortical surface could be discerned on cortical surfaces or slices with Nissl staining in P3 . 5 and in adult mice ( Figure 5D\u2013F; asterisks and arrows ) . Immunostaining of Cux1 and Ctip2 , markers for layer 2/3 and layer 5 cortical neurons , respectively , showed clear lamination in the cortex of both control and TG mice , but the TG cortex showed gyrus-like folding ( Figure 5C , G ) . Staining of pan-neuronal marker NeuN and astrocyte marker GFAP also showed folding of the cortical surface in adult TG mice ( Figure 5G , H ) . We did not observe apparent difference in vertical distribution of new born cortical neurons in TG mice ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3 ) , suggesting that cortical folding was unlikely due to neuronal migration defects . Gross observation showed that all P3 . 5 TG mice examined exhibited gyrus-like phenotypes in various degrees ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 4A ) . Analysis for whole-brain serial sections showed that these gyrus-like structures were mainly distributed in the primary ( M1 ) and secondary ( M2 ) motor cortex ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 4B\u2013E ) . This localized effect may be attributed to temporal restriction of TBC1D3 expression in RG cells of TG mice and the rostral-to-caudal temporal progression of neurogenesis observed in several mammalian species ( Caviness et al . , 1995; McSherry and Smart , 1986; Rakic , 1974 ) . Furthermore , we have determined the pattern of neurogenesis in TG mice . At E12 . 5 , the TG mice exhibited an increase in proliferating PH3+ BPs , with a wide distribution across basal regions of the cortex , whereas only a single distinct layer contained PH3+ cells in control mice ( Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013D ) . More strikingly , we observed a marked increase in the population of Sox2+Pax6+Tbr2- cells in basal regions ( Figure 6A , B ) and more than half of them exhibited typical morphology of oRG cells ( Figure 6C ) . The presence of elevated oRG cells in the basal regions was also determined by DiI back-labeling on embryos of TG mice ( Figure 6D , E ) . Similar to that observed in electroporation experiment ( see Figure 1E ) , some of the basal Sox2+Tbr2- cells exhibited clustered distribution ( Figure 6F , G ) . Notably , clustered columns of Sox2+Pax6+Tbr2- cells were observed beneath regions of protrusion ( as defined by DAPI staining of cells ) at E14 . 5 ( Figure 6H ) , supporting the ontogeny unit hypothesis for cortex expansion ( Rakic , 1988 ) . Unlike basal Pax6+ cells , relative density of total Pax6+ only slightly increased ( Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1E , F ) . Sequential labeling with BrdU and EdU for mice at E13 . 5 and E16 . 5 also showed an increase in the number of EdU+BrdU+ basal progenitors in TG mice ( Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . These results further support the conclusion based on in utero electroporation studies that TBC1D3 expression promotes the generation of highly proliferative BPs in mice . Besides morphological features and mode of division , several molecular markers have been identified for oRG cells , including HOPX ( Pollen et al . , 2015; Thomsen et al . , 2016 ) . Interestingly , many HOPX+ cells were observed in basal extra-VZ regions of TG mice , whereas these cells were barely detectable in WT control mice ( Figure 6I , J ) . Thus , we conclude that TBC1D3 expression promotes generation of oRG cells in mice . 10 . 7554/eLife . 18197 . 022Figure 6 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 18197 . 025 We next examined whether neuronal density in the cortex is affected in TG mice expressing TBC1D3 . Brain sections were immunostained with Cux1/Ctip2 or NeuN/GFAP . At both P3 . 5 and P28 , TG mice exhibited increased neuronal density in the motor cortex showing surface folding , particularly in the layer 2/3 ( Cux1+ ) , as compared to corresponding regions in WT littermates ( Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3A\u2013E ) . In adult mice ( P28 ) , we did not observe apparent changes in the density of GFAP+ astrocytes ( Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3C , F ) . These results suggest that TBC1D3-induced cortical expansion is mainly due to increased number of neurons rather than astrocytes . Although cortical folding was enriched in motor cortex , we also observed a mild increase in the density of Cux1+ in sensory cortex , which formed much less folds ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 4 and Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3G , H ) . Because delamination and elevation of the proliferative capacity of BPs are both required to account for the observed TBC1D3-induced oRG generation and cortical folding , we further examined the effect of TBC1D3 expression on the intrinsic stemness signaling pathways in BPs . Interestingly , we found that TBC1D3 expression in neuroprogenitors by in utero electroporation at E13 . 5 caused a reduced expression of Trnp1 in flow cytometry-sorted cells at E15 . 5 , as compared to that found in control cells sorted from vehicle-electroporated mice ( Figure 7A ) , consistent with the finding that regional down-regulation of Trnp1 expression causes cortical folding in mice ( Stahl et al . , 2013 ) . Unlike the role in destabilizing Cdh2 transcript , TBC1D3 expression had no effect on the stability of Trnp1 mRNA ( Figure 7E ) . This result indicates a linkage between TBC1D3 and known factors that modulate fate transition from RGs to BPs . In addition to Trnp1 , Notch signaling has been proposed to play a role in maintaining the progenitor status of human oRG cells ( Hansen et al . , 2010 ) . However , we found that TBC1D3 expression had no effect on the transcriptional level of Hes1 and Hes5 , effecters of Notch signaling , as well as Numb , which encodes an endocytic adaptor protein that acts as a Notch pathway inhibitor localized to the apical membrane ( Figure 7B\u2013D ) . The Ras-Raf-ERK signaling cascade mediates the mitotic role of EGF/EGFR signaling pathway in promoting cell proliferation ( Citri and Yarden , 2006 ) . We found that the signals for activated phospho-ERK1/2 ( pERK1/2 ) were elevated in TBC1D3 TG mice , mostly in VZ/SVZ regions ( Figure 7F , G ) , in line with the previous observation that TBC1D3 enhanced the ERK signaling ( Wainszelbaum et al . , 2008 , 2012 ) . Notably , almost all ( 99 . 1% ) of Pax6+Tbr2- oRG cells in developing human cortex were positively stained by pERK1/2 ( Figure 7H , I ) , further supporting the role of ERK signaling in oRG proliferation . The combined actions of TBC1D3 on parallel or separate cell proliferation pathways may account for the observed role of TBC1D3 in maintaining cell stemness potency . 10 . 7554/eLife . 18197 . 026Figure 7 . Effect of TBC1D3 on intrinsic stemness signaling pathways and model for the TBC1D3 function in cortical folding . ( A\u2013D ) E13 . 5 mice were subjected to IUE with TBC1D3 or vehicle control plasmid , together with YFP plasmid , and at E15 . 5 , FACS-sorted transfected cells ( see Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B , C ) were analyzed for mRNA levels of indicated genes relative to GAPDH with values from control groups normalized as 1 . 0 ( n = 3 experiments for each group ) .

( J ) Proposed model for the role of TBC1D3 in cortical folding . TBC1D3 expression causes delamination of vRG cells , through down-regulating the level of N-cadherin and Trnp1 , and promotes proliferation of oRG-like cells by regulating cell stemness pathways , including Ras/ERK signaling . The increased generation of the oRG-like cells , the IP cells , and subsequently regional increase in the density of new born neurons , induces cortical folding in mice . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 18197 . 026 \n In this study , we found a remarkable effect of the hominoid-specific gene TBC1D3 in promoting the generation of oRG cells in mice with a high proliferative ability previously observed in primates . Importantly , this oRG generation is accompanied by the appearance of cortical folding . Furthermore , we elucidated the cellular mechanisms underlying the generation of proliferative oRG cells by showing that TBC1D3 expresssion caused increased delamination of VZ neuroprogenitors via down-regulation of N-cadherin , and elevated proliferative ability of BPs is accompanied by a reduced expression of Trnp1 and likely involves Ras-ERK signaling cascade . These effects together resulted in the expansion and dispersion of BPs , giving rise to increased number of newborn neurons and leading to cortical folding ( for model see Figure 7J ) . In small rodents , RGs in the VZ and IPs in the SVZ are two major cell types responsible for cortex development . However , amplification of VZ progenitors via overexpression of \u03b2-catenin in the mouse brain led to the folding of the ventricular rather than cortical surface ( Chenn and Walsh , 2002 ) , and amplification of IPs only increased the brain size without inducing cortical folding in mice ( Nonaka-Kinoshita et al . , 2013 ) . Recent studies have established the association between the relative abundance of oRG and the degree of cortical folding in various species ( Betizeau et al . , 2013; Hansen et al . , 2010; Reillo et al . , 2011; Shitamukai et al . , 2011; Wang et al . , 2011 ) . In the present study , we showed that increased population of oRG in mice is accompanied with cortical fold formation , supporting the critical role of highly proliferative oRG in cortical expansion and gyrification in primates . It is postulated that oRG cells are derived from the ventricular RGs , presumably requiring delamination from apical anchoring ( Borrell and Gotz , 2014 ) . However , loss of adherens junction proteins or breaking their linkage to the cytoskeletal belts by down-regulating the small GTPase RhoA ( Cappello et al . , 2012; Lien et al . , 2006 ) had little effect on oRG generation or cortical folding , although apically anchored progenitor cells became delaminated . Thus , delamination of VZ progenitors is not sufficient for generating highly proliferative BPs , and changes in cell cycle regulatory factors are also be required . In the present study , we showed that expression of TBC1D3 led to not only down-regulation of N-cadherin , leading to VZ progenitor delamination , but also reduced Trnp1 expression and enhanced ERK signaling that could be involved in elevated proliferation of delaminated cells . Furthermore , other functions of TBC1D3 may also contribute to the cortical folding phenotype we observed . For examples , cell culture studies of TBC1D3 have suggested its potential role in membrane endocytosis , as well as Ras activation and epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) signaling ( Wainszelbaum et al . , 2008 ) , processes that may be involved in various aspects of neural development leading to cortical folding and gyrification . Indeed , we found that Ras activity was involved in TBC1D3-induced proliferation of BPs . Recent single-cell transcriptome analyses of human oRG cells have identified multiple preferentially expressed genes related to extracellular matrix formation , cell migration , and stemness , including the most specific oRG marker HOPX ( Pollen et al . , 2015; Thomsen et al . , 2016 ) . Strikingly , many HOPX positive cells were observed in TBC1D3 TG mice . The relationship between TBC1D3 expression and these oRG markers remains to be clarified . Simple ectopic localization of RG cells outside of the ventricular zone may not be sufficient to cause cortical expansion or folding as shown in a previous study ( Yoon et al . , 2014 ) . Appearance of oRG-like features , including the contact with pia surface by the basal process , multiple rounds of cell division , expression of specific markers , as well as clustered regional distribution of BPs observed in this study , may play prominent roles in cortical folding . Cortical expansion is assumed to be associated with the emergence of uniquely cognitive skills in primates ( Luders et al . , 2008; Zilles et al . , 2013 ) . However , this hypothesis has been mainly based on across species comparative studies . Global or regional-specific changes in gyrification index ( GI ) have been observed in brains of subjects following various types of extensive training ( Amunts et al . , 1997; Luders et al . , 2012; Luders et al . , 2008 ) . For example , in keyboard players , the local GI increases in response to early onset of professional training and duration of practice , and correlates with motor performance ( Amunts et al . , 1997 ) . Conversely , a significant decline in the cortical GI was observed in patients with mental disorders ( Bonnici et al . , 2007; Wolosin et al . , 2009 ) . Understanding of the precise contribution of cortical expansion and gyrification to cognition functions has been challenging due to the lack of appropriate animal model systems . The deliberate behavior analyses for TG mice generated in this work may provide a link between cortex expansion and higher brain functions . Recently , a human-specific gene ARHGAP11B has been shown to promote production of basal IPs and cause cortical folding in the electroporated mouse brain ( Florio et al . , 2015 ) . We propose that TBC1D3 , which appeared earlier than ARHGAP11B during human evolution ( Florio et al . , 2015; Hodzic et al . , 2006; Perry et al . , 2008 ) , acts as a candidate gene that controls many other genes involved in cortex expansion and folding . Multiple genes underlying different or shared cellular processes associated with neurogenesis may all contribute in part to the formation of cortical folding and gyrification found in primates . Thus , it would be of great interest to elucidate gene expression networks related with TBC1D3 expression . Identification of the \u2018hub\u2019 genes of such networks may further clarify the role of TBC1D3 in the cytoarchitectural development on the cortex . This study provides proof-of-concept that the brain development can be regulated by duplicated genes during hominoid evolution . \n Human fetal brain tissue samples were collected at autopsy within 3 hr of spontaneous abortion with the informed consent of the patients following protocols and institutional ethic guidelines stated in our previous study ( Ma et al . , 2013 ) . Brain tissues were stored in ice-cold Leibowitz-15 medium and transported to the laboratory for further examination and processing ( Lui et al . , 2014 ) . ICR mice were used for all in utero electroporation experiments , and the TBC1D3-transgenic mouse was constructed and kept in the C57BL/6 background . All the mice were housed in the institutional animal care facility with a 12 hr light-dark schedule . The use of all mice in this study was in compliance with the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee . Fetal ( GW 26 to 40 ) or adult ( 21 to 29 years ) human brain RNA samples ( Clontech , Mountain View , CA ) were reverse transcribed into cDNA with QuantScript RT kit using oligo ( dT ) 15 primers ( Tiangen , China ) followed by PCR using TBC1D3 primers: 5\u2019- ATCGAGCGTACAAGGGAATG-3\u2019 ( forward ) , 5\u2019\u2013 CCGTATCGATCCCTGAAGAA-3\u2019 ( reverse ) . GAPDH was used as the control . Fetal human brain RNA ( Clontech ) was reverse transcribed with QuantScript RT kit using oligo ( dT ) 15 primers ( Tiangen ) . TBC1D3 cDNA was acquired by PCR and cloned into pE/nestin-EGFP vectors ( a kind gift from Dr . H . Okano ) ( Kawaguchi et al . , 2001 ) , to generate the pE/nestin-TBC1D3 plasmid after replacing the EGFP sequence . To construct the pCAGGS-TBC1D3-IRES-EGFP plasmid , TBC1D3 cDNA was amplified by PCR from pE/nestin-TBC1D3 and subcloned into the AscI-XhoI site of pCAGGS-IRES-EGFP . The pE/nestin-TBC1D3\u2206286\u2013353 ( \u2206286\u2013353 ) plasmid was produced by site-directed PCR mutagenesis method . The pCS2-Myc-TBC1D3 construct was generated by inserting TBC1D3 cDNA fragment into the EcoRI-XhoI site of pCS2-MT vector . The pKH3-N-cadherin and pCS2-EC1 ( Tan et al . , 2010 ) plasmids were kind gifts from Dr . X . Yu .

After annealing , the oligos were inserted into BglII/HindIII digested pSuper plasmid . In utero electroporation was performed according to the previously reported protocol ( Saito , 2006 ) . In brief , a timed pregnant mouse at E13 . 5 was anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium , the uterine horns were exposed , and ~1 \u03bcl of plasmids mixed with 0 . 1 mg/ml fast green ( Sigma-Aldrich , St . Louis , MO ) were manually microinjected into the lateral ventricle with a beveled sharp glass micropipette ( VWR International , Radnor , PA ) . For electroporation , five 50-ms pulses of 35 mV with a 950-ms interval were applied across the uterus with two 3-mm , in radius , disc electrodes ( BEX , Japan , LF650P3 ) located on either side of the head ( BTX , Holliston , MA , ECM830 ) and the pre-warmed ( 37\u00b0C ) 0 . 9% NaCl was used to keep the uterus wet . After electroporation , the uterus was put back into the abdominal cavity , filled with warmed 0 . 9% NaCl , and the wound was surgically sutured . The mouse was then placed on a warmed blanket before recovery and resuming normal activity . The human neural progenitor cell line ReNeuron was cultured on 0 . 5% ( v/v ) of 1 mg/ml laminin-coated dishes in DMEM/F12 full media containing 2% B27 ( Gibco , Holliston , MA ) , 10 units/ml heparin ( Sigma ) , 20 ng/ml EGF ( Millipore , Temecula , CA ) , and 10 ng/ml bFGF ( Millipore ) . For plasmid transfection , the cultured ReNeuron cells were dissociated into single cells with accutase ( Sigma ) and electroporated in the program X-001 by using the Nucleofector 2b device ( Lonza , Switzerland ) , with plasmids encoding TBC1D3 , siRNA against TBC1D3 , or corresponding vehicle plasmids . At the second ( for TBC1D3 over-expression ) or third day ( for TBC1D3 knockdown ) post transfection , cells were treated with 1 \u00b5g/ml actinomycin D ( Sigma ) for 0 , 2 or 4 hr to inhibit gene transcription . Total RNA was extracted with Trizol ( Ambion , Holliston , MA ) and analyzed by RT-qPCR to detect the respective mRNA levels with following primers: human Cdh2 ( forward , 5\u2019 -ATGAAAGACCCATCCACG- 3\u2019 , reverse , 5\u2019-TCCTGCTCACCACCACTA-3\u2019 ) ; human Fos ( forward , 5\u2019-TCCGAAGGGAAAGGAATAA-3\u2019 , reverse , 5\u2019-TGAGCTGCCAGGATGAACT-3\u2019 ) ; human Hprt ( forward , 5\u2019-TGACCTGCTGGATTACAT-3\u2019 , reverse , 5\u2019-TTGGATTATACTGCCTGA-3\u2019 ) ; human TBC1D3 ( forward , 5\u2019-AGGTTCAGCAGAAGCGCCTCA-3\u2019 , reverse 5\u2019-GCCTGGATGCCGACGACCCTT-3\u2019 ) ; human Trnp1 ( forward , 5\u2019-GGAGGGGACGGCAGAGCAGA-3\u2019 , reverse 5\u2019-GGGTCGGGGTAGGAGTCAAGGT-3\u2019 ) . The vitality and transfection efficiency of ReNeuron cells were monitored under fluorescence microscopy during actinomycin D treatment and before RNA extraction . Postnatal mouse was perfused with phosphate buffered saline ( PBS ) followed with cold 4% paraformaldehyde ( PFA ) and prenatal mouse was perfused with cold 4% PFA directly , and then the brain was dissected out and post-fixed into cold 4% PFA in PBS at 4\u00b0C overnight . The fixed brain was dehydrated in 20% sucrose in PBS at 4\u00b0C and ultimately sectioned into 30 \u03bcm cryosections collected on glass slides , or 50 \u03bcm cryosections floating in PBS . The fetal human brain tissues were fixed in 4% PFA in PBS at 4\u00b0C for 3 days and dehydrated in 30% sucrose in PBS . After embedded and frozen at \u221280\u00b0C in O . C . T . compound ( Tissue-Tek , Hatfield , PA ) , the tissues were sectioned into 40 \u03bcm cryosections and stored at \u201380\u00b0C . For histological analysis , frozen sections were stained with 1% cresyl violet ( Sigma ) for Nissl staining . For immunohistochemistry , mouse brain slices were washed in PBS for 3 times and permeated in 0 . 3% ( v/v ) Triton X-100 in PBS for 30 min at room temperature ( RT ) . After above treatments , brain sections were incubated directly in a blocking solution ( 10% ( v/v ) donkey serum in PBS ) for 1 hr , followed by the incubation with the primary antibodies at 4\u00b0C overnight . Sections were then washed with PBS for 3 times followed by incubation with the appropriate secondary antibodies for 1\u20132 hr at room temperature ( RT ) . For the labeling of actin filaments , mouse brain slices were incubated with phalloidin-Alexa 647 ( 1:40 , Invitrogen ) in blocking solution with 0 . 1% Triton X-100 for 1\u20132 hr at RT . Fetal human brain cyrosections were subjected to heat-induced antigen retrieval in 10 mM sodium citrate ( pH = 6 . 0 ) for 10 min , then followed by above procedures .

All images were acquired on a Nikon A1R laser confocal microscope except that the labeled brain slices from time-lapse imaging were imaged on the Olympus FV10i-O with a 10x ( zoom x2 ) air objective lens . Fresh mice brains were mounted in O . C . T . compound ( Tissue-Tek ) and frozen at \u221280\u00b0C to be sectioned coronally ( 30 \u03bcm ) with a cryostat ( Leica , Germany , CM1950 ) . Cryosections were collected on superfrost plus microscope slides ( Fisher Scientific , Pittsburgh , PA ) . To generate template cDNA for RNA probe synthesis , mouse total RNA was extracted from cortical samples of E15 . 5 fetus by standard Trizol ( Life Technologies , Holliston , MA ) method and reverse transcribed with QuantScript RT kit using oligo ( dT ) 15 primers ( Tiangen ) . Cdh2 gene was amplified using primers: 5\u2019-CTGCCATGACTTTCTACGG-3\u2019 ( forward ) , 5\u2019-GGTTGATGGTCCAGTTTC-3\u2019 ( reverse ) .

PCR products of predicted band size were gel extracted and ligated into the pGEMT Vector System ( Promega , Madison , WI ) . Ligation products were transfected into DH5\u03b1 competent E . coli ( Tiangen ) and confirmed by sequencing . Digoxigenin labeled RNA probes for in situ hybridization were generated by amplifying target DNA fragments from pGEMT vector using T7 or SP6 RNA Polymerase ( Promega ) in the presence of DIG RNA Labeling Mix ( Roche , Switzerland ) . Synthesized anti-sense or sense RNA probes ( 1 ng/\u03bcl ) were applied in hybridization . The detailed procedure for in situ\u00a0hybridization was performed as described previously ( Wallace and Raff , 1999 ) . Images were collected with Nikon microscope ECLIPSE E600FN with an Optronics MicroFire digital camera . The detailed procedure for brain slice culture and time-lapse imaging was performed mainly as reported previously ( Wang et al . , 2011 ) with some modifications . E13 . 5 fetal mice brain cortices were electroporated with 0 . 6 \u03bcg/\u03bcl pCAGGS-TBC1D3-IRES-EGFP plasmids , or 1 \u03bcg/\u03bcl pCS2-Myc-TBC1D3 plus 0 . 5 \u03bcg/\u03bcl pCAG-H2BGFP-2A-tdTomato , with pCAGGS-IRES-EGFP or pCS2-MT as respective control . And at 24 hr post-electroporation , brain tissues were dissected out into ice-cold artificial cerebrospinal fluid ( ACSF ) containing 125 mM NaCl , 5 mM KCl , 1 . 25 mM NaH2PO4 , 1 mM MgSO4 , 2 mM CaCl2 , 25 mM NaHCO3 and 20 mM D- ( + ) -glucose ( all from Sigma ) ; pH 7 . 4 , 310 mOsm1-1 . Brains were embedded into 3% low melting temperature agarose in ACSF and sectioned at 300 \u03bcm thickness using a Leica VT1200S vibratome . Then brain slices were transferred and collected temporarily in ice-cold ACSF pre-oxygenated with 95% O2 , 5% CO2 . Rostral brain slices containing EGFP-positive cells were selected and transferred onto a slice culture insert ( Millicell , Millipore ) in a glass-bottom Petri dish ( Eppendorf , Germany ) with pre-warmed ( 37\u00b0C ) culture medium containing ( v/v ) 66% Eagle\u2019s basal medium , 25% Hanks balanced salt solution ( without calcium and magnesium ) , 5% FBS , 1% N2 supplement , 1% penicillin/streptomycin , 2 mM L-glutamine ( all from Gibco ) and 0 . 66% ( w/v ) D- ( + ) -glucose ( Sigma ) . Brain slices were maintained in a humidified incubator at 37\u00b0C with constant 5% CO2 supply for 2\u20133 hr before time-lapse imaging . All the time-lapse images in this study were collected in 20 min intervals and 14 hr duration by using Olympus laser confocal microscope FV10i-W with a Built-in incubator ( 37\u00b0C ) streamed with 5% CO2 , 95% O2 and an 10x ( zoom x2 ) air objective lens . For identifying the types of daughter cells divided from oRG-like cells , brain slices , after time-lapse imaging , were fixed immediately in cold 4% PFA overnight and then stained using the method mentioned above . Fresh embryonic brain samples obtained from voluntary abortions were treated mainly following the procedures described in a previous study ( Pollen et al . , 2015 ) . Briefly , samples were transferred and dissected in filtered ACSF containing antibiotic antimycotic ( Gibco ) equilibrated with 5% CO2 , 95% O2 , embedded in 4% low melting point agarose ( Invitrogen ) and 300 \u03bcm coronal sections were prepared in the presence of ACSF using vibrating microtome . Brain slices were transferred into slice culture inserts ( Millicell , Millipore ) in 6-well culture plates ( Corning , Corning , NY ) with culture media containing 66% Eagle\u2019s basal medium , 25% Hanks balanced salt solution , 5% fetal bovine serum , 1% N-2 supplement , 1% antimycotic , and 1% glutaMAX supplement ( all from Gibco ) , and equilibrated at 37\u00b0C in 95% O2 , 5% CO2 for 2\u20133 hr . Then the brain slices were subjected to electroporation with 1\u20133 \u00b5g indicated plasmids using a pair of home-made electrode ( five 50-ms 40 mV pulses with a 950-ms interval ) . After electroporation , slices were cultured in fresh medium in a 37\u00b0C incubator at 5% CO2 , 95% O2 for three days , followed by fixation in 4% PFA overnight , three washes with PBS , antigen retrieval ( Beyotime , China ) for 4 hr at RT , permeablization with 2% Triton-X 100 in PBS at 4\u00b0C overnight , and finally immunostaining with indicated antibodies , which were diluted in blocking buffer containing 10% donkey serum , 0 . 5% Triton-X 100 and 0 . 2% gelatin in PBS . Mice brains ( E15 . 5 ) were dissected out at 48 hr post-electroporation with pE/nestin-TBC1D3 or vehicle control , mixed with pCAG-YFP in a ratio of 3:1 , and placed in cold ACSF pre-oxygenated with 95% O2 , 5% CO2 . The YFP-positve cortical region was removed using an inverted fluorescence microscope ( Olympus , Japan , CKX41 ) and digested in 0 . 025% trypsin ( Sigma ) in ACSF for 20 min at 37\u00b0C and then centrifuged for 5 min at 1200 rpm . After removing the trypsin supernatant , tissue was re-suspended in 1 ml of ACSF containing 3% FBS ( Hyclone , Logan , UT ) and manually triturated by pipetting up and down approximately nine times . The suspension was passed through a 40-\u03bcm nylon cell strainer ( BD Falcon , San Jose , CA ) to obtain single-cell suspension and stored on ice before sorting . The YFP-positive cells were sorted into RNase-free tubers ( Axygen , Corning , NY ) on ice by using a MoFlo XDP flow cytometry ( Beckman Coulter , Brea , CA ) . The sorted cells ( 5 \u00d7\u00a0104\u20132\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0105 ) were centrifuged for 10 min at 300 g and the supernatant was removed . Total RNA from sorted YFP-positive cells ( 5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0104\u20132\u00a0\u00d7 105 ) was extracted immediately by using an RNeasy Micro Kit ( Qiagen , Germany ) and reverse transcribed with QuantScript RT kit using oligo ( dT ) 15 primers ( Tiangen ) . Real-time PCR was performed by using the Agilent Mx3000P qPCR system with the SYBR Premix Ex Taq II ( Takara ) . Quantification was performed by the delta cycle time method , with mouse GAPDH used for normalization . The specific primers are: GAPDH , 5\u2019-AGAGTGTTTCCTCGTCCCG-3\u2019 ( forward ) , 5\u2019-CCGTTGAATTTGCCGTGA-3\u2019 ( reverse ) ; Cdh2 , 5\u2019-CCCCAAGTCCAACATTTC-3\u2019 ( forward ) , 5\u2019-CGCCGTTTCATCCATACC-3\u2019 ( reverse ) ; Numb , 5\u2019-TAGAGCGTAAACAGAAGCG-3\u2019 ( forward ) , 5\u2019-CACTGATGGACCAACAACT-3\u2019 ( reverse ) ; Hes1 , 5\u2019-TGACGGCCAATTTGCCTTTC-3\u2019 ( forward ) , 5\u2019-TTCCGCCACGGTCTCCACA-3\u2019 ( reverse ) ; Hes5 , 5\u2019-GCACCAGCCCAACTCCAA-3\u2019 ( forward ) , 5\u2019-TCAGGAACTGTACCGCCTCC-3\u2019 ( reverse ) ; Trnp1 , 5\u2019-CCCAGGAAGGGACGGCAGAA-3\u2019 ( forward ) , 5\u2019-CCTCGGGTAAGGGCGGTGA-3\u2019 ( reverse ) . Sequential 5-bromo-2\u2019-deoxyuridine/5-ethynyl-2\u2019-deoxyuridine ( BrdU/EdU ) double labeling was performed mainly as previously described with some modifications ( Insolera et al . , 2014 ) . In utero electroporation was conducted at E13 . 5 according to the method described above . The pregnant female mouse was injected intraperitoneally ( i . p . ) with 50 mg/kg BrdU ( Sigma ) at E14 . 5 and 100 \u03bcg EdU ( Life Technologies ) at E15 . 5 . After 2 hr , fetal mice brains were dissected and fixed immediately in cold 4% PFA in PBS at 4\u00b0C overnight , followed by dehydration in 20% sucrose in PBS at 4\u00b0C . For transgenic mice , BrdU and EdU were sequentially injected at E13 . 5 and E16 . 5 , respectively . Frozen sections ( 50 \u03bcm ) were collected in PBS as described above . BrdU staining was performed using the manufacturer\u2019s protocol ( Abcam ) . In brief , brain sections were successively treated with 1 M HCl for 10 min on ice , 2 M HCl for 10 min at RT and another 20 min at 37\u00b0C to denature the DNA . Immediately after the acid incubations , sections were transferred into 0 . 1 M borate buffer , pH 9 . 0 , for 10 min of neutralization at RT . After washes with PBS , brain sections were treated with 0 . 3% Triton X-100 in PBS for 30 min followed by incubation in 10% donkey serum in PBS for 1 hr at RT , followed by incubation with primary antibodies ( mouse anti-BrdU , Life Technologies B35128 , 1:200; chicken anti-GFP , Aves Lab #GFP-1020 , 1:500 ) at 4\u00b0C overnight , washes and incubation with the appropriate secondary antibodies for 1\u20132 hr at RT . EdU staining was performed using a Click-iT Plus EdU Imaging Kit ( Life Technologies C10640 ) immediately after the incubation of secondary antibodies . The detailed procedure for producing TBC1D3-transgenic mice was performed mainly as described previously ( Behringer et al . , 2013 ) . Briefly , to obtain nestin-TBC1D3 fragments , pE/nestin-TBC1D3 plasmids were digested with DraIII and MfeI ( New England BioLabs , Ipswitch , MA ) . The target fragments were purified directly from the gel using a Whatman ( Pittsburgh , PA ) S&S ELUTRAP Electro-Separation System and diluted into 3 ng/\u03bcl in injection buffer for microinjection . Then the nestin-TBC1D3 fragments were injected into the pronucleus of C57BL/6 mouse zygotes and the injected embryos were implanted into the oviducts of day 1 pseudopregnant foster females ( ICR ) . The TBC1D3-transgenic mice were identified by PCR using tail genomic DNA with specific primers: 5\u2019- CCCACAACTCCGATTACTCAA -3\u2019 ( forward , P1 ) , 5\u2019 -CGCCTGTTCGCCTTCTAC -3\u2019 ( reverse , P2 ) . The analysis and maintenance for TBC1D3-transgenic mouse was performed in the background of C57BL/6 . Mouse brains were dissected out in cold PBS and fixed in cold 4% PFA in PBS at 4\u00b0C overnight , followed by removal of the meninges that covers the cortical surface . The DiI crystals ( Life Technologies ) were dissolved in 100% ethanol to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml in 1 ml final volume . Then each brain sample was transferred to 1 ml fresh 4% PFA in PBS added with 30 \u03bcl of 1 mg/ml DiI solution and incubated at 37\u00b0C for another 24 hr . After DiI labeling , brains were washed with PBS , sectioned on the vibratome ( Leica VT1200S ) into 100 \u03bcm slices , and stained with DAPI before mounting . All images were processed by ImageJ or Fiji software . For each experiment with mice or cells , at least 3 biological replicates were performed . Biological replicates are defined as independent experiments in cells or the same experiment with different mouse embryos . For all experiments , statistical tests were performed using SigmaStat software: one way ANOVA followed by Student-Newman-Keuls test for multiple comparisons , or one way ANOVA on Ranks followed with Dunn\u2019s test for multiple comparisons for raw data without passing normality test or equal variance test , except for Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2B and D where two-way ANOVA followed with Student-Newman-Keuls test for multiple comparisons was used .

{"lay_summary": "Plant diseases cause devastating crop losses around the world and threaten the food supply of millions of people . Over time , plants have developed various mechanisms for fighting off infections caused by pests and other pathogens such as viruses and bacteria . When plants become infected they kick their immune system into action by rapidly switching on and off certain genes . They do this by activating the protein NPR1 which regulates the plant\u2019s immune genes . NPR1 is essential for fighting off infections and plants that do not have this protein are highly susceptible to disease . Peculiarly , once the plant has detected an infection it builds resistance by destroying the NPR1 protein . A previous study suggested that plants do this to replace old \u2018inactive\u2019 NPR1 with newer versions that can activate the genes needed to stop the disease developing . This process , however , requires a lot of energy that could be re-directed to other aspects of the immune response . Now , Skelly et al . \u2013 including one of the researchers involved in the previous study \u2013 have explored whether there may be other reasons for why plants destroy the NPR1 protein . Plant cells target NPR1 for destruction by repeatedly tagging it with molecules called ubiquitin to form ubiquitin chains . The length of these chains determines whether a protein is stable and ready for action , or whether it is ready to be destroyed . In experiments with a commonly studied plant known as Arabidopsis thaliana , Skelly et al . found that the length of ubiquitin chains attached to the NPR1 protein could fine-tune its level of activity: short ubiquitin chains activate NPR1 , while longer chains lead to its destruction and shut down the protein . This suggests that the steps leading to the destruction of NPR1 regulate the immune genes needed to fight off disease . This work has uncovered important new components of how plants defend themselves from infection . If these findings translate to crop plants they could inform future agricultural strategies for enhancing the plant\u2019s own defences to increase crop yields , which would provide more food for a rapidly growing population .", "article": "Activation of systemic acquired resistance in plants is associated with transcriptome reprogramming induced by the unstable coactivator NPR1 . Immune-induced ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of NPR1 are thought to facilitate continuous delivery of active NPR1 to target promoters , thereby maximising gene expression . Because of this potentially costly sacrificial process , we investigated if ubiquitination of NPR1 plays transcriptional roles prior to its proteasomal turnover . Here we show ubiquitination of NPR1 is a progressive event in which initial modification by a Cullin-RING E3 ligase promotes its chromatin association and expression of target genes . Only when polyubiquitination of NPR1 is enhanced by the E4 ligase , UBE4 , it is targeted for proteasomal degradation . Conversely , ubiquitin ligase activities are opposed by UBP6/7 , two proteasome-associated deubiquitinases that enhance NPR1 longevity . Thus , immune-induced transcriptome reprogramming requires sequential actions of E3 and E4 ligases balanced by opposing deubiquitinases that fine-tune activity of NPR1 without strict requirement for its sacrificial turnover . \n Immune responses must be tightly controlled to provide appropriate , efficient and timely resistance to pathogenic threats . A major hallmark of eukaryotic immune responses is dramatic reprogramming of the transcriptome to prioritise defences over other cellular functions . In plants transcriptional reprogramming is largely orchestrated by the immune hormone salicylic acid ( SA ) that accumulates upon recognition of biotrophic pathogens . SA not only induces resistance in infected local tissues , it is also required for establishment of systemic acquired resistance ( SAR ) , a form of induced resistance with broad-spectrum effectiveness that is long-lasting and protects the entire plant from future pathogen attack ( Spoel and Dong , 2012 ) . Establishment of SAR and associated transcriptome reprogramming are mediated by the transcriptional coactivator NPR1 ( nonexpressor of pathogenesis-related ( PR ) genes 1 ) . The majority of SA-induced genes are NPR1 dependent , indicating NPR1 is a master regulator of plant immunity ( Wang et al . , 2006 ) . Consequently , loss of NPR1 function results in severely immune-compromised plants unable to activate SAR . Since NPR1 exerts its activity in the nucleus ( Kinkema et al . , 2000 ) , controlling its nuclear entry provides a means to prevent spurious activation of immune responses . Indeed , in resting cells NPR1 is sequestered in the cytoplasm as a large redox-sensitive oligomer that is formed by intermolecular disulphide linkages between conserved cysteine residues ( Mou et al . , 2003 ) . NPR1 monomers that escape oligomerization and enter the nucleus are ubiquitinated by a Cullin-RING Ligase 3 ( CRL3 ) , a modular E3 ubiquitin ligase , resulting in their degradation by the 26S proteasome ( Spoel et al . , 2009 ) . Importantly , constitutive clearance of NPR1 from nuclei of resting cells by concerted action of CRL3 and the proteasome is necessary to prevent untimely activation of its target genes and associated autoimmunity . Upon activation of SAR , NPR1 is subject to an array of post-translational modifications . A combination of alterations in redox-based modifications , phosphorylation and SUMOylation of NPR1 result in the formation of a transactivation complex that induces the transcription of immune-responsive target genes ( Skelly et al . , 2016; Withers and Dong , 2016 ) . Subsequent to these post-translational control points , NPR1 becomes phosphorylated at Ser11 and Ser15 , which surprisingly results in recruitment of CRL3 followed by its degradation ( Spoel et al . , 2009 ) . Pharmacological inhibition of the proteasome , genetic mutation of CRL3 , and mutation of Ser11/15 all stabilised NPR1 protein , yet impaired the expression of SA-induced NPR1 target genes ( Spoel et al . , 2009 ) . These findings indicate that paradoxically , ubiquitination and degradation of NPR1 are required for the full expression of its target genes . We previously proposed a proteolysis-coupled transcription model in which activation of target gene transcription results in NPR1 being marked as \u2018spent\u2019 by Ser11/15 phosphorylation ( Spoel et al . , 2009 ) . SUMOylation of NPR1 was required for Ser11/15 phosphorylation and facilitates its interaction with other transcriptional activators ( Saleh et al . , 2015 ) , suggesting that NPR1 becomes inactivated only after it has initiated gene transcription . Removal of inactive NPR1 from target promoters may be necessary to allow binding of new active NPR1 protein that can reinitiate transcription , thereby correlating the rate of NPR1 turnover to the level of target gene expression ( Spoel et al . , 2009 ) . This type of transcriptional control by unstable ( co ) activators has also been reported in other eukaryotes , including for key transcriptional regulators such as the nutrient sensor GCN4 in yeast and the estrogen receptor ER\u03b1 as well as oncogenic cMyc and SRC-3 activators in humans ( Kim et al . , 2003; Lipford et al . , 2005; M\u00e9tivier et al . , 2003; Reid et al . , 2003; von der Lehr et al . , 2003; Wu et al . , 2007 ) . This suggests that the use of unstable transcriptional ( co ) activators may be an evolutionary conserved mechanism for fine-tuning gene expression ( Geng et al . , 2012; Kodadek et al . , 2006 ) . While transcription-coupled degradation of unstable ( co ) activators is an attractive model for controlling transcriptional outputs in eukaryotes , it is potentially also a costly sacrificial process . Therefore we explored the alternative possibility that prior to degradation , ubiquitination itself might act as a transcriptional signal . As chains of four or more ubiquitin molecules are thought to be necessary for recruitment of most substrates to the proteasome ( Thrower et al . , 2000 ) , it is plausible that processive ubiquitination could provide a window of opportunity for NPR1 to activate its target genes . In this study we demonstrate that the transcriptional activity of NPR1 is controlled by several ubiquitin chain modifying enzymes . Both stepwise ubiquitin chain extension and trimming activities contribute to the regulation of NPR1 target genes and establishment of plant immunity . Our findings imply that in eukaryotes transcriptional outputs of unstable ( co ) activators may not be fine-tuned by their proteasomal turnover per se but rather by conjugated ubiquitin chains of dynamic variable length . \n To examine if stepwise ubiquitination of NPR1 plays a role in plant immune responses we examined a potential role for E4 ligases . Unlike E3 ligases , the E4 class do not contribute towards initial ubiquitination of substrates but rather extend pre-existing ubiquitin chains ( Hoppe , 2005; Koegl et al . , 1999 ) . In Arabidopsis the E4 ligase UBE4/MUSE3 has been implicated in the degradation of NLR ( nucleotide binding and leucine-rich repeat ) immune receptors . Mutant ube4/muse3 plants exhibited enhanced disease resistance but this phenotype could only be explained in part by the increased stability of an NLR receptor ( Huang et al . , 2014 ) . Therefore we investigated if UBE4 is involved in downstream NPR1-dependent immune signalling by acquiring a loss-of-function T-DNA insertion mutant ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . Like mutants in CRL3 ligase that fail to degrade NPR1 ( Spoel et al . , 2009 ) , adult ube4 plants displayed enhanced expression of immune genes in absence of pathogen challenge ( Figure 1A ) . In agreement with this , when the potential for enhanced disease resistance was examined by using a high inoculum of Psm ES4326 , adult ube4 mutants showed autoimmunity ( Figure 1B ) . To establish if these phenotypes were dependent on SA signalling , ube4 mutant plants were crossed with SA-deficient ics1 mutants ( Wildermuth et al . , 2001 ) . The constitutive immune gene expression observed in ube4 was abolished in ube4 ics1 double mutant plants ( Figure 1C ) . Furthermore , a low inoculum dosage of Psm ES4326 that does not cause disease in wild-type ( WT ) and mutant ube4 plants , did result in bacterial proliferation in mutant ics1 plants . In agreement with the gene expression data , enhanced susceptibility was maintained in ube4 ics1 double mutants ( Figure 1D ) , indicating the autoimmune phenotype of adult ube4 plants is completely dependent on SA . Because SA-dependent immunity is largely regulated by the transcription coactivator NPR1 ( Cao et al . , 1997 ) , we crossed ube4 with npr1-1 mutant plants . Constitutive immune gene expression in ube4 plants was abolished in ube4 npr1 plants ( Figure 1E ) and this double mutant was equally susceptible to a low Psm ES4326 inoculum as npr1 single mutants ( Figure 1F ) . Collectively , these data suggest that in unchallenged plants UBE4 suppresses the expression of SA-mediated NPR1 target genes and prevents autoimmunity , conceivably by altering the stability of upstream NLR immune receptors as well as the downstream NPR1 coactivator . Because ube4 mutant phenotypes resemble those of mutants in CRL3 ligase ( Spoel et al . , 2009 ) , we investigated if UBE4 also controls NPR1 stability in the nucleus . Expression of a YFP-UBE4 fusion protein in Arabidopsis protoplasts confirmed it is indeed partly localised to the nucleus ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A ) . We used the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide to examine if UBE4 controls the stability of SA-induced NPR1 . Both SA-induced constitutively expressed NPR1-GFP ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B ) ( Kinkema et al . , 2000 ) and endogenous NPR1 from WT plants were degraded within a few hours after exposure to cycloheximide ( Figure 2A and B ) . By contrast , both proteins were considerably more stable in the ube4 mutant genetic background . These findings were further confirmed by quantifying the amount of NPR1-GFP or endogenous NPR1 protein remaining after exposure to cycloheximide ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C and D ) . Stabilisation of endogenous NPR1 also occurred in the previously described muse3 mutant allele of UBE4 ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1E ) ( Huang et al . , 2014 ) . Taken together these results indicate that UBE4 promotes NPR1 degradation . Recruitment of NPR1 to CRL3 for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation requires phosphorylation at residues Ser11 and Ser15 ( Spoel et al . , 2009 ) . Therefore we examined if ube4 mutants were impaired in NPR1 Ser11/15 phosphorylation . However , Ser11/15 phosphorylation of NPR1-GFP was unaffected by the ube4 mutation ( Figure 2C ) , indicating UBE4 mediates NPR1 turnover downstream of CRL3-mediated ubiquitination . We then investigated if UBE4 is involved in polyubiquitination of NPR1 . Pulldown of polyubiquitinated proteins using tandem-repeated ubiquitin-binding entities ( TUBE ) ( Hjerpe et al . , 2009 ) followed by detection of NPR1-GFP , revealed that SA stimulated polyubiquitination of NPR1-GFP ( Figure 2D ) . By contrast , SA-induced polyubiquitination of NPR1-GFP was compromised in ube4 mutants ( Figure 2D ) , but ubiquitinated NPR1 was still detected at high-molecular weight . Therefore we sought to distinguish if in ube4 mutants , NPR1 was modified by long ubiquitin chains or multiple shorter chains , both of which yield high-molecular weights on SDS-PAGE . Thus , we performed pull down experiments with recombinant S5a ubiquitin interacting motifs ( S5aUIM ) that preferentially bind chains of four or more ubiquitin molecules ( Deveraux et al . , 1994; Young et al . , 1998 ) . Compared to plants carrying wild-type UBE4 alleles , the amount of SA-induced polyubiquitinated NPR1-GFP pulled down with recombinant S5aUIM was strikingly lower in ube4 mutants ( Figure 2E ) , indicating that UBE4 promotes formation of long ubiquitin chains on NPR1 leading to its proteasomal degradation . To determine if UBE4 may act directly on NPR1 , we assessed the ability of UBE4 to physically interact with ubiquitinated NPR1 . We isolated ubiquitinated NPR1-GFP from SA and MG132-treated ube4 mutants and subsequently incubated with recombinant FLAG-UBE4 . As shown in Figure 2F , NPR1-GFP specifically pulled down FLAG-UBE4 , indicating that UBE4 physically binds to polyubiquitinated NPR1 to facilitate ubiquitin chain extension . Because UBE4 enhanced polyubiquitination of NPR1 and controlled its stability ( Figure 2 ) , we investigated if similar to CRL3 ( Spoel et al . , 2009 ) , it also promotes transcriptional activity of NPR1 . In stark contrast to cul3a cul3b mutants that were compromised in SA-induced expression of NPR1 target genes , plants carrying two different ube4 mutant alleles exhibited elevated expression levels that were much higher than in WT ( Figure 3A and B , Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A ) . To explore the effect of UBE4 on the NPR1-dependent transcriptome , we performed RNA Seq on SA-treated WT , ube4 and npr1 plants . Among 2612 genes whose expression changed by\u00a0\u22652 fold in response to SA in WT or ube4 mutants , 75% were stringently dependent on NPR1 ( i . e . \u22651 . 5 fold difference compared to npr1 ) ( Figure 3\u2014source data 1 ) . We separated these genes into two categories: ( 1 ) genes that were regulated by SA in both WT and mutant ube4 plants , and ( 2 ) genes that did not make the\u00a0\u22652 fold change cut-off in WT but were highly regulated by SA in ube4 mutants . The majority of SA-induced genes in category 1 , including PR1 and WRKY marker genes , received a boost in expression when UBE4 was knocked out ( Figure 3C ) . This positive effect was even clearer for category two genes ( Figure 3C and D ) . Similarly , genes suppressed by SA treatment displayed further downregulation in ube4 mutants compared to WT ( Figure 3C ) . By contrast , SA-regulated genes that were not dependent on NPR1 behaved similarly in WT and mutant ube4 plants ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B ) , suggesting UBE4 exerts its effects predominantly through NPR1 . Together these data suggest that in absence of UBE4-mediated long-chain polyubiquitination , NPR1 remains in a highly active transcriptional state . To understand the opposing effects of CRL3 and UBE4 on transcriptional activity of NPR1 , we examined endogenous NPR1 protein levels . Compared to WT plants , SA-induced NPR1 accumulated to elevated levels in both cul3a/b and ube4 mutants ( Figure 3E ) . Thus , NPR1 protein levels cannot explain differences in transcriptional output of NPR1 . We then examined if changes in polyubiquitin chain length regulate NPR1 association with its target promoters . To that end we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments on plants that constitutively expressed NPR1-GFP , thereby eliminating genotype-dependent differences in NPR1 protein level . Coinciding with elevated PR1 gene expression , at 8 hr after SA treatment more NPR1-GFP was bound to the PR1 promoter in ube4 mutants compared to plants carrying wild-type UBE4 alleles ( Figure 3F ) . This indicates that in absence of long polyubiquitin chains , early occupancy by transcriptionally competent NPR1 is increased at target promoters . We also examined a later time point after SA treatment ( 24 hr ) and found that NPR1-GFP was still associated with the PR1 promoter in plants expressing wild-type UBE4 , but not in ube4 mutants ( Figure 3G ) . Nonetheless , PR1 gene expression remained at elevated levels in these mutants ( Figure 3G ) , implying that in absence of long-chain polyubiquitination NPR1 strongly switches on target genes without the need for long-term residency at their promoters . To investigate if CRL3 and UBE4 act independently or in tandem , we crossed ube4 single with cul3a cul3b double mutants and analysed the expression of NPR1 target genes in the resulting triple mutant . Strikingly , cul3a cul3b ube4 mutants showed severe developmental defects , including stunted growth and complete sterility ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C and D ) . Very few viable homozygous plants were recovered , perhaps suggesting these two ligases work together and share substrates . Nonetheless we were able to select just enough plants to examine the behaviour of NPR1 target genes . In cul3a cul3b ube4 mutants the SA-induced expression of several genes , including PR genes , was impaired to a similar extend as in cul3a cul3b double mutants , indicating that elevated gene expression observed in ube4 plants is dependent on CRL3 ( Figure 3H and I ) . However , a subset of NPR1 target genes ( i . e . WRKY18 , WRKY38 , WRKY62 ) were dramatically upregulated in cul3a cul3b ube4 mutants to a level higher than in any of the other genotypes . This suggests that in absence of CRL3 and UBE4 , these genes were activated through another pathway or were highly responsive to elevated homeostatic levels of NPR1 protein and may therefore not be suitable readouts for this particular epistatic analysis ( Figure 3I ) . Regardless of this specific , our broader findings suggest that CRL3 and UBE4 function sequentially in the stepwise addition or extension of ubiquitin chains on NPR1 but with opposing effects on its transcriptional activity . We then examined if in ube4 mutants NPR1 lingered in a highly transcriptional active state that does not require proteasome-mediated turnover . To negate any feedback effects of loss of UBE4 activity on endogenous NPR1 expression , seedlings constitutively expressing NPR1-GFP were treated with SA plus a range of MG132 concentrations . SA-induced PR1 and WRKY gene expression was inhibited by increasing concentrations of MG132 in NPR1-GFP ( in npr1 ) plants ( Figure 3J and Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1E ) . By contrast , the SA-induced expression of these NPR1 target genes was largely unresponsive to MG132 in ube4 mutants , especially at lower concentrations . Thus , loss of UBE4 largely uncoupled NPR1 target gene expression from proteasome activity , demonstrating the importance of progressive ubiquitination for NPR1 activity . In summary , our findings indicate that initial CRL3-mediated ubiquitination is required for NPR1 to attain its full transcriptional activity , while the stepwise formation of long ubiquitin chains mediated by UBE4 inactivates NPR1 and promotes its degradation by the proteasome . Trimming or removal of ubiquitin chains is performed by deubiquitinases ( DUBs ) and may provide another layer of regulation of NPR1 activity . The Arabidopsis genome is predicted to encode for at least 65 DUBs ( Vierstra , 2009; Yang et al . , 2007 ) with high likelihood of redundancy among gene families . Therefore identifying candidate genes that potentially regulate NPR1 by genetically screening mutant collections was not feasible . Instead , we used a range of pharmacological broad-spectrum and selective DUB inhibitors and assessed their effect on SA-induced gene expression . The broad-spectrum inhibitors PR-619 ( Altun et al . , 2011 ) and NSC632839 ( Aleo et al . , 2006 ) strongly impaired SA-induced gene expression across all NPR1 target genes tested ( Figure 4A ) , suggesting that DUB activity is required for their optimal expression . Furthermore , while treatment with PR-619 or NSC632839 did not affect SA-induced transcription of the NPR1 gene , it depleted NPR1 protein levels ( Figure 4B ) . Thus , DUB activity may not only be required for NPR1-dependent gene expression but also for increasing NPR1 stability . Next we tested more selective inhibitors that more specifically target one or a few DUBs . First we treated WT seedlings with various DUB inhibitors and compared the cellular levels of global ubiquitin conjugates with control- , and MG132-treated seedlings . While NSC632839 and MG132 treatments dramatically enhanced accumulation of ubiquitin conjugates , especially in combination with SA treatment , all other inhibitors had little effect on cellular ubiquitination levels ( Figure 4C ) . We then examined the effect of these DUB inhibitors on SA-induced gene expression . All inhibitors strongly suppressed SA-induced expression of NPR1 target genes ( Figure 4D ) . Furthermore , most inhibitors were effective at low micromolar concentrations and suppressed NPR1 target genes in a dose-dependent manner ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . Collectively these data provide a first indication that DUB activity may be crucial for NPR1 stability and efficient activation of SA-induced NPR1 target genes . The more selective inhibitors used in experiments described above have been shown to target DUBs in mammalian cells ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A ) ( Altun et al . , 2011; Kapuria et al . , 2010; Liu et al . , 2003 ) . To find potential homologues we used the sequences of these mammalian DUBs to search the Arabidopsis genome using BLASTp . The identified Arabidopsis DUBs included members of the ubiquitin-specific protease ( UBP ) and ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase ( UCH ) multi-gene families ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A ) . We then searched mutant collections to identify T-DNA knockouts for each of these DUBs . UBP14 knockouts are lethal in Arabidopsis ( Doelling et al . , 2001 ) , while no T-DNA insertions were identified for either UCH1 or UCH2 in mutant collections of the Col-0 genetic background . Therefore we did not pursue these DUBs further . The DUB inhibitor TCID is thought to target mammalian UCH-L3 for which we identified a single Arabidopsis homologue , UCH3 . We acquired a T-DNA insertion line that displayed complete knockout of UCH3 expression ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B ) and analysed SA-induced NPR1 target gene expression . Figure 5A shows that SA-induced PR1 and WRKY gene expression was generally comparable between uch3 and WT plants , indicating UCH3 is unlikely to play a major role . Next we identified UBP12 and UBP13 as potential plant targets of both WP1130 and P22077 inhibitors ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A ) . Previous research has suggested a role for these two proteins in plant immunity , as ubp12 ubp13 double knockdown RNAi plants exhibited elevated expression of PR1 and increased resistance to the virulent pathogen P . syringae pv . tomato ( Ewan et al . , 2011 ) . Single knockout mutants of UBP12 and UBP13 have no observable phenotype and double knockouts are seedling lethal ( Cui et al . , 2013; Ewan et al . , 2011 ) . However we acquired the ubp12-2w allele , previously described as a weak ubp12 ubp13 double mutant ( Cui et al . , 2013 ) , and analysed this mutant for SA-induced gene expression . Similar to a previous report ( Ewan et al . , 2011 ) , we observed elevated PR1 expression in ubp12-2w plants but other NPR1 target genes were activated to a slightly lesser extent as in WT ( Figure 5B ) . This phenotype does not explain the suppressive effects we observed with pharmacological DUB inhibitors . Finally , we acquired T-DNA knockout lines for the mammalian USP14 homologues , UBP6 and UPB7 that are potentially targeted by the WP1130 inhibitor ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A and C ) . SA-induced expression of PR1 was slightly lower in these mutants but WRKY gene expression was largely comparable to WT plants ( Figure 5C ) . Since UBP6 and UBP7 are close homologues ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2A and B ) , we generated ubp6 ubp7 double knockout mutants ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1C ) that were viable and showed no observable developmental phenotypes . However , ubp6 ubp7 mutants were impaired in activation of SA-induced gene expression ( Figure 5D ) . This indicates that UBP6 and UBP7 are functionally redundant and required for NPR1 target gene expression . Human USP14 and its yeast homologue Ubp6 have both been shown to associate with the 26S proteasome , which is necessary for their activity ( Borodovsky et al . , 2001; Leggett et al . , 2002 ) . We tested if this is also the case for Arabidopsis UBP6 by constitutively expressing FLAG-tagged UBP6 in the ubp6 ubp7 double mutant background followed by co-immunoprecipitation experiments . The proteasomal subunits S5a and RPN6 both co-immunoprecipitated with FLAG-tagged UBP6 ( Figure 6A ) , indicating UBP6 is also a proteasome-associated DUB in plants . Next we examined if UBP6 exhibits typical DUB activity . We produced recombinant T7-tagged UBP6 and incubated it with HA-tagged ubiquitin vinyl sulfone ( HA-UbVS ) , an ubiquitin mimic that cannot be hydrolysed upon irreversible binding to DUB active sites ( Borodovsky et al . , 2001 ) . HA-UbVS readily labelled T7-UBP6 but only upon addition of 26S proteasomes ( Figure 6B ) , indicating UBP6 has proteasome-activated DUB activity . Moreover , addition of WP1130 inhibitor completely blocked HA-UbVS labelling ( Figure 6B ) , illustrating the effectiveness of this inhibitor on Arabidopsis UBP6 . To examine if UBP6 can cleave ubiquitin chains we incubated recombinant UBP6 with free ubiquitin chains or with di-ubiquitin of different linkage types and compared it to activity of recombinant human USP14 . Similar to human USP14 , Arabidopsis UBP6 displayed very little deubiquitination activity on free ubiquitin chains or di-ubiquitin of K48 and K63 linkage types ( Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A\u20131C ) . Only wild-type UBP6 but not UBP6 ( C113S ) in which the catalytic cysteine residue was mutated , was weakly capable of trimming K63-linked chains in presence of 26S proteasomes , although this activity required very long incubation times ( Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1B ) . These findings mirror the poor in vitro activity of human USP14 on free ubiquitin chains ( Lee et al . , 2016 ) . Instead , human USP14 deubiquitinates anchored ubiquitin chains of various linkage types , including K48 linkages that target proteins for proteasome-mediated degradation ( Lee et al . , 2016 ) . Therefore we proceeded to investigate if UBP6 activity cleaves ubiquitin chains anchored to NPR1 . Indeed , incubation of purified polyubiquitinated NPR1-GFP with recombinant UBP6 and 26S proteasomes led to the release of ubiquitin conjugates of approximately hexa-ubiquitin chain length ( Figure 6C ) . This release of ubiquitin conjugates was dependent on SA treatment , suggesting that UBP6 counteracts SA-induced polyubiquitination of NPR1 ( Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1D ) . Together , these results demonstrate that UBP6 is an active DUB capable of removing ubiquitin chains en bloc from NPR1 . So what is the effect of UBP6- and UBP7-mediated deubiquitination on NPR1 function ? We found that treatment of NPR1-GFP ( in npr1 ) seedlings with WP1130 inhibitor increased the levels of SA-induced polyubiquitinated NPR1-GFP while reducing the unmodified amount of this protein ( Figure 6D ) . This suggests that UBP6 and UBP7 activities are required for deubiquitination of SA-induced NPR1-GFP , thereby rescuing it from degradation . To further examine this possibility , we analysed the stability of endogenous NPR1 protein in SA-treated ubp6 ubp7 double mutants . CHX chase experiments revealed that compared to WT plants , NPR1 was destabilised in ubp6 ubp7 mutants ( Figure 6E ) . Accordingly , expression of FLAG-tagged UBP6 in the ubp6/7 mutant background restored NPR1 stability ( Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1E ) . These results demonstrate that UBP6 and UBP7 serve to stabilise NPR1 by removing ubiquitin chains that signal for its proteasome-mediated degradation . Given the importance of progressive ubiquitination for the transcriptional activity of NPR1 , we explored how UBP6- and UBP7-mediated deubiquitination might affect NPR1 coactivator function . Because UBP6 and UBP7 were required for NPR1-dependent PR1 gene expression ( Figure 5D ) , we questioned if NPR1 was still associated with the PR1 promoter in absence of UBP6 and UBP7 activities . Surprisingly , ChIP experiments showed that SA-induced association of NPR1-GFP with the PR1 promoter was strongly enhanced in presence of WP1130 inhibitor ( Figure 6F ) . This suggests that UBP6 and UBP7 prevent the build-up of long polyubiquitin chains that block the transcriptional activity of NPR1 . It also implies that similar to their yeast homologue , UBP6 and UBP7 exhibit proteasome inhibitory activity ( Hanna et al . , 2006 ) . This activity is thought to delay degradation of proteasome substrates , thereby creating a window of opportunity for DUBs to deubiquitinate substrates and pardon them from proteolysis . Importantly , proteasome inhibitory activity does not require the catalytic active site ( Hanna et al . , 2006 ) . Thus , to investigate how deubiquitination and proteasome inhibitory activities of UBP6 contribute to the regulation of NPR1 coactivator activity , we expressed FLAG-tagged wild-type UBP6 ( FLAG-UBP6 ) and catalytically inactive UBP6 ( C113S ) ( FLAG-UBP6m ) in ubp6 ubp7 double mutants . While ubp6 ubp7 mutants were compromised in SA-induced activation of all NPR1 target genes tested , expression of FLAG-UBP6 fully restored SA-responsiveness ( Figure 6G ) . By contrast , FLAG-UBP6m restored SA-induced expression of only a subset , but not all NPR1 target genes . A distinction was observed between WRKY and PR genes , with the former requiring catalytic DUB activity of UBP6 while the latter did not ( Figure 6G ) . These data indicate that catalytic and non-catalytic activities of UBP6 regulate distinct NPR1-dependent gene sets . Finally we examined what the relevance is of UBP6- and UBP7-regulated transcriptional activity of NPR1 in context of plant immunity . We first treated plants with or without SA before challenge inoculation with virulent Psm ES4326 . SA treatment induced resistance in WT plants but did not block bacterial propagation in ubp6/7 plants ( Figure 6H ) . Collectively , these data clearly demonstrate that UBP6 and UBP7 are required for NPR1 coactivator activity and associated development of SA-dependent immunity . \n The ubiquitin-mediated proteasome system plays vital roles in the regulation of eukaryotic gene expression , in large part by controlling the abundance of transcriptional regulators . Paradoxically , proteasome-dependent instability of selected potent eukaryotic transcriptional activators is necessary for the expression of their target genes . It is thought that their transcription-coupled degradation ensures the target promoter is continuously supplied with fresh activators that reinitiate transcription , thereby maximising gene expression ( Geng et al . , 2012; Kodadek et al . , 2006 ) . However , this sacrificial process is energy-expensive ( Collins and Goldberg , 2017; Peth et al . , 2013 ) , raising a dilemma of why such mechanisms evolved to regulate transcriptional activators . Our study on the immune coactivator NPR1 , however , indicates that ubiquitin chain extension and trimming activities can fine-tune transcriptional outputs of unstable eukaryotic activators without strict requirement for sacrificial turnover . We discovered that ubiquitination of NPR1 is a stepwise event , requiring the actions of CRL3 and the E4 ligase UBE4 . In resting cells , CRL3-mediated turnover of NPR1 is important for preventing autoimmunity in absence of pathogen threat ( Spoel et al . , 2009 ) . The NPR1-dependent autoimmune phenotype of ube4 mutants is reminiscent of that observed in cul3a cul3b mutants ( Figure 1 ) ( Spoel et al . , 2009 ) , suggesting that in addition to CRL3 ligase , UBE4 is required to clear NPR1 from the nucleus and prevent untimely activation of immunity . In presence of SA , however , CRL3-mediated ubiquitination induced NPR1 coactivator activity , whereas formation of polyubiquitin chains by UBE4 blocked its activity and ultimately led to proteasome-mediated turnover ( Figures 2 and 3 ) . Rather than initiating substrate ubiquitination , E4 ligases are thought to extend existing ubiquitin chains ( Crosas et al . , 2006; Koegl et al . , 1999 ) , thereby determining substrate commitment to proteasome-mediated degradation and contributing to proteasome processivity ( Aviram and Kornitzer , 2010; Koegl et al . , 1999 ) . Functionally these enzymes are emerging as important players in limiting the activity of NLR immune receptors as well as potent eukaryotic transcriptional regulators . Arabidopsis UBE4/MUSE3 works in concert with a CRL1/SCFCPR1 ligase to regulate stability of the intercellular immune receptors SNC1 and RPS2 that recognise pathogen invasion ( Cheng et al . , 2011; Gou et al . , 2012; Huang et al . , 2014 ) . Taken together with our finding that UBE4 acts in concert with CRL3 ( Figure 3 and Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1 ) , this suggests a single E4 enzyme may assist in diverse ubiquitin-mediated pathways controlled by different E3 ligases . The role of Arabidopsis UBE4 in ubiquitination and degradation of NPR1 are reminiscent of stepwise ubiquitination of the mammalian tumour suppressor p53 , a potent transcriptional activator of genes involved in apoptosis , cell cycle arrest and cellular senescence . The stability of p53 is regulated by amongst others the E3 ligase MDM2 ( or HDM2 in humans ) ( Pant and Lozano , 2014 ) . Although MDM2 limits p53 activity by promoting its turnover , MDM2 only catalyses multi-monoubiquitination of p53 , which is insufficient for recognition by the proteasome ( Lai et al . , 2001 ) . Progression to the polyubiquitinated form of p53 in the nucleus is carried out by the U-box E4 ligase UBE4B that interacts with both MDM2 and p53 ( Li et al . , 2003; Wu and Leng , 2011; Wu et al . , 2011 ) . Although this is similar to the proposed roles of CRL3 and UBE4 in controlling NPR1 stability , initial ubiquitination has different effects on p53 and NPR1 . While MDM2-mediated monoubiquitination controls nucleocytoplasmic trafficking of p53 ( Li et al . , 2003 ) , it probably does not have a direct effect on intrinsic p53 activator activity . Instead , initial ubiquitination boosts NPR1 transcriptional coactivator activity , at least in part by enhancing target promoter occupancy in the short term and potentially also by promoting genomic mobility of NPR1 in the longer term ( Figure 3 ) . Although it remains unclear if CRL3 adds only monoubiquitin or generates short chains shy of tetraubiquitin , the minimal signal required for proteasome recognition ( Thrower et al . , 2000 ) , progression to polyubiquitin chain formation by UBE4 results in transcriptional shut down as polyubiquitinated NPR1 still occupied target promoters but lacked transcriptional potency ( Figure 6D and F ) . This type of stepwise ubiquitination may be a general mechanism to control unstable transcriptional ( co ) activators in eukaryotes . For example , multi-monoubiquitination of the oncogenic growth coactivator SRC-3 results in its transcriptional activation , while subsequent chain extension targets it for degradation , but E4 ligases have not yet been implicated . We propose here that stepwise ubiquitination established by the sequential actions of E3 and E4 ligases may generate a transcriptional timer that controls the activity and lifetime of unstable ( co ) activators ( Figure 7 ) . The complexity of the ubiquitin-dependent transcriptional timer was further revealed by the identification of UBP6 and UBP7 that deubiquitinated NPR1 , thereby regulating its transcriptional activity and lifetime ( Figures 5 and 6 ) . Several unstable mammalian transcription activators , including p53 and the immune activator NF-\u03baB , are also regulated by diverse DUBs ( Colleran et al . , 2013; Pant and Lozano , 2014; Schweitzer and Naumann , 2015 ) . In these cases DUBs promote transcription by stabilising p53 and NF-\u03baB at their target promoters . For example , loss of USP7-mediated deubiquitination of NF-\u03baB resulted in increased turnover and decreased promoter occupancy of NF-\u03baB ( Colleran et al . , 2013 ) . Similarly , we found that knockout of UBP6 and UBP7 resulted in enhanced turnover and decreased\u00a0transcriptional output of NPR1 ( Figure 6 ) . However , inhibition of UBP6/7 deubiquitination activities with WP1130 resulted in enhanced occupancy of transcriptionally inactive NPR1 at the PR1 target promoter ( Figure 6F ) . These data suggest that ( i ) like their yeast and mammalian counterparts ( Hanna et al . , 2006; Lee et al . , 2016 ) , UBP6 and UBP7 exhibit proteasome inhibitory activities that at least temporarily prolong promoter occupancy by NPR1 , and ( ii ) UBP6 and UBP7 prevent inactivation of NPR1 by opposing the formation of long ubiquitin chains . UBP6 showed a similar DUB activity as its mammalian homologue USP14 ( Lee et al . , 2016 ) , in that it appeared to deubiquitinate NPR1 by removing ubiquitin chains en bloc ( Figure 6C and D ) . Such activity places this DUB in direct opposition to UBE4-mediated chain extension activity . In yeast Ubp6 was previously reported to oppose ubiquitin chain extension activity of the E4 ligase Hul5 , thereby regulating substrate recruitment to the proteasome ( Crosas et al . , 2006 ) . Similarly , Arabidopsis UBP6 and UBP7 opposed ubiquitin ligase activities to extend the lifetime of transcriptionally active NPR1 . Although we cannot completely rule out that these DUBs function in opposition to CRL3 , their en bloc ubiquitin removal activity suggests they more likely remove longer ubiquitin chains generated by UBE4 ( Figure 7 ) . Other DUBs may also play a role in regulating SA-responsive gene expression . This is illustrated by our findings that all tested DUB inhibitors blocked NPR1 target gene expression , while mutation of exclusively UBP6 and UBP7 had a similar effect . This discrepancy is expected because the specificity of DUB inhibitors has well-recognised limitations in that they often target multiple related DUBs ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A ) . This is likely especially true for Arabidopsis thaliana which encodes for\u00a0>60 DUB enzymes , many of which cluster into related sub-groups ( Liu et al . , 2008; March and Farrona , 2017 ) . Besides UBP6/7 other DUBs may therefore also play a role in regulating SA-responsive gene expression but their precise functions remain unknown . In summary , we report that disparate ubiquitin modifying enzymes play important roles in establishment of plant immune responses . We demonstrate that the opposing actions of an E3 and E4 ligase pair and two DUBs can fine-tune transcriptional outputs of the unstable immune coactivator NPR1 without strict requirement for its sacrificial turnover . Dynamicity in conjugated ubiquitin chain length may be a powerful mechanism for controlling the activity of unstable eukaryotic ( co ) activators in general . \n All Arabidopsis plants used in this study were in the Columbia genetic background , with WT referring to wild-type Col-0 throughout . Plants were grown under long day conditions ( 16 hr photoperiod ) on soil in controlled-environment growth chambers at 65% humidity and 22\u00b0C unless otherwise stated . Seeds were stratified at 4\u20138\u00b0C in darkness for 2 days before moving to growth chambers . Plants were grown in a soil mix composed of peat moss , vermiculite and sand at a ratio of 4:1:1 respectively , and illumination was provided by fluorescent tube lighting at an intensity of 70\u2013100 \u03bcmol m\u22122sec\u22121 . For experiments on seedlings , seeds were sterilised by washing in 100% ethanol for 2 mins before incubating in 50% household bleach for 20 mins . After removal of bleach , seeds were washed at least 3 times with sterile H2O before use . Sterilised seeds were spotted on Murashige and Skoog agar media and stratified before placing under lighting conditions as above . All T-DNA insertion mutants used were genotyped by PCR using standard conditions with gene specific primers in combination with left-border primers specific to each mutant collection ( Supplementary file 1 ) . The coding sequences of the UBE4 ( At5g15400 ) and UBP6 ( At1g51710 ) genes were amplified using Phusion polymerase ( NEB ) from WT Arabidopsis cDNA with the addition of CACC at the 5\u2019 end required for TOPO cloning . The PCR products were gel-purified and cloned in to the pENTR/D-TOPO vector ( Invitrogen ) according to manufacturers\u2019 instructions . The active site residue of UBP6 was then mutagenised to serine ( C113S ) using QuikChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit according to manufacturers\u2019 instructions . Genes were then recombined into pEarleyGate 104 and 202 plasmids by LR reaction ( Invitrogen ) as described previously ( Earley et al . , 2006 ) to generate 35S::YFP-UBE4 , 35S::FLAG-UBP6 and 35S::FLAG-UBP6 ( C113S ) constructs . These plasmids were used to transform protoplasts or to transform Agrobacterium tumifaciens strain GV3101 ( pMP90 ) as described previously ( Kneeshaw et al . , 2014 ) . After selection of positive Agrobacterium clones carrying the transgenes , approximately 6 week old flowering ubp6/7 plants were transformed as previously described ( Clough and Bent , 1998 ) . Selection of transformants was performed by spraying 10 day old seedlings with 120 \u03bcg/l BASTA at least three times . Further confirmation of transformation was performed by immunoblotting . Segregation of BASTA resistance was analysed in the T2 generation to confirm plants had single transgene insertions . For SA treatments , adult plants were sprayed with , while seedlings were immersed in 0 . 5 mM SA or H2O . CHX , MG132 and DUB inhibitors were all used to treat seedlings by immersion at the concentrations stated in respective figure legends . Vehicle controls consisted of DMSO at the appropriate concentration for each chemical used . Psm ES4326 was grown in LB media supplemented with 10 mM MgCl2 and 50 \u03bcg/ml streptomycin . Cultures were grown overnight then centrifuged at 4 , 000 rpm for 10 mins . Cells were resuspended in 10 mM MgCl2 and absorbance was measured at 600 nm before necessary dilutions were made to adjust concentrations to those indicated in figure legends . Plants were infected by pressure infiltration with a syringe through the abaxial leaf surface . For measurement of bacterial growth , a single leaf disc per plant was cut from infected leaves at the stated dpi and ground in 10 mM MgCl2 . Serial dilutions were plated on LB supplemented with 10 mM MgCl2 and 50 \u03bcg/ml streptomycin and colonies were counted after 2 days incubation at 30\u00b0C . Leaf tissue or whole seedlings were frozen and ground to a fine powder in liquid nitrogen . Samples were homogenised in RNA extraction buffer ( 100 mM LiCl , 100 mM Tris pH 8 , 10 mM EDTA , 1% SDS ) before addition of an equal volume of phenol/chloroform/isoamylalcohol ( 25:24:1 ) . The homogenate was vortexed and centrifuged at 13 , 000 rpm for 5 min . The aqueous phase was transferred to an equal volume of 24:1 chloroform/isoamylalcohol , vortexed and then centrifuged at 13 , 000 rpm for 5 min . This step was repeated once before the aqueous layer was added to a 1/3 vol of 8 M LiCl and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C . The extract was then centrifuged at 13 , 000 rpm for 5 min at 4\u00b0C . The resulting pellet was washed with ice cold 70% ethanol then rehydrated and dissolved in 400 \u03bcl H2O for 30 min on ice . Finally , 40 \u03bcl of NaAc ( pH 5 . 3 ) and 1 ml of ice cold 96% ethanol was added before incubating for 1 hr at \u221220\u00b0C . The precipitate was then centrifuged at 13 , 000 rpm for 5 min at 4\u00b0C , the pellet was washed with ice cold 70% ethanol and resuspended in 50 \u03bcl of H2O . Before cDNA synthesis , RNA samples were quantified using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer ( Thermo Scientific ) and appropriate dilutions were made to ensure all samples contained equal amounts of RNA . Reverse transcription was then performed using SuperScript II reverse transcriptase ( Invitrogen ) according to the manufacturers\u2019 instructions . qPCR was carried out on 20-fold diluted cDNA using Power SYBR Green ( Life Technologies ) and gene-specific primers ( Supplementary file 1 ) on a StepOne Plus Real Time PCR machine ( Life Technologies ) . RNA was extracted from biological duplicate samples as described above and further purified using an RNeasy Mini Kit ( Qiagen ) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions . qPCR was carried out to confirm appropriate induction of SA-responsive marker genes . RNA was then quantified and submitted to GATC Biotech/Eurofins ( Constance , Germany ) for RNA sequencing . The RNA-Seq reads were aligned to the Arabidopsis thaliana TAIR10 genome using Bowtie . TopHat identified potential exon-exon splice junctions of the initial alignment . Strand NGS software in RNA-Seq workflow was used to quantify transcripts . Raw counts were normalised using DESeq with baseline transformation to the median of all samples . Data were then expressed as normalised signal values ( i . e . log2[RPKM] where RPKM is read count per kilobase of exon model per million reads ) for all statistical tests and plotting . Genes were then filtered by expression ( 20%\u2013100% ) and differentially expressed genes determined by Benjamini Hochberg FDR with 2-way ANOVA ( p=0 . 05 ) . Additionally , we required SA-induced genes to meet a\u00a0\u2265\u00a02 fold change cut-off , whereas NPR1-dependent genes required\u00a0\u22651 . 5 fold change in Col-0 or ube4 plants when compared to npr1 mutants . RNA Seq data have been deposited in Array Express at EMBL-EBIunder accession code E-MTAB-7369 . Chromatin immunoprecipitation was performed on leaf tissue of 4 week-old soil-grown adult plants essentially as described ( Yamaguchi et al . , 2014 ) but with minor modifications . 500 mg tissue was crosslinked with 1% formaldehyde by vacuum infiltration for 30 mins at room temperature . Glycine was added to a final concentration of 100 mM to quench crosslinking and vacuum infiltrated for a further 10 mins . Crosslinked tissue was washed twice with ice-cold PBS before all liquid was removed and tissue was frozen in liquid nitrogen . Nuclei were isolated and lysed as described ( Yamaguchi et al . , 2014 ) while sonication was performed using a BioRuptor Plus ( Diagenode ) . Sonication consisted of 15 cycles of 30 s ON , 30 s OFF at high power . NPR1-GFP was immunoprecipitated using ChIP grade anti-GFP ( Abcam ) before capture of immune complexes with Protein A agarose ( Millipore ) .

{"lay_summary": "Genes contain instructions for processes in cells and therefore their activities must be carefully controlled . The addition of small chemical tags called methyl groups to DNA is one of the many ways by which cells can influence gene activity . These methyl groups can silence genes by altering the DNA so that is more tightly packed within the nucleus of the cell . Virus genes and mobile sections of DNA called transposable elements ( sometimes known as jumping genes ) are also silenced by DNA methylation to keep them from doing harm . In plants , methyl groups can be attached to DNA by proteins that are guided to the DNA by molecules called short interfering ribonucleic acids ( or siRNAs for short ) . Each siRNA is made of a chain of 24 building blocks called nucleotides and is able to bind to matching RNA molecules that are attached to the target DNA . The siRNAs are made from longer RNA molecules in a process that involves trimming by an enzyme called DCL3 . However , it is not clear how long these \u201cprecursor\u201d molecules are before DCL3 cuts them down to size . Here , Blevins , Podicheti et al . studied how siRNAs are made in a plant called Arabidopsis thaliana . The experiments show that RNAs containing around 26-45 nucleotides accumulate in cells that lack DCL3 and these cells are unable to make 24 nucleotide long siRNAs . Furthermore , the purified DCL3 enzyme can cut these precursor RNAs to make the siRNAs . Because the precursors are relatively short , the experiments suggest that DCL3 only cuts each precursor RNA once when making siRNAs . Blevins , Podicheti et al . also show that the siRNA precursors are made by a partnership of two RNA synthesizing enzymes . Therefore , a challenge for the future will be to understand exactly how they work together .", "article": "In Arabidopsis thaliana , abundant 24 nucleotide small interfering RNAs ( 24 nt siRNA ) guide the cytosine methylation and silencing of transposons and a subset of genes . 24 nt siRNA biogenesis requires nuclear RNA polymerase IV ( Pol IV ) , RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 2 ( RDR2 ) and DICER-like 3 ( DCL3 ) . However , siRNA precursors are mostly undefined . We identified Pol IV and RDR2-dependent RNAs ( P4R2 RNAs ) that accumulate in dcl3 mutants and are diced into 24 nt RNAs by DCL3 in vitro . P4R2 RNAs are mostly 26-45 nt and initiate with a purine adjacent to a pyrimidine , characteristics shared by Pol IV transcripts generated in vitro . RDR2 terminal transferase activity , also demonstrated in vitro , may account for occasional non-templated nucleotides at P4R2 RNA 3\u2019 termini . The 24 nt siRNAs primarily correspond to the 5\u2019 or 3\u2019 ends of P4R2 RNAs , suggesting a model whereby siRNAs are generated from either end of P4R2 duplexes by single dicing events . \n In plants , transposable elements , transgenes , repetitive sequences and endogenous genes can be transcriptionally silenced by RNA-directed DNA methylation ( Matzke and Mosher , 2014; Pikaard et al . , 2013; Wierzbicki , 2012; Zhang and Zhu , 2011 ) . In this process , 24 nucleotide small interfering RNAs ( 24 nt siRNAs ) bound to an Argonaute family protein , primarily Argonaute 4 ( AGO4; [Zilberman et al . , 2003] ) , guide the cytosine methylation and histone modification of corresponding DNA sequences , leading to chromatin states that are refractive to transcription by RNA polymerases I , II , or III ( Figure 1 ) . Approximately 4000\u20138000 loci in Arabidopsis thaliana give rise to clusters of 24 nt siRNAs , collectively accounting for more than 90% of the total small RNA pool ( Law et al . , 2013; Mosher et al . , 2008; Zhang et al . , 2007 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 09591 . 003Figure 1 . Biogenesis of 24 nt siRNAs and their role in RNA-directed DNA methylation . A simplified cartoon of the RNA-directed DNA methylation pathway . Polymerase ( Pol ) IV and\u00a0RNA-dependent RNA polymerase ( RDR2 ) physically associate and are required for the synthesis of double-stranded RNAs ( dsRNA ) that\u00a0are diced by DICER-like 3 ( DCL3 ) into 24 nt siRNA duplexes . Upon loading into Argonaute 4 ( AGO4 ) , the siRNA-AGO4 complex finds its target sites by binding to Pol V transcripts and by interacting with the C-terminal domain ( CTD ) of the Pol V largest subunit . The cytosine methyltransferase DRM2 is ultimately recruited to Pol V-transcribed loci , resulting in de novo cytosine methylation in all sequence contexts ( CG , CHG and CHH; where H represents a nucleotide other than G ) . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 09591 . 003 Three RNA polymerases are critical for production of non-coding RNAs guiding RNA-directed DNA methylation . These enzymes are nuclear RNA polymerase IV ( Pol IV; Herr et al . , 2005; Onodera et al . , 2005 ) , nuclear RNA polymerase V ( Pol V;\u00a0Kanno et al . , 2005; Pontier et al . , 2005 ) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 2 ( RDR2 ) ( Xie et al . , 2004 ) . Pol IV and Pol\u00a0V are 12-subunit enzymes ( Ream et al . , 2009 ) that evolved as specialized forms of DNA-dependent RNA Pol II ( Haag et al . , 2014; Haag and Pikaard , 2011; He et al . , 2009; Huang et al . , 2009; Lahmy et al . , 2009; Ream et al . , 2009 ) . RDR2 is one of six single-subunit RNA-dependent RNA polymerases in Arabidopsis ( Wassenegger and Krczal , 2006; Xie et al . , 2004 ) . Pol IV and RDR2 are each essential for the biogenesis of 24 nt siRNAs and they physically associate in Arabidopsis and maize ( Haag et al . , 2012 , 2014; Law et al . , 2011 ) , suggesting that their activities are coupled for the production of double-stranded siRNA precursors from initial DNA templates . Pol V is not required for siRNA biogenesis at most loci ( Mosher et al . , 2008 ) but generates non-coding RNAs to which siRNA-AGO4 complexes bind ( Wierzbicki et al . , 2008; 2009 ) . The C-terminal domain of the Pol V largest subunit also interacts with AGO4 ( El-Shami et al . , 2007 ) . Together , these RNA and protein interactions bring AGO4 to the vicinity of the DNA transcribed by Pol V , allowing recruitment of DNA methylation and chromatin-modifying activities that bring about transcriptional gene silencing ( Figure 1 ) . Genetic evidence suggests that coordinated Pol IV and RDR2 transcription yields double-stranded RNAs ( dsRNAs ) that are then cleaved by DICER-like 3 ( DCL3 ) to produce 24 nt siRNA duplexes , one strand of which is incorporated into AGO4 ( Xie et al . , 2004; Zilberman et al . , 2003 ) or a closely related Argonaute protein ( Mallory and Vaucheret , 2010; Zheng et al . , 2007 ) . Because Pol IV localization is unaffected in rdr2 null mutants , but RDR2 is mis-localized in Pol IV null mutants ( Pontes et al . , 2006 ) , Pol IV has been thought to act first in the pathway , generating single-stranded RNAs that then serve as templates for second strand synthesis by RDR2 ( Pikaard , 2006 ) . Current models have also presumed that dsRNAs made by Pol IV and RDR2 are long , perfectly paired duplexes that can be diced into multiple siRNAs , as depicted in Figure 1 . Pol IV and RDR2 will synthesize short transcripts from oligonucleotide templates in vitro ( Haag et al . , 2012 ) , but the sizes of transcripts they are capable of generating is unclear , in vitro or in vivo . Recently , Pol IV and RDR2-dependent transcripts that accumulate in vivo in dcl2 dcl3 dcl4 ( dcl2/3/4 ) mutants were identified ( Li et al . , 2015 ) . In that study , RNAs were fragmented prior to sequencing and short\u00a0sequence reads that overlapped\u00a0were then assembled , computationally , into longer contiguous sequences . These analyses led to the conclusion that Pol IV and RDR2 generate transcripts that can be many hundreds of nucleotides in length , and thus large enough to encode multiple siRNAs , as in current models . Here , we present RNA blot hybridization , deep sequencing , in vitro transcription and in vitro DCL3 dicing results that yield a different interpretation , showing that Pol IV and RDR2 primarily generate dsRNAs shorter than 45 nucleotides . Based on sequence alignments and sequence motifs shared by Pol IV/RDR2-dependent RNAs ( P4R2 RNAs ) and siRNAs , we propose that siRNAs are typically generated by a single internal DCL3 cleavage event whose position is measured from either end of a short P4R2 RNA . \n Previously published RNA blot analyses have shown that in dcl3 null mutants , loss of 24 and 23 nt siRNAs is accompanied by accumulation of RNAs longer than 25 nt but typically shorter than 50 nt ( Blevins et al . , 2009; Daxinger et al . , 2009; Henderson et al . , 2006; Pontes et al . , 2006 ) . A prime example is the intergenic region that separates tandemly arranged 5S ribosomal RNA ( 5S rRNA ) genes , where RNAs of \u223c26\u201345 nt accumulate in dcl3 null mutants ( Figure 2A , lanes 3 , 5 , 7 , 8 ) . These longer RNAs accumulate to their highest levels in dcl2/3/4 triple mutants , in which multiple siRNA processing pathways are impaired ( Figure 2A , lane 8; see also [Henderson et al . , 2006] ) . The longer RNAs that accumulate in dcl2/3/4 triple mutants fail to accumulate in the absence of Pol IV ( nrpd1 subunit mutant ) or RDR2 ( lanes 9 , 10 ) . This indicates that Pol IV and RDR2 are each required for the biogenesis of the longer RNAs , paralleling their requirement for 24 and 23 nt siRNA biogenesis ( lanes 13 , 14 ) . The longer RNAs ( >25 nt ) are also reduced in abundance if Pol V or AGO4 are mutated in the dcl2/3/4 triple mutant background ( lanes 11 , 12 ) , analogous to the degree to which siRNA levels are reduced , but not eliminated , in ago4 or pol V single mutants ( lanes 15 , 16 ) . These observations are consistent with Pol V and AGO4 being important , but not essential , for biogenesis of the majority of 23/24 nt siRNAs ( Mosher et al . , 2008; Pontier et al . , 2005 ) , most likely due to their roles in establishing or maintaining DNA and histone methylation marks that recruit Pol IV to its sites of action ( Blevins et al . , 2014; Law et al . , 2013; Zhang et al . , 2013 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 09591 . 004Figure 2 . RNA blot analyses of 24 nt siRNAs and their precursors . ( A ) The small RNA blot was successively hybridized to probes representing either strand of the siR1003 duplex , a small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) that is derived from intergenic regions separating 5S ribosomal RNA ( rRNA ) gene repeats ( top two images ) , as well as to a trans-acting siRNA ( ta-siR255 ) and a microRNA ( miR160 ) probe . An image of the stained gel under fluorescent illumination ( in the region that includes 5S rRNA and transfer RNAs\u00a0[tRNAs] ) is shown at the bottom as a loading control . ( B ) RNA blot of small RNAs isolated from wild-type ( ecotype Col-0 ) or dcl2 dcl3 dcl4\u00a0triple mutant ( dcl2/3/4 ) plants , with or without prior treatment with ribonuclease V1 or ribonuclease A . The blot was hybridized to a probe designed to detect siR1003 \u2018sense\u2019 , which arises from 5S rRNA gene intergenic spacers . ( C ) Dicing of precursor RNAs by DICER-like 3 ( DCL3 ) in vitro . RNA isolated from wild-type ( ecotype Col-0 ) or from dcl2/3/4 triple mutant plants was incubated with anti-FLAG resin that had been incubated with protein extraction buffer , a cell-free extract of wild-type ( Col-0 ) plants , or a cell-free extract of transgenic plants expressing FLAG-tagged DCL3 . RNAs were then purified , subjected to blotting and hybridized to the siR1003 \u2018sense\u2019 probe . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 09591 . 004 Pol IV and RDR2-dependent >25 nt RNAs ( hereafter named P4R2 RNAs ) hybridize to 5S gene intergenic region probes corresponding to either DNA strand , as do homologous siRNAs ( Figure 2A; top two panels ) . Moreover , the P4R2 RNAs are more sensitive to ribonuclease V1 , which preferentially degrades dsRNAs , than to ribonuclease A , which preferentially digests single-stranded RNAs ( Figure 2B ) . Interestingly , 23 and 24 nt siRNA signals are reduced upon ribonuclease V1 digestion , yet are unaffected by ribonuclease A , suggesting that much of the siRNA pool exists in double-stranded form . We next tested whether P4R2 RNAs that accumulate in dcl2/3/4 triple mutants are substrates for DCL3 . In this experiment , RNA isolated from dcl2/3/4 triple mutant plants was incubated with FLAG-tagged DCL3 that had been affinity\u00a0purified from transgenic plants using anti-FLAG resin . In parallel control reactions , dcl2/3/4 RNA was incubated with anti-FLAG resin that had been incubated with a cell-free lysate of non-transgenic plants ( ecotype Col-0 ) , or with anti-FLAG resin in reaction buffer with no added proteins ( Figure 2C ) . Incubation of RNA from dcl2/3/4 plants with affinity-purified FLAG-DCL3 resulted in the digestion of the >25 nt P4R2 RNAs into 24 nt RNA products ( Figure 2C ) . By contrast , no digestion of the longer RNAs was observed in either control reaction . Collectively , the observations that P4R2 RNAs hybridize to probes representing both DNA strands , are sensitive to dsRNA-specific ribonuclease , and are processed into 24 nt RNAs by exogenous DCL3 supports the conclusion that P4R2 RNAs are the immediate precursors of 24 nt siRNAs in vivo . To identify RNAs that accumulate when dicing is abrogated , we gel-purified \u223c15\u201390 nt RNAs from wild-type ( Col-0 ) , dcl2/3/4 , pol IV ( nrpd1 subunit null ) or rdr2 mutants and conducted RNA sequencing ( RNA-seq ) analyses using Illumina deep sequencing technology , performing two biological replicates for each sample ( see Tables 1 and 2 for sequencing and mapping statistics ) . In wild-type plants ( ecotype Col-0 ) , 24 and 23 nt siRNAs represent the most abundant small RNA class , as expected , outnumbering unique 21 nt small RNA species , which include miRNAs as well as siRNAs , by approximately 10-fold ( Figure 3 ) . In dcl2/3/4 triple mutants , the small RNA profile is substantially altered . Because DCL1-dependent 21 nt RNAs are unaffected , they become the most abundant small RNA class in dcl2/3/4 mutants . The dramatic loss of 23 and 24 nt siRNAs in dcl2/3/4 triple mutants coincides with the occurrence of longer RNAs , mostly smaller than 45 nucleotides and displaying a peak at \u223c30 nt ( see also Figure 3 ) . These genome-wide RNA-seq results correlate closely with the RNA blot hybridization results observed in Figure 2 at 5S rRNA gene loci . Indeed , a browser display of RNA-seq results focused on the region that corresponds to the 5S probes used for Figure 2 ( siR1003 ) shows that\u00a0RNAs that accumulate in dcl2/3/4 mutants range in size from 26\u201342 nt , with a mean size of 30 nt ( Figure 4 ) . These >25 nt RNAs represent both DNA strands and overlap extensively with 24 and 23 nt siRNAs . We conclude that the >25 nt RNAs that accumulate in dcl2/3/4 triple mutants represent one or both strands of P4R2 duplex RNAs . 10 . 7554/eLife . 09591 . 005Table 1 . RNA sequencing statistics .

Browser view of Pol IV/RDR2-dependent RNAs ( P4R2 RNAs ) and 24/23 nt small interfering RNA ( siRNAs ) in the intergenic spacer region of a 5S ribosomal RNA ( rRNA ) gene repeat unit . An isolated 5S rRNA gene repeat ( \u223c500 bp , gray horizontal bar with red transcript region ) is shown within its 5 kb chromosomal context , flanked by two transposable elements , shown in yellow , and a pseudogene , shown in blue . Below the diagram , P4R2 RNAs are depicted as horizontal bars shown in shades of blue whereas 24 and 23 nt siRNAs are shown in shades of gray to black , with color intensity reflecting abundance ( read counts are provided for several examples ) . Each bar represents a specific RNA sequence , with arrows depicting the RNA strand\u00a0orientation relative to the reference genome sequence ( TAIR10 ) . Dotted vertical lines provide alignments and show that the ends of highly abundant ( >100 reads ) siRNA species tend to coincide with the ends of P4R2 RNAs for which there is more than a single read . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 09591 . 009 Although P4R2 RNAs accumulate to their highest levels in dcl2/3/4 triple mutants , as visualized in the RNA blots of Figure 2 , they are also detected by RNA-seq in wild-type plants . Figure 5 shows browser views of three representative loci selected by virtue of having five or more identical reads for at least one P4R2 RNA mapping to the locus in the wild type ( Col-0 ) . Browser views of three additional loci are shown in\u00a0Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1 . In each case , P4R2 RNAs whose positions correspond closely to those of abundant 23 and 24 nt siRNAs ( only 24 nt siRNAs are shown ) are readily detected in dcl2/3/4 mutants and in Col-0 , but are absent in pol IV or rdr2 null mutants , confirming a requirement for both Pol IV and RDR2 for P4R2 RNA biogenesis . Genome-wide , at least 5500 genomic intervals to which 24 nt siRNAs map have overlapping 26-94 nt P4R2 RNAs that are detectable in Col-0 , and typically increase in abundance in dcl2/3/4 mutants , but are absent , or substantially reduced , in pol IV or rdr2 null mutants in one or both biological replicates ( Supplementary file 1 ) . Importantly , the number of mapped RNA-seq reads was similar for the Col-0 , dcl2/3/4 , pol IV and rdr2 RNA-seq datasets ( see Table 2 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 09591 . 010Figure 5 . Pol IV/RDR2-dependent RNAs ( P4R2 RNAs ) are dependent on both Pol IV and RDR2 . ( A\u2013C ) Browser views of three 24 nt small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) loci at which abundant P4R2 RNAs that accumulate in dcl2 dcl3 dcl4 ( dcl2/3/4 ) mutants are also observed in wild-type plants ( Col-0 ) but not in nrpd1 ( Pol IV ) or rdr2 mutants . These examples are representative of a subset of loci selected by virtue of having five or more reads for at least one of the P4R2 species at the locus in wild-type ( Col-0 ) plants . These loci tend to correspond to loci giving rise to abundant siRNAs . Vertical dotted lines provide alignments between abundant siRNAs and the P4R2 RNAs .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 09591 . 011 Consistent with the genome browser views of Figures 4 and 5 , P4R2 RNAs that accumulate in dcl2/3/4 triple mutants show a high degree of correspondence to 24 and 23 nt siRNA sequences , genome-wide . To simplify the discussion we focus solely on 24 nt siRNAs . Ninety-six percent of P4R2 RNAs identified in dcl2/3/4 mutants fully encompass or overlap 24 nt siRNA sequences ( Figure 6A ) . Among the P4R2 loci we identified are 20 of the 22 loci that Li et al . ( Li et al . , 2015 ) confirmed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction to be capable of generating Pol IV and RDR2-dependent RNAs ( Supplementary file 2 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 09591 . 012Figure 6 . Sequence relationships between Pol IV/RDR2-dependent RNAs ( P4R2 RNAs ) and small interfering RNA ( siRNAs ) . ( A ) Correspondence between P4R2 RNA and siRNA loci . P4R2 RNAs were mapped to the Arabidopsis reference genome ( TAIR10 ) and the frequency at which 24 nt siRNAs overlap these P4R2 genomic positions was calculated . To be considered for this analysis , specific siRNAs had to be represented by at least five reads in wild-type Col-0 . Supplementary file 2 shows that P4R2 RNA loci include loci confirmed by Li et al . , 2015 to\u00a0generate\u00a0Pol IV-dependent transcripts . ( B ) P4R2 RNA and 24 nt siRNA spatial relationships . The top panel shows the frequency distribution of P4R2 RNA 5\u2019 end positions relative to siRNA 5\u2019 ends . At position zero on the x-axis , P4R2 RNAs and siRNAs share the same 5\u2019 terminus . Negative values indicate how far ( in nucleotides ) the 5\u2019 end of the P4R2 RNA is located upstream of an siRNA start position . Likewise , positive values indicate how far the 5\u2019 end of a P4R2 RNA is located downstream of an siRNA start position . The lower panel shows the frequency with which P4R2 RNAs and siRNAs align at 3\u2019 ends . At position zero on the x-axis , P4R2 RNAs and siRNAs share the same 3\u2019 terminus . Negative values occur when P4R2 RNAs end upstream of siRNA 3\u2019 ends , and positive values occur when P4R2 RNAs end downstream of siRNA 3\u2019 ends ( computed using FEATnotator , v1 . 2 . 2 , Podicheti and Mockaitis , 2015 ) . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 09591 . 012 We next examined how P4R2 RNAs and their matching siRNAs align with one another . These analyses revealed that siRNAs typically correspond to either the extreme 5\u2019 end or 3\u2019 end of a P4R2 RNA ( Figure 6B ) , with each of these scenarios represented by \u223c100 , 000 examples ( see the peaks at offset position zero ) . This suggests that 24 nt siRNAs are most frequently generated by single internal dicing events , with the cut site measured from either end of a P4R2 precursor duplex . The slight skewing ( non-symmetry beneath the peak ) of the alignment profiles in Figure 6B indicates that siRNAs whose ends do not precisely coincide with the ends of P4R2 RNAs tend to be internal to P4R2 RNAs . To further explore the observation that siRNAs are preferentially derived from the 5\u2019 or 3\u2019 ends of P4R2 RNAs , we searched for sequence motifs that might be common to the ends of P4R2 RNAs and siRNAs . Most 24 nt siRNAs begin with an adenosine ( A ) at the 5\u2019 end ( Figure 7A ) , which has been thought to reflect the RNA binding specificity of AGO4 ( Mi et al . , 2008 ) . By contrast , P4R2 RNAs show a strong preference for having a purine at their 5\u2019 ends , with A or G present at similar frequency ( Figure 7A ) . Aside from this difference , the 5\u2019 ends of P4R2 RNAs and 24 nt siRNAs display intriguing similarities . In both cases , the purine at the 5\u2019 terminus is preferentially preceded by a T in the corresponding genomic sequence , and is preferentially followed by an A or U at the second position ( Figure 7B , compare top two sequence logos ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 09591 . 013Figure 7 . Sequence features of 24 nt small interfering RNAs ( siRNAs ) and Pol IV/RDR2-dependent RNA ( P4R2 RNA ) precursors . ( A ) Frequencies at which the four nucleotides are present at the 5\u2019 terminus of 20\u201325 nt small RNAs in wild-type ( Col-0 ) plants or at the 5\u2019 termini of P4R2 RNAs in dcl2 dcl3 dcl4 triple mutants ( dcl2/3/4 ) . Data for the subset of P4R2 RNAs in the peak size range of 26\u201332 nt is shown . ( B ) Sequence logos for chromosomal DNA sequences corresponding to all 24 nt siRNAs ( in wild-type , Col-0 ) , all P4R2 RNAs , P4R2 RNAs that begin with adenosine ( 5\u2019-A ) or P4R2 RNAs that begin with guanosine ( 5\u2019-G ) . The P4R2 logos were generated using dcl2/3/4 triple mutant data . The logos include three nucleotides upstream and three nucleotides downstream of the chromosomal DNA sequences that match the RNAs . Each unique RNA sequence is represented only once in the input data . For reads mapping to multiple loci , upstream and downstream DNA sequences were obtained from one mapped site selected at random . Graphics were generated using WebLogo v2 . 8 . 2 ( Crooks et al . , 2004 ) . Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1 provides sequence logos for P4R2 RNAs of varying length , showing that consensus sequences are consistent among these RNAs . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 09591 . 01310 . 7554/eLife . 09591 . 014Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1 . Sequence logos for Pol IV/RDR2-dependent RNAs ( P4R2 RNAs ) of different lengths . P4R2 RNAs of discrete lengths ( e . g . , 26 , 27 , or 28 nt , etc . ) were analyzed for potential consensus sequences , with results displayed as in Figure 7 . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 09591 . 014 At their 3\u2019 ends , 24 nt siRNAs preferentially end with a uracil ( U ) , with the order of nucleotide preference at this 3\u2019 terminal position being U >\u00a0C >\u00a0A . P4R2 RNAs also tend to end with U , but the order of nucleotide preference at their 3\u2019 termini is slightly different: U >\u00a0A >\u00a0C . Interestingly , a larger ( but weak ) consensus , ACU can be discerned at the 3\u2019 end of P4R2 RNAs ( Figure 7B; compare top two sequence logos ) . These 5\u2019 and 3\u2019 consensus sequences , determined for P4R2 RNAs considered en masse , regardless of length , hold true for P4R2 RNAs of each length considered separately ( see Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . We next examined whether consensus sequences differ for P4R2 RNAs that begin with A versus those that begin with G at their 5\u2019 ends ( Figure 7B; bottom two sequence logos ) . Interestingly , P4R2 RNAs that begin with A account for the weak 3\u2019 ACU consensus that is detected in analyses of total P4R2 RNAs . By contrast , P4R2 RNAs that begin with G lack the ACU signature , but instead show a preference for U >\u00a0C >\u00a0A at the 3\u2019 terminal position . Interestingly , U >\u00a0C >\u00a0A is the same nucleotide preference order observed at the 3\u2019 termini of 24 nt siRNAs . Collectively , these observations suggest that P4R2 RNAs that begin with A might tend to give rise to 24 nt siRNAs from their 5\u2019 ends , whereas P4R2 RNAs that begin with G might tend to give rise to 24 nt siRNAs from their 3\u2019 ends . It is noteworthy that P4R2 RNAs that begin with G show a strong tendency to end with U , such that the complementary strand ( which can be considered the bottom strand ) is expected to begin with A . Thus , it may be that DCL3 cutting of precursor duplexes preferentially takes place at a fixed distance from a 5\u2019 terminal adenosine present on either strand of the duplex . This hypothesis is consistent with in vitro data of Nagano et al . demonstrating that DCL3 preferentially cleaves dsRNAs with A or U at the 5\u2019 end ( Nagano et al . , 2014 ) . Pol IV , like Pol II , will initiate transcription from single-stranded oligonucleotide DNA templates in vitro ( Haag et al . , 2012 ) . To assess the sizes of RNA transcripts that Pol IV is capable of making in vitro , as well as the possibility that Pol IV may initiate or terminate transcription with favored nucleotides , we used a 7249 nt single-stranded bacteriophage M13 genome as a DNA template and compared transcripts made by affinity-purified Pol IV or II ( Figure 8 ) . For this experiment , Pol IV and II were affinity\u00a0purified by virtue of FLAG epitope tags fused to the C-termini of their NRPD1 or NRPB2 subunits , respectively ( Haag et al . , 2012; Pontes et al . , 2006; Ream et al . , 2009 ) . Previous immunoblot and mass spectrometry studies have shown that affinity-purified Pols II and IV are free of contaminating RNA polymerases ( Haag et al . , 2012; Ream et al . , 2009 ) . In the case of FLAG-tagged Pol IV , the NRPD1-FLAG transgene was expressed in an nrpd1 rdr2 null mutant background ( Haag et al . , 2012 ) , precluding any potentially confounding results due to transcription by associated RDR2 . 10 . 7554/eLife . 09591 . 015Figure 8 . Pol IV transcripts generated in vitro share features of Pol IV/RDR2-dependent RNAs ( P4R2 RNAs ) in vivo . ( A and B ) Size and frequency of RNAs transcribed by polymerase ( Pol ) IV or II in vitro . Pol IV and Pol\u00a0II\u00a0were affinity purified by virtue of FLAG epitope tags fused to the C-termini of the NRPD1 or NRPB2 subunits , respectively . In the case of Pol IV , the transgenic NRPD1-FLAG line is null for the endogenous NRPD1 and RDR2 genes , such that Pol IV is free of associated RDR2 . Transcripts generated using closed-circular single-stranded M13 virus as the DNA template were subjected to RNA-seq . The frequency and sizes of mapped reads are plotted . ( C and D ) Sequence logos for the 5\u2019 and 3\u2019 ends of Pol IV and II in vitro transcripts . RNA-seq , RNA sequencing . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 09591 . 015 RNA-seq analyses revealed that Pol IV and II each initiate transcription in a mostly unbiased manner with respect to position on the circular M13 genome , with Pol IV and II each initiating at more than 2000 positions . The size profiles of RNAs synthesized by Pol IV or II differ , with Pol IV transcripts having mean and median lengths of 44 and 37 nt , respectively , and Pol II transcripts having mean and median lengths of 85 and 68 nt ( Figure 8A , B ) . The 5\u2019 ends of Pol IV and II transcripts are similar , each initiating with a purine just downstream of a pyrimidine , as is typical of DNA-dependent RNA polymerases ( Figures 8C , D ) , but with Pol IV transcripts also displaying a tendency to have A or G at the +2 RNA position ( Figures 8C ) . Interestingly , Pol IV transcripts in vitro tend to end with a C or U ( T in the DNA ) , reminiscent of the tendency to have a U or C ( but also A ) at the 3\u2019 ends of P4R2 RNAs in vivo . But unlike P4R2 RNAs in vivo , Pol IV in vitro transcripts have a very strong preference for an A at the template position immediately downstream of the RNA 3\u2019 end ( Figure 8C ) . A genome browser view of P4R2 precursor RNAs aligned with 24 nt siRNAs at an AtSN1 retrotransposon located on chromosome 3 , a target of RNA-directed DNA methylation we have examined in numerous previous studies ( Blevins et al . , 2014; Haag et al . , 2009; Onodera et al . , 2005; Ream et al . , 2009; Tan et al . , 2012; Wierzbicki et al . , 2008 , 2009 ) , is shown in Figure 9A . In this case , RNA species that differ by one nucleotide are displayed separately , whereas in previous browser views ( Figures 4 and 5 ) , single-nucleotide mismatches were tolerated . Mismatched nucleotides are color\u00a0coded red ( U; T in the context of DNA ) , green ( A ) , tan ( G ) or blue ( C ) in Figure 9A . As is readily apparent , the 3\u2019 terminal nucleotide of P4R2 RNAs and 24 nt siRNAs sometimes does not match the expected sequence . Approximately 5% of all P4R2 RNAs have such 3\u2019 mismatched nucleotides . A graphical depiction of mismatch frequency at each nucleotide position for RNAs of discrete lengths , from 15 nt ( top ) to 76 nt ( bottom ) , is shown in Figure 9B . To generate this plot , background mismatch/error levels ( % of total reads containing a mismatch ) observed at each position for each RNA size class in RNAs of wild-type plants were subtracted from the values obtained for RNAs of the same length in dcl2/3/4 triple mutants . The difference was then plotted , with the intensity of the color reflecting mismatch frequency . Only read sequences with single mismatches or perfect matches to the Arabidopsis genome were considered for this analysis . An enrichment of mismatched nucleotides at the 3\u2019 terminal position of 24 nt RNAs and at the 3\u2019 ends of RNAs longer than 26 nt is readily apparent , with the strongest signals observed among RNAs of 26\u201337 nt , closely matching the peak size distribution of P4R2 RNAs . 10 . 7554/eLife . 09591 . 016Figure 9 . 3\u2019 mismatches detected in 24 nt siRNAs and Pol IV/RDR2-dependent RNAs ( P4R2 RNAs ) may reflect RDR2 terminal transferase activity .

Each horizontal bar represents a specific RNA sequence ( RNA-seq ) , with arrows depicting their direction relative to the Arabidopsis reference genome sequence ( TAIR10 ) . The intensity of shading reflects the abundance of each RNA species in the RNA-seq dataset . Brightly colored nucleotides , color\u00a0coded for A , G , C , or U ( see inset ) , represent nucleotides that do not match the corresponding DNA sequence of the locus . The dotted line highlights the coincident 5\u2019 ends of the most abundant P4R2 RNAs at the locus ( colored deep purple ) and the most abundant siRNAs ( colored black ) . ( B ) Heat map depicting the frequency of mismatched nucleotides at each position of RNAs ranging in size from 15 to 76 nt in dcl2 dcl3 dcl4 triple mutant plants . To correct for the frequency of errors inherent to sequencing , mismatch values for each position of 15\u201376 nt RNAs in wild-type plants were subtracted prior to plotting the data . Only read sequences with single mismatches or perfect matches to the reference genome were utilized for this analysis . ( C ) Over-expression and purification of recombinant RDR2 . The image on the left shows a 7 . 5% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( SDS-PAGE ) gel , stained with Coomassie blue , showing molecular weight markers ( M ) , proteins of un-infected High Five cells ( lane 1 ) , proteins of High Five cells 72\u00a0hr after infection with baculovirus expressing recombinant RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 2 ( RDR2 ) ( lane 2 ) , and purified recombinant V5-tagged RDR2 after affinity purification and elution with V5 peptide . The image at right shows anti-RDR2 and anti-V5 immunoblots of the same three protein samples . For RDR2 detection , rabbit anti-RDR2 primary antibody was used in conjunction with donkey anti-rabbit HRP-conjugated secondary antibody . Detection of V5-tagged RDR2 involved anti-V5 HRP conjugate antibody . ( D ) RDR2 terminal transferase activity . Recombinant RDR2 or an active-site mutant form of RDR2 ( RDR2-ASM ) was incubated with alpha-labeled 32P-CTP and 51 nt RNA substrates bearing 3\u2019 hydroxyl or 3\u2019 dideoxy termini . Reaction products were subjected to denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( PAGE ) and autoradiography . For gel lane 4 , reaction products were treated with RNase One , which degrades single-stranded RNAs , prior to PAGE . RNA size markers were run in lane M . The 51 nt RNA template , 5\u2019 end-labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase , was run as a size marker in the lane at far right . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 09591 . 016 We overproduced full-length recombinant RDR2 ( recRDR2 ) by expressing the protein in insect cells using a baculovirus vector system ( Figure 9C ) . As shown in Figure 9D , RDR2 has terminal transferase activity . In the experiment shown , a 51 nt RNA was incubated with recRDR2 and radioactive , alpha-labeled 32P-CTP , but no other nucleoside\u00a0triphosphates . RDR2 catalyzes the addition of one or two non-templated radioactive cytosines to the 3\u2019 end of the RNA ( Figure 9D , lane 2 ) . This 3\u2019 end-labeling fails to occur using an active site mutant version of RDR2 ( RDR2-ASM ) , in which the magnesium-binding aspartates of the catalytic center have been changed to alanines ( lane 3 ) . Labeling also fails to occur if the 3\u2019 terminal nucleotide of the RNA substrate lacks a 3\u2019 hydroxyl group on the ribose , but instead has a 2\u2019 , 3\u2019-dideoxy ribose ( lane 5 ) . The end-label added by RDR2 is sensitive to RNase 1 , indicating that labeling occurs in the context of single-stranded RNA ( lane 4 ) . Analogous terminal transferase activity has not been detected in Pol IV fractions . Collectively , these results suggest that the 3\u2019 mismatches observed at low frequency among P4R2 RNAs might be telltale signs of RDR2 terminal transferase activity , potentially acting on completed Pol IV transcripts , RDR2 transcripts , or both . \n A recent study reported the identification of Pol IV and RDR2-dependent RNAs whose characteristics included a 5\u2019-monophosphate group , a correspondence to known 24 nt siRNA-producing loci and accumulation in dcl2/3/4 triple mutants ( Li et al . , 2015 ) . These transcripts were deduced to be hundreds of nucleotides in length , on average , based on the computational joining of overlapping\u00a0RNA-seq reads ( Li et al . , 2015 ) . In general , the P4R2 RNAs we identified have similar properties to the RNAs defined by Li et al . , with 20 of the 22 loci scrutinized most carefully by Li et al . matching P4R2 RNAs from our study . Thus , our results extend the results of Li et al . , but indicate that the vast majority of Pol IV and RDR2-dependent RNAs are smaller than 45 nt ( see Figure 3 ) . Dozens of P4R2 RNAs can overlap at a given locus , as shown in Figures 4 and 5 , but we conclude that individual P4R2 RNAs represent individual Pol IV-RDR2 transcription units . Our data indicate that the short double-stranded P4R2 RNAs that accumulate in dcl3 mutants are the immediate precursors of siRNAs , based on the ability of DCL3 to cut these precursors into 24 nt RNAs in vitro . These results are consistent with those of Nagano et al . , who showed that DCL3 preferentially cleaves short synthetic dsRNAs of 30\u201350 nt , but not longer RNAs ( Nagano et al . , 2014 ) . Our analyses indicate that 24 nt siRNAs are preferentially generated from the 5\u2019 or 3\u2019 ends of P4R2 RNAs , suggesting that P4R2 duplex RNAs can be diced from either end , also in agreement with Nagano et al . \u2019s studies . Generation of siRNAs from the ends of P4R2 RNAs , rather than from internal sequences , leads to the prediction that each P4R2 RNA sequence has limited capacity to specify multiple alternative siRNAs . Thus , the multitude of unique 24 nt siRNA sequences present in wild-type cells can be expected to be derived from a similarly large number of P4R2 precursors , depending on whether one or both strands of diced duplexes are utilized as siRNAs . Consistent with this prediction , our sequenced datasets included 1 , 055 , 471 unique 23 or 24 nt siRNA sequences ( in wild-type plants ) and 933 , 453 unique P4R2 RNAs of 26\u201394 nt ( in dcl2/3/4 triple mutants ) . An expectation is that if Pol IV generates single-stranded RNAs that serve as templates for RDR2 , these transcripts would accumulate in an rdr2 mutant and be detectable on RNA blots using sense or antisense probes that detect abundant siRNAs ( such as the 5S gene intergenic spacer siRNAs ) . Alternatively , if RDR2 were to act upstream of Pol IV , which is contrary to current models , but a formal possibility , one might similarly expect to detect RDR2 transcripts in a pol IV mutant . However , our RNA blot results ( Figure 2 ) defy these predictions , as do the RNA-seq data for pol IV and rdr2 mutants . Instead , precursors are depleted if either RDR2 or Pol IV is absent . This suggests that Pol IV and RDR2 are each required for the synthesis of both strands of P4R2 RNA duplexes , as was also noted by Li et al . ( Li et al . , 2015 ) , which fits with the physical association of Pol IV and RDR2 and the hypothesis that the two enzymes function as a complex ( Haag et al . , 2012; Law et al . , 2011 ) . We have shown previously that RDR2 activity detected in vitro using affinity-purified Pol IV\u2013RDR2 complexes from wild-type plants is not apparent using RDR2 affinity\u00a0purified from a pol IV mutant ( Haag et al . , 2012 ) . Although Pol IV isolated from an rdr2 null mutant is active in vitro ( Figure 8; see also [Haag et al . , 2012] ) , it is possible that Pol IV may require RDR2 association for activity in vivo . An important ramification of Pol IV and RDR2 co-dependence is that it is unclear if\u00a0the P4R2 RNAs we cloned and sequenced in our study represent Pol IV transcripts , RDR2 transcripts , or both . Although we detect P4R2 RNAs corresponding to both strands at many ( but not all ) loci , as can be seen in the browser displays of Figures 4 , 5 and 9A , these could be transcripts of only Pol IV or , conversely , only RDR2 . Sequences enriched at the ends of P4R2 RNAs preclude easy assignment of which polymerase generated them . For instance , P4R2 RNAs tend to begin with a purine and end with a pyrimidine such that the complementary strands should also be enriched for purines at the 5\u2019 end and pyrimidines at the 3\u2019 end . The terminal transferase activity inherent to RDR2 provides a plausible explanation for mismatched , untemplated nucleotides at the 3\u2019 ends of some ( \u223c5% ) P4R2 RNAs , but this activity could modify completed RNA transcripts made by Pol IV , RDR2 , or both . Despite these uncertainties , P4R2 RNAs preferentially begin with a purine that , in the context of the genome sequence , tends to occur immediately downstream of a pyrimidine ( in the equivalent DNA strand ) . This pyrimidine\u2013purine rule is a characteristic of DNA-dependent RNA polymerases , in general , and has a structural basis that involves base-stacking interactions between the initiating ( +1 ) RNA nucleotide ( a purine ) and \u22121 DNA template nucleotide ( also a purine ) , in addition to the base-pairing that occurs between the +1\u00a0RNA and +1 DNA template\u00a0bases ( Basu et al . , 2014 ) . The pyrimidine\u2013purine rule has been shown to apply to protein-coding genes throughout the Arabidopsis genome ( Cumbie et al . , 2015 ) , to Arabidopsis pre-rRNAs transcribed by multisubunit RNA Pol I ( these initiate with an A downstream of a T; Doelling et al . , 1993 ) and to 5S genes transcribed by RNA polymerase III ( initiating with a G downstream of a T ) . Our in vitro transcription studies using affinity-purified Pol IV or Pol II also recapitulate the pyrimidine\u2013purine rule . Moreover , Pol IV generates relatively short RNAs in vitro , with size distributions and 3\u2019 ends resembling those of P4R2 RNAs . Collectively , these observations suggest that P4R2 RNA biogenesis is initiated by Pol IV , as depicted in Figure 10 , with limited processivity of Pol IV accounting for the relatively short size of P4R2 RNAs . In our model , designed to account for the consensus sequences of P4R2 RNAs and 24 nt siRNAs ( refer to Figure 7 ) , Pol IV generates first strands that initiate with a purine . Those RNAs that initiate with A best account for siRNA 5\u2019 end sequences , whereas RNAs that initiate with G best account for siRNA 3\u2019 end sequences , suggesting that resulting duplexes , following second strand synthesis by RDR2 , are diced from opposite ends . Because first strand RNAs that begin with G tend to end with U , their complementary strands would tend to begin with A . Thus dicing measured from a 5\u2019 adenosine might be a preference underlying the alternative dicing of P4R2 duplexes from either end . 10 . 7554/eLife . 09591 . 017Figure 10 . Model for the biogenesis of 24 nt small interfering RNAs ( siRNAs ) via single dicing events . Pol IV/RDR2-dependent RNAs ( P4R2 RNAs ) tend to begin with a purine ( A or G ) at position 1 , adjacent to what would be a T at position \u22121 in the corresponding DNA strand and an A ( or U ) at position 2 . A similar signature is detected at the 5\u2019 end of 24 nt siRNAs ( see Figure 7 ) , except that only A ( not G ) is enriched at the 5\u2019 terminus of these siRNAs . Thus , DICER-like 3 ( DCL3 ) cleavage measured from the 5\u2019 adenosine of those P4R2 RNAs that begin with A could account for the similar 5\u2019 end sequences of P4R2 RNAs and 24 nt siRNAs . P4R2 RNAs that begin with A tend to end with ACU , which is not reflected in siRNAs . However , P4R2 RNAs that begin with G tend to end with a 3\u2019 U , with U >\u00a0C >\u00a0A being the order of preference , which matches the 3\u2019 end consensus for 24 nt siRNAs . Because P4R2 RNAs that begin with G most often end with U , their complementary strands ( purple bottom strands in the figure ) would tend to have A at their 5\u2019 ends . DCL3 dicing , measured from this 5\u2019 A , would liberate a top strand ( red in the figure ) whose 3\u2019 end could account for the 3\u2019 consensus ( U >\u00a0C >\u00a0A ) of 24 nt siRNAs .

A line homozygous for ago4-7\u00a0was selected from seed obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center ( stock ID: SALK_095100 ) . The single mutants dcl2-5 , dcl3-1 , and dcl4-2; double mutants dcl2-5 dcl3-1 ( dcl2/3 ) , dcl2-5 dcl4-2 ( dcl2/4 ) and dcl3-1 dcl4-2 ( dcl3/4 ) ; and the triple mutant dcl2-5 dcl3-1 dcl4-2 ( dcl2/3/4 ) were described in ( Blevins et al . , 2006 ) . Genetic crosses between dcl2/3/4 and above-mentioned single mutants were performed to generate the quadruple mutants: rdr2-1 dcl2-5 dcl3-1 dcl4-2 , nrpd1-3 dcl2-5 dcl3-1 dcl4-2 , nrpe1-11 dcl2-5 dcl3-1 dcl4-2 and ago4-7 dcl2-5 dcl3-1 dcl4-2 . A transgenic plant line in which the dcl3-1 mutant was complemented by a full-length DCL3 genomic clone engineered to possess a FLAG epitope tag at the C terminus ( pEarleyGate 302-gDCL3-FLAG ) was previously described ( Pontes et al . 2006 ) . Total RNA ( \u223c100 \u03bcg ) was extracted from leaves of 2-week-old plants using TRIzol ( ThermoFisher Scientific , Grand Island , NY ) and then size-fractionated on RNeasy Mini Columns ( Qiagen , Valencia , CA ) as in Blevins et al . ( 2006 ) . The low-molecular-weight RNA fraction was then separated on a 16% polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a nylon membrane by electroblotting . Different 32P-end-labeled DNA oligonucleotides were used for successive hybridizations: the probe for \u2018siR1003 sense\u2019 was 5\u2019-ATG CCT ATG TTG GCC TCA CGG TCT-3\u2019 , for \u2018siR1003 antisense\u2019 was 5\u2019- AGA CCG TGA GGC CAA CAT AGG CAT-3\u2019 , for \u2018ta-siR255\u2019 was 5\u2019-TAC GCT ATG TTG GAC TTA GAA-3\u2019 and for \u2018miR160\u2019 was 5\u2019-TGG CAT ACA GGG AGC CAG GCA-3\u2019 . Size standards were synthetic RNA oligonucleotides of 15 , 21 , 24 , 30 , and 50 nt lengths . Three- to five-day exposures of the blot were scanned on a Typhoon 9210 phosphorimager system ( GE Healthcare , Pittsburgh , PA ) . Custom libraries for \u223c15\u201390 nt RNAs were constructed and sequenced by Fasteris SA ( http://www . fasteris . com/ ) . In brief , 5 \u00b5g total RNA was subjected to 15% denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis . The desired RNA size-range was excised and eluted , and 3\u2019 and 5\u2019 adapters were added according to the ligation-based Illumina small RNA-seq protocol . Sequencing by synthesis ( 1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0100 ) was performed on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 ( Illumina , San Diego , CA ) instrument following manufacturer\u2019s recommendations ( TruSeq SBS Kit v3;\u00a0Illumina , San Diego , CA ) . Basecalling was performed using the HiSeq Control Software ( v2 . 0 . 10 . 0 ) , RTA ( v1 . 17 . 21 . 3 ) and CASAVA ( v1 . 8 . 2 ) . Insert lengths ranged from 15-94 nt following adapter sequence removal . RNA-seq statistics are provided in Table 1 . Two independent replicates ( Rep 1 and Rep 2 ) for RNA samples of four different genotypes were barcoded and sequenced on a single HiSeq 2500 instrument . Yield ( Mb ) is the total number of sequenced bases . %PF ( % passed filter ) indicates the percentage of clusters ( sequenced polynucleotides ) that fulfill default Illumina quality criteria; Cluster ( PF ) indicates the number of such clusters . Q30 is the percentage of bases detected with a quality score greater or equal to 30 . Mean quality is the average of quality scores for all called bases . Illumina sequence reads were mapped to the A . thaliana Col-0 reference genome ( TAIR10 ) using Bowtie v0 . 12 . 8 ( Langmead et al . , 2009 ) . End-to-end best hits were reported allowing a maximum of one mismatch per read and up to 50 genomic mappings ( for reads with multiple best hits ) . Reads corresponding to 45S rRNA gene arrays , chloroplast transcripts or mitochondrial transcripts were excluded at this stage . For each RNA size class and genomic position , the number of reads mapped with coinciding 5' ends , oriented in the same direction was estimated . Read counts were then normalized by dividing by the total count of mapped reads for the sample and multiplying by the maximum total read count across all samples . For subsequent genomic analyses tRNAs , small nuclear RNAs ( snRNAs ) and small nucleolar RNAs ( snoRNAs ) were excluded from datasets based on their TAIR10 annotation coordinates . Diagrams of P4R2 RNA and siRNA spatial relationships were produced using FEATnotator v1 . 2 . 2 ( Podicheti and Mockaitis , 2015 ) . Sequence logos were generated with WebLogo v2 . 8 . 2 ( Crooks et al . , 2004 ) . RNA-seq reads of \u223c15\u201394 nt ( after adapter trimming ) were mapped to the Arabidopsis thaliana genome ( version TAIR10 ) using Bowtie v0 . 12 . 8 .

RNA-seq data for the eight libraries generated in this study ( Blevins et al . , 2015 ) are available from the National Center for Biotechnology Information Sequence Read Archive ( http://trace . ncbi . nlm . nih . gov/Traces/sra/ ? study=SRP059814 ) Protein extraction and affinity immunoprecipitation were performed as in ( Haag et al . , 2012 ) . Frozen leaves ( 4 . 0 g ) were ground in liquid nitrogen , homogenized in extraction buffer ( 300 mM NaCl , 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7 . 5 , 5 mM MgCl2 , 5 mM dithiothreitol [DTT] , 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride [PMSF] and 1:200 plant protease inhibitor cocktail [Sigma] ) , filtered through two layers of Miracloth ( Calbiochem , San Diego , CA ) , and centrifuged to pellet cellular debris . Supernatants were incubated with 25 \u03bcL anti-FLAG-M2 resin ( Sigma , St . Louis , MO ) for 3 hr at 4\u00b0C on a rotating mixer . Resin was recovered and washed three times with extraction buffer supplemented with 0 . 5% NP-40 . Total RNA ( \u223c360 \u03bcg ) was extracted from wild-type ( Col-0 ) or dcl2/3/4 triple mutant inflorescence tissue and size-fractionated ( see 'RNA blot hybridization' ) to obtain substrates for DCL3 activity assays . Low-molecular-weight RNA was divided into 12-\u03bcg aliquots , which were then mixed with: protein extraction buffer ( buffer control ) , FLAG-resin previously incubated with Col-0 protein extract ( wild-type/resin control ) , or FLAG-resin previously incubated with cell-free extract from transgenic plants expressing the DCL3\u2013FLAG protein ( the DCL3 assay ) . These mixtures were then incubated at 30\u00b0C for 3 hr in dsRNA cleavage buffer ( 50 mM NaCl , 500 \u03bcM adenosine triphosphatase , 100 \u03bcM guanosine triphosphatase , 12 . 5 mM creatine phosphate , 0 . 2 U/\u03bcl creatine kinase , 600 \u03bcM MgCl2 , 0 . 4 U/\u03bcl RNaseOUT ) . RNA products were isolated from the reactions by phenol\u2013chloroform extraction , and then precipitated by addition of 2 \u03bcl GlycoBlue ( Life Technologies ) and two volumes ethanol , followed by centrifugation . The precipitated RNA was washed twice in 75% ethanol , resuspended in loading buffer and analyzed by RNA blot hybridization . Pols II and IV were immunoprecipitated from transgenic lines expressing NRPB2-FLAG or NRPD1-FLAG , respectively , as described previously ( Haag et al . , 2012 ) . Briefly , 1\u00a0g of NRPB2-FLAG transgenic line leaf tissue or 4\u00a0g of NRPD1-FLAG transgenic line leaf tissue ( for Pol IV ) was ground to a powder in liquid nitrogen using a mortar and pestle and then resuspended in 3 . 5 ml extraction buffer ( 20 mM Tris-HCl , pH 7 . 6 , 300 mM sodium sulfate , 5 mM magnesium sulfate , 5 mM DTT , 1 mM PMSF , 1% plant protease inhibitor cocktail [Sigma] ) per gram of tissue . The resulting lysate was subjected to centrifugation at 16 , 000 \u00d7\u00a0g for 15 min at 4\u00b0C and the supernatant was subjected to centrifugation again using the same conditions . 50 \u03bcl of anti-FLAG agarose resin was then added to the supernatant and incubated 3 hr at 4\u00b0C on a rotating mixer . The resin was collected by centrifugation at 200 \u00d7\u00a0g for 2 min and the supernatant was discarded . Resin was washed twice with wash buffer ( 20 mM Tris-HCl , pH 7 . 6 , 300 mM sodium sulfate , 5 mM magnesium sulfate , 5 mM DTT , 1 mM PMSF , 0 . 5% IGEPAL ) and once with CB100 ( 25 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7 . 9 , 20% glycerol , 100 mM KCL , 1 mM DTT , 1 mM PMSF ) . Between each wash , the resin was collected by centrifugation at 200 \u00d7\u00a0g for 2 min and the supernatant was discarded . For Pol II , the washed NRPB2-FLAG resin was resuspended in a final volume of 1ml CB100 buffer . For Pol IV , the washed NRPD1-FLAG resin was brought to a final volume of 50 \u03bcl CB100 . 50 \u03bcl of washed NRPB2-FLAG or NRPD1-FLAG resin was mixed with 50 \u03bcl of 2\u00a0\u00d7 transcription reaction mix ( 18 nM M13mp18 template [Bayou Biolabs , Metairie , LA] , 2 mM each rNTP , 120 mM ammonium sulfate , 40 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7 . 9 , 24 mM magnesium sulfate , 20 uM zinc sulfate , 20 mM DTT , 20% glycerol , 1 . 6 U/ul RNase inhibitor ) and incubated at room temperature for 1 hr on a rotating mixer . Reactions were subjected to centrifugation through Performa spin columns ( EdgeBiosystems , Gaitherburg , MD ) , the filtrate was adjusted to 0 . 3M sodium acetate , and nucleic acids were precipitated with isopropanol . The pellets were resuspended in 8 \u03bcl water and DNase-treated using Turbo DNA-free kit reagent ( ThermoFisher Scientific , Grand Island , NY ) . The samples were then treated with Terminator exonuclease ( Epicentre Biotechnologies , Madison , WI ) to remove potentially degraded RNAs with 5\u2019 monophosphates , cleaned with RNA Clean and Concentrator kit ( Zymo Research , Irvine , CA ) , and then treated with RNA 5\u2019 Polyphosphatase ( Epicentre Biotechnologies ) to convert 5\u2019 triphosphate groups to monophosphates .

RecRDR2 was overexpressed in insect cells using the BaculoDirect\u00a0baculovirus protein expression system ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , Grand Island , NY ) . RDR2 cDNA , amplified by PCR using primers 5\u2019-CACCATGGTGTCAGAGACGACGACGAAC-3\u2019 and 5\u2019-TCAAATGGATACAAGTCCACTTGTTTT-3\u2019 , was cloned into pENTR and recombined into the baculovirus vector using LR clonase . The resulting baculovirus vector was transfected into Sf9 insect cells and recombinant virus was harvested according to the instructions of the manufacturer . RecRDR2 was purified from High Five cells infected with the recombinant virus and lysed in a buffer containing 50 mM HEPES-KOH ( pH 7 . 5 ) , 400 mM KCl , 5 mM DTT , 1 mM PMSF , 5 mM benzamidine-HCl and 10% glycerol . The lysate was subjected to centrifugation at 39 , 000 \u00d7g for 30 min at 4\u00b0C . Anti-V5 agarose beads were used to selectively bind rec_RDR2 in the cleared lysate . The beads were collected by centrifugation at 170 \u00d7\u00a0g for 5 min , washed 3 times with the same buffer , and eluted using V5 peptide in a buffer containing 50 mM HEPES-KOH ( pH 7 . 5 ) , 100 mM NaCl , 0 . 01% of NP-40 and 10% glycerol .

{"lay_summary": "It can take several months , or even years , for the brain of a young animal to develop and refine the complex neural networks which underpin cognitive abilities such as memory , planning , and decision making . While the properties that support these functions have been well-documented , less is known about how they emerge during development . Dom\u00ednguez , Ma , Yu et al . therefore set out to determine when exactly these properties began to take shape in mice , using lightweight nets of electrodes to record brain activity in sleeping newborn pups . The nets were designed to avoid disturbing the animals or damaging their fragile brains . The recordings showed that patterns of brain activity similar to those seen in adults emerged during the first couple of weeks after birth . Just before , however , the brains of the pups went through a brief period of reduced activity: this lull seemed to mark a transition from an immature to a more mature mode of operation . After this pause , neurons in the mouse brains showed coordinated patterns of firing reminiscent of those seen in adults . By monitoring the brains of human babies using scalp sensors , Dom\u00ednguez , Ma , Yu et al . showed that a similar transition also occurs in infants during their first few months of life , suggesting that brains may mature via a process retained across species . Overall , the relative lull in activity before transition may mark when neural networks gain mature properties; in the future , it could therefore potentially be used to diagnose and monitor individuals with delayed cognitive development .", "article": "Mature neural networks synchronize and integrate spatiotemporal activity patterns to support cognition . Emergence of these activity patterns and functions is believed to be developmentally regulated , but the postnatal time course for neural networks to perform complex computations remains unknown . We investigate the progression of large-scale synaptic and cellular activity patterns across development using high spatiotemporal resolution in vivo electrophysiology in immature mice . We reveal that mature cortical processes emerge rapidly and simultaneously after a discrete but volatile transition period at the beginning of the second postnatal week of rodent development . The transition is characterized by relative neural quiescence , after which spatially distributed , temporally precise , and internally organized activity occurs . We demonstrate a similar developmental trajectory in humans , suggesting an evolutionarily conserved mechanism that could facilitate a transition in network operation . We hypothesize that this transient quiescent period is a requisite for the subsequent emergence of coordinated cortical networks . \n Multiple cognitive functions emerge rapidly during early development . Neural networks enable precise spatiotemporal coordination of synaptic and cellular activity in mature brain functions ( Fries et al . , 1997; Maingret et al . , 2016; Peyrache et al . , 2009; Khodagholy et al . , 2017 ) . How immature neural networks develop into their mature form needed for the complex computations underlying cognition remains poorly understood . The first organized and predominant pattern of neural activity that appears in cortical circuits across species is a spindle-like oscillation ( 10\u201320 Hz ) that occurs intermittently on a background of relative neural inactivity . Known as spindle bursts in rodents and delta brushes in humans , this immature network activity is commonly triggered by peripheral stimuli ( An et al . , 2014; Hanganu et al . , 2006; Khazipov et al . , 2004 ) . They demarcate cortical columns or pre-columns and have been linked to neuronal survival ( Golbs et al . , 2011 ) , establishing sensory ensembles , and critical period plasticity ( Khazipov et al . , 2004; Colonnese et al . , 2010; Khazipov et al . , 2013; Winnubst et al . , 2015 ) . Spindle bursts are characteristic of the first postnatal week of rodent development , and delta brushes disappear shortly after term in human neonates ( Torres and Anderson , 1985 ) , emphasizing their transient role in network maturation . In contrast , mature cortex exhibits perpetual , complex patterns of neural activity that appear and interact across a wide range of frequencies ( Tort et al . , 2009; Fujisawa and Buzs\u00e1ki , 2011; Bosman et al . , 2012 ) . The organization of this activity creates precise spatiotemporal windows for neural synchronization , enabling plasticity processes and generation of neural sequences ( Masquelier et al . , 2009; Geisler et al . , 2010; Foster and Wilson , 2006 ) . Such network properties facilitate information processing , and resultant activity patterns have been causally linked to cognitive processes from stimulus perception to learning and memory ( Fries et al . , 1997; Maingret et al . , 2016; Peyrache et al . , 2009; Khodagholy et al . , 2017 ) . Understanding when and how these properties develop in the immature brain is critical given that delay or failure to express mature brain activity is a strong risk factor for subsequent impaired cognition ( Khazipov et al . , 2004; Anderson et al . , 1985; Seelke and Blumberg , 2008; Holmes and Lombroso , 1993 ) . We hypothesized that emergence of these advanced neural network properties could be heralded by the disappearance of immature activity patterns . During this developmental epoch , cortical microcircuits are still undergoing dramatic changes in anatomical connectivity ( Khazipov et al . , 2004 ) and functional connectivity between and within cortical layers is initiated ( Bureau et al . , 2004 ) in part through an abrupt increase in synaptogenesis in superficial layers ( Naskar et al . , 2019 ) . Robust GABA-mediated fast inhibition also appears ( Daw et al . , 2007; Goldberg et al . , 2011 ) as inhibitory network influences of interneurons increase ( Modol et al . , 2020; Tuncdemir et al . , 2016; Favuzzi et al . , 2019 ) . These local circuit changes are paralleled with the gradual ingrowth of subcortical neurotransmitters that assist in setting brain state changes . Together , such modifications could prime a shift in network operating mode , setting the stage for re-emergence of a different oscillation that occupies a similar frequency band , thalamocortical sleep spindles . In contrast to spindle bursts , these oscillations are characteristic of the offline state of non-rapid eye movement ( NREM ) sleep only , and they facilitate memory consolidation ( Maingret et al . , 2016; Latchoumane et al . , 2017 ) . To investigate this hypothesis , we examined neural network dynamics across early rodent and human development . We targeted epochs spanning disappearance of immature activity and emergence of mature sleep patterns in each species . For rodents , we developed conformable , minimally invasive , high-resolution electrocorticography arrays coupled with high-density implantable probes and recorded spontaneous in vivo electrophysiological patterns from unanesthetized mice across the first two postnatal weeks . This approach enabled simultaneous recording of large-scale synaptic and cellular activity without damaging fragile cortical circuits . We found that the transition between immature and mature network dynamics was characterized by unexpectedly decreased coordinated cellular and synaptic activity at the beginning of the second postnatal week . After this timepoint , precise neuronal synchronization and oscillatory coupling in space and time robustly emerged . Analysis of continuous electroencephalography ( EEG ) recordings from human subjects , 36\u201369 weeks post-gestation , revealed a similar developmental trajectory characterized by a transient decrease in neural activity prior to onset of spatiotemporal oscillatory coupling . Therefore , a shift from local , loosely correlated , prominently sensory-driven patterns to internally organized , spatially distributed , and temporally precise activity is preceded by a transient quiescent period . These findings suggest that mechanisms to developmentally regulate functional network capacity may be evolutionarily conserved and manifest on the systems level as similar , discrete states . \n To identify and characterize emergence of advanced neural network properties in the developing brain , we acquired high spatiotemporal resolution electrophysiological recordings from somatosensory cortex of unanesthetized mouse pups aged postnatal day ( P ) 5 to 14 ( n = 108 pups ) , an epoch that spans the transition from immature to mature activity patterns during sleep . We used minimally invasive surface electrocorticography arrays ( NeuroGrids , n = 70 pups ) to permit a spatially extensive survey of cortex . These customized NeuroGrids ( Khodagholy et al . , 2015 ) consisted of 119 electrodes regularly spaced on a diagonal square-centered lattice embedded in 4-\u00b5m-thick parylene C to conform to the cortical surface ( Figure 1A ) . Recordings were made following recovery from surgery to eliminate any influence of anesthesia ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1 and Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . Mice at these ages enter into a cyclical pattern of sleep and wakefulness as assayed by peripheral indicators , such as muscular tone , movements , and heart rate ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . We ensured electrodes used for analysis were located in somatosensory cortex by postmortem histology . Following NeuroGrid recordings , the location of the array was marked on the surface of the brain using a biocompatible fluorescent material ( Rauhala et al . , 2020 ) and tissue was harvested for immunohistochemistry . vGlut2 staining identified the location of primary somatosensory and visual cortices relative to NeuroGrid placement on flattened axial slices ( Figure 1B , upper ) , and the spatially extensive nature of the array compared to the size of the pups\u2019 brains further facilitated anatomical targeting . This histology-based electrode grouping corresponded to spatial localization of electrophysiological activity patterns , identifying electrodes recording from somatosensory cortex ( Figure 1B , lower; Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3 ) . To additionally capture neural spiking patterns across cortical layers , we stereotactically implanted silicon probes ( linear electrode arrangement ) in somatosensory cortex of a separate cohort ( n = 38 pups ) . Immunohistochemistry of coronal slices from these brains verified probe placement within somatosensory cortex , permitted allocation of recording electrodes to cortical layers ( Figure 1C , upper ) , and demonstrated transcortical neural spiking patterns ( Figure 1C , lower; Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4 ) . We expected that physiologically significant features of neural network maturation would be conserved across species . Thus , in parallel , we obtained continuous EEG recordings from normal human subjects 36\u201369 weeks post-gestation ( 1 day\u00a0to\u00a07 months after birth ) , an epoch that similarly spans the transition from immature to mature activity patterns of human sleep and can be mapped to corresponding timepoints of rodent brain development ( Jouvet-Mounier et al . , 1969; Clancy et al . , 2001; Milh et al . , 2007 ) . We first identified epochs of artifact-free behavioral immobility consistent with sleep in the pups ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 5 ) and compared the activity present with human sleep EEG . Sleep in the youngest mouse pups ( P5\u20137 ) was characterized by irregular , discontinuous bursts of neural activity ( Figure 1D , E , upper traces ) . The predominant activity was organized into spindle bursts , oscillations characteristic of developing rodent sensory cortex ( Figure 1D , left spectrogram ) . Sleep in the youngest human subjects recorded was also discontinuous , and contained delta brushes , an oscillatory pattern that develops by 26 weeks post-gestation and disappears around 40\u201344 weeks ( Khazipov and Luhmann , 2006;\u00a0Figure 1E , left spectrogram ) . Delta brushes share morphological and frequency characteristics with spindle bursts . Sleep patterns changed profoundly with maturation in both species . More mature mouse pups exhibited nearly continuous patterns during sleep , an absence of spindle bursts , and the appearance of sleep spindles , which are well-characterized oscillations of NREM sleep ( Figure 1D , lower trace , right spectrogram ) . Human sleep was similarly continuous , and sleep spindles appear during NREM between 1\u00a0and\u00a02 months after term in infants ( Figure 1E , lower trace , right spectrogram ) . This mature sleep in rodents and humans is predominantly governed by internally generated dynamics ( Levenstein et al . , 2019 ) . In contrast , self-generated or evoked movements during sleep are closely associated with local field potential ( LFP ) activity in somatosensory cortex of immature rodents and humans ( Khazipov et al . , 2004; Dooley et al . , 2020 ) . We confirmed that the association between muscular twitches and changes in LFP power ( Figure 1F; n = 6716 twitches from n = 52 pups , sampled randomly to ensure uniform group size; Kruskal\u2013Wallis ANOVA , chi-square = 12 . 93 , p=0 . 0048 ) or detectable spindle band oscillations ( Figure 1G; cross-correlation of twitches and spindle band oscillations exceeded 95% confidence interval , black dashed lines , only in pups aged P5\u20137 ) decreased as the pups matured . These marked similarities in the electrophysiological features of neural activity during sleep across development suggest the possibility of evolutionarily conserved mechanisms of neural network maturation . To investigate how this maturation occurs , we examined the macrostructure of sleep LFP with fine temporal precision over early pup development ( P5\u201314 ) . Mature sleep can be classified into distinct stages ( NREM and REM ) based on electrophysiological criteria , but these indicators do not reliably differentiate the immature analogues of these states ( quiet and active sleep , respectively ) until after P11 ( Seelke and Blumberg , 2008 ) . Therefore , we focused on periods of behavioral and EMG quiescence that lasted for longer than 10 s ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 5 ) , with the goal of preferentially analyzing the transition of quiet sleep ( which contains spindle bursts ) into NREM sleep ( which contains sleep spindles ) . Unexpectedly , recordings across development revealed an epoch of relative neural quiescence at the beginning of the second postnatal week ( Figure 2A ) that corresponded to decreased spectral power and absence of prominent activity at physiological frequencies ( Figure 2B , Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . We hypothesized that this quiescence could be related to a transient decrease in the continuity of the neural signal or the power of the activity that was present . Continuity of neural activity was quantified by determining the duration of neural activity above the wideband noise floor . Although continuity increased markedly from the youngest to most mature animals , we found a decrease in the duration of continuous neural activity that corresponded to the identified period of spectral quiescence ( Figure 2C ) . When we extracted the average wideband power of the continuous activity that was present at each developmental day , there was also a transient nadir at this timepoint ( Figure 2D ) . Because we aimed to characterize the trajectory of the electrophysiological features over time without making a priori assumptions about the nature of the temporal relationship or the rate of change , we employed a modeling approach that considered age as a continuous variable . This approach avoided arbitrary grouping of data from different aged pups without sacrificing statistical power and enabled characterization of the developmental profile beyond testing at individual timepoints . Data were fit with linear and polynomial regression models , and model performance was evaluated using leave-one-out cross-validation ( LOOCV ) to avoid overfitting ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . Polynomial regression provided the best fit for continuity and power data as quantified by the mean squared error ( MSE; Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2B ) . In addition , linear regression was insufficient to model these parameters because linear fit residuals systematically deviated from zero and consistently overestimated observed values at the beginning of the second postnatal week ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2C ) . The best fit models exhibited local minima , and to estimate the age at which these nadirs occurred , we employed a bootstrapping method . Bootstrapping data within each developmental day localized probability of nadir in continuity and power at the beginning of the second postnatal week with likelihood far exceeding the distribution obtained by bootstrapping across days ( Figure 2C , D inset , Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2D\u2013F , Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3 ) . We tested the possibility that the quiescence could be related to a shift in proportion of time spent in each sleep state , a decrease in self-generated sleep movements , or differential recovery from anesthesia across ages . In keeping with previous observations , the proportion of active relative to quiet sleep decreased gradually with maturation ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4A ) and we also found a trend toward fewer self-generated sleep movements in the more mature animals , though this shift was not statistically significant ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4B ) . Recovery from anesthesia was determined individually for each pup , and there was no difference in post-anesthesia stability of oscillation occurrence rate or neural spiking across pups ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . The absence of a marked shift in any of these features during the observed quiescent period makes them unlikely drivers of the phenomenon . Therefore , sleep LFP macrostructure expresses a nonlinear pattern of development that is characterized by a discrete period of relative neural quiescence occurring at the beginning of the second postnatal week . Rate and synchrony of neural spiking strongly contribute to expression of LFP patterns . We hypothesized that changes in neural spiking patterns could accompany the transient quiescent period . Spiking activity was detected in recordings obtained using implantable silicon probes from two non-contiguous sites ( >200 \u00b5m vertical separation ) within the deep layers of cortex ( IV\u2013VI ) and one site within the superficial layers of cortex ( I\u2013III ) per pup recording ( n = 38 pups ) . We first calculated rates of neural spiking only during epochs of above-threshold LFP activity to eliminate effects related to LFP discontinuity . We found that neural spiking increased nonlinearly over the course of development , again with a significant nadir at the beginning of the second postnatal week as quantified using a bootstrapping method ( Figure 3A , Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . These data suggest that lowered intracortical synaptic drive could contribute to the nadir in LFP patterns at the beginning of the second postnatal week . Consistent spiking within neuronal integration time is critical for plasticity processes ( Mainen and Sejnowski , 1995 ) . To estimate this property , we calculated the inter-spike\u00a0interval ( ISI ) between each unique action potential . ISI duration decreased nonlinearly across development , with the longest ISI duration occurring in pups at the beginning of the second postnatal week ( Figure 3B , Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . Population neural spiking at fine time scales is thus both transiently decreased and desynchronized at this time in both superficial and deep cortical layers , resulting in a brief period of relative quiescence prior to the progressive increase in spiking rate and synchrony that accompany subsequent maturation . During mature NREM sleep , there is alternation between periods of neural spiking and hyperpolarization that serves to synchronize neural populations and is implicated in memory consolidation ( Ji and Wilson , 2007; Steriade et al . , 1993 ) . We examined population spiking dynamics in the developing cortex by computing the autocorrelation of spiking activity , which permits quantification of neural synchrony over durations relevant to this slow oscillation ( Figure 3C ) . Significant short time scale ( <50 ms ) interactions ( above the 95% confidence interval ) robustly emerged only after P9 and were prominent in the most mature pups ( Figure 3D , left; n = 38 pups , rank-sum z = \u22124 . 2 , p=2 . 5\u00d710\u22125 ) . All age groups demonstrated significant suppression of spiking activity within the first 500 ms , becoming more marked as development progressed ( Figure 3D , right; n = 38 pups , rank-sum z = 3 . 0 , p=0 . 002 ) . These data implicate that the transient quiescent period demarcates a transition in population spiking that initiates development of a cycle of longer scale network synchronization characteristic of the dynamics observed during mature sleep ( Steriade et al . , 1993 ) . We then sought to understand the functional relevance of this quiescent transition period to network operations . Key LFP properties ( spatial extent , waveform , and power ) can provide an index of the underlying neural population activity and its computational purpose \u2013 the distance over which neurons can be concurrently recruited , as well as the strength and temporal patterning of this activity ( Lowet et al . , 2015; Str\u00fcber et al . , 2017; Cole and Voytek , 2017; Stark et al . , 2014 ) . We detected spindle band oscillations , which were present in pups of all ages , to facilitate comparisons . We quantified spatial extent using the two-dimensional organization of the NeuroGrid to determine the proportion of electrodes expressing co-occurring spindle band oscillations with a reference electrode located in primary somatosensory cortex ( Figure 4A;\u00a0Dahal et al . , 2019 ) . Waveform was characterized using an asymmetry index ( Figure 4B ) and power was extracted from the filtered Hilbert envelope ( Figure 4C ) . Spindle band oscillations in the most immature pups were high power and had a substantially asymmetric waveform , but were expressed over a restricted cortical area ( ~480 \u00b5m diameter ) . In contrast , spindle band oscillations in the most mature pups were lower power and more symmetric , but could variably be detected over a larger spatial extent ( ~1 . 4 mm diameter ) . Given these observed differences in oscillatory parameters , we asked to what extent they could be used to classify the developmental stage at which the oscillations occurred . A coarse tree model based on spatial extent and waveform asymmetry of manually identified oscillations was effectively trained to classify individual spindle band oscillations as originating from immature ( P5\u20137 ) or mature ( P10\u201314 ) pups with 92 . 4% accuracy ( Figure 4D ) , suggesting that these parameters capture defining features of the oscillations at the ends of the developmental spectrum . Spindle band oscillations that occurred during the transient quiescent period at the beginning of the second postnatal week were not consistently classified into either group , instead displaying a unique combination of oscillatory parameters: large spatial extent , low power , and intermediate waveform asymmetry ( Figure 4A\u2013C , yellow bars ) . When examined in a combinatorial fashion , a significant inflection point in oscillation properties emerged between P8\u00a0and\u00a09 ( Figure 4E ) . Polynomial regression provided the best fit for these data ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . Bootstrapping data within each developmental day confirmed localization of a nadir at the beginning of the second postnatal week with likelihood far exceeding the distribution obtained by bootstrapping across days ( Figure 4F ) . These data indicate that oscillations are transformed at the beginning of the second postnatal week , potentially reflecting a transition in neural network function from consistently highly localized cortical processing to capacity for broader , tuned recruitment of neural activity . Oscillations in the adult brain precisely organize neural activity across spatial and temporal scales . A key marker for this organization is cross-frequency coupling , which is important for regulating strength of inputs from different afferent pathways ( Schomburg et al . , 2014 ) and directing flow of information processing ( Buschman and Miller , 2007 ) . The marked shift in oscillatory properties that we observed at the beginning of the second postnatal week suggested that this organizational capacity may also be developmentally regulated . We first investigated the relationship of spindle band activity with other frequencies by detecting epochs of sustained increase in spindle band power and calculating measures of amplitude cross-frequency coupling . Spindle band epochs in the most immature animals ( P5\u20137 ) demonstrated high comodulation across a broad , non-specific range of frequencies , in contrast to frequency-specific comodulation expressed in mature animals ( P13\u201314; Figure 5A ) . Specific , discrete frequency bands that demonstrated significant temporal coupling with spindle band oscillations emerged only after P8\u20139 . Discrete coupling with the gamma band ( 45\u201360 Hz ) first occurred at P10\u201312 , with an additional high gamma band ( 60\u201390 Hz ) arising at P13\u201314 ( Figure 5B; n = 1020 spindle band oscillations from 51 pups; area under the\u00a0curve [AUC] for 45\u201360 Hz chi-square = 10 . 13 , p=0 . 02; AUC for 60\u201390 Hz chi-square = 24 . 29 , p<0 . 001 ) . Taken together , these results suggest that immature networks lack the capacity to couple discrete frequency bands , whereas after the beginning of the second postnatal week such capacity emerges , potentially signaling a developmental shift in the function of oscillations . Furthermore , oscillations facilitate neural communication by biasing spike occurrence to particular phases of the oscillatory waveform . Spindle band oscillations recruited neural spiking above baseline rates to a variable extent across development , with the lowest amount of recruitment occurring at the beginning of the second postnatal week ( Figure 5C , Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . This trajectory significantly deviated from linearity with a discrete nadir confirmed by bootstrapping during this epoch ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A ) . P8 and P9 also exhibited the lowest proportion of recording sessions with significant phase-locking ( kappa > 0 . 1 and alpha < 0 . 05 ) , and consistency of phase-locking abruptly increased at P10 ( Figure 5D , E; n = 38 pups implanted with silicon probes ) . These results reinforce the notion of enhanced information processing capacity in cortical networks after a rapid transitional period at the beginning of the second postnatal week . Thus , multiple LFP and neural spiking measures followed a similar highly nonlinear developmental trajectory marked by a key transition at the beginning of the second postnatal week in mouse pups . We next aimed to investigate whether this pattern of neural maturation was conserved across species . To accomplish this goal , we analyzed clinically acquired continuous EEG data from 54 human subjects ranging from 36 to 69 weeks post-gestation . EEG recordings were included for analysis only if they were reported as normal by the reading epileptologists and the subject had no known underlying neurological or genetic condition . The majority of subjects received a discharge diagnosis of normal movements/behaviors ( e . g . , sleep myoclonus ) or brief resolved unexplained events ( BRUE;\u00a0Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . We analyzed epochs of clinically determined quiet/NREM sleep from each subject using data derived from electrodes overlying human somatosensory cortex ( parietal or central electrodes; no differences were found between these localizations; Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1D ) . Raw traces and normalized spectral analysis suggested an epoch of transient neural quiescence between 42 and 47 weeks ( Figure 6A , B ) , akin to what we observed at the beginning of the second postnatal week in mice . To quantify these observations , we again used regression fitting to determine whether a nonlinear trajectory was present and bootstrapping of data within and between ages to identify any significant nadirs in neural activity patterns . Wideband power of oscillatory activity followed a highly nonlinear trajectory , with a significant nadir between 42\u00a0and\u00a047 weeks ( Figure 6C , Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2A ) . Power spectra revealed a lack of prominent frequency peaks during this epoch , as well as an overall steeper decay in power with increasing frequency ( corresponding to a larger exponent for the modeled power law; Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3A\u2013C ) . Quantification of this aperiodic component of the power spectrum across ages similarly revealed a transient increase around the time of nadir in wideband power ( Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3D , E ) . As expected from previous work ( Torres and Anderson , 1985 ) , duration of oscillatory epochs generally increased over development , but we did observe a period of relative stationarity coinciding with the decrease in wideband power ( Figure 6D , Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2B ) . To assess properties of oscillatory activity in these subjects , we detected spindle band oscillations . Such oscillations were present in all ages , consistent with delta brushes in the youngest subjects and sleep spindles in the older subjects ( Figure 6E ) . We calculated spatial extent of these oscillations as the co-occurrence of spindle band activity across EEG electrodes and found that this activity shifted from highly localized to broader cortical expression around an inflection point between 42\u00a0and\u00a047 weeks ( Figure 6F , Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2C ) . We also found evidence for significant cross-frequency coupling of higher frequencies with the spindle band emerging after 47 weeks post-gestation ( Figure 6G , H; n = 702 spindle band oscillations from 13 subjects; Kruskal\u2013Wallis chi-square for AUC = 138 . 4; p<0 . 001 ) . Taken together , these data support the existence of a conserved transient quiescent period in development that bridges a dramatic shift in functional properties of neural networks . \n We demonstrate that maturation of cortical network dynamics is preceded by a discrete , relatively quiescent , evolutionarily conserved transition period during early postnatal development . During this period , oscillations and neural spiking display a nadir that signals the shift from local , loosely correlated , putatively sensory-driven patterns to internally organized , spatially distributed , and temporally precise activity . Such a developmental inflection point may reflect a rapid and confluent engagement of mechanisms that enable mature computational processes within cortical networks . Self-organization in complex systems is often mediated by processes that can facilitate sudden transitions in system behavior . Our results provide evidence for such a transition in developing cortex of rodents and humans . Because rodent neurodevelopment is temporally compressed relative to humans , an inflection epoch that lasts 1\u20132 days in mouse pups could conceivably extend over weeks in humans ( Clancy et al . , 2001 ) . Prior to this inflection point , oscillatory activity was intermittent with non-uniform cycle-to-cycle waveforms and high broadband frequency coherence . Oscillatory activities after the transition became nearly uninterrupted , exhibiting coupling at discrete frequency bands and increased waveform symmetry . Based on these similarities in oscillatory patterns , we infer that the neural spiking features we observe through invasive recordings in mouse pups could also extend to normally developing human infants , where such recordings are not possible . Neural spiking was more efficiently recruited to oscillatory activity with consistent , strong phase-locking , and higher temporal precision . These features are characteristic of adult neural networks engaged in information processing ( Masquelier et al . , 2009 ) . Thus , a transient period of developmental perturbation may be an evolutionarily conserved indicator of a substantial shift in cortical network operations . Our results suggest that the cortical network dynamics shift to permit temporally precise neural spiking after the transition period . Significantly synchronized firing within 10\u201350 ms intervals was absent prior to this period and robustly emerged afterward . This result is consistent with observed increase in pair-wise correlations of spike activity in visual cortex over development ( Colonnese et al . , 2017 ) . Although recruitment of neural spiking during epochs of spindle burst oscillations in immature rodents likely co-activates neurons that share similar afferent inputs ( Khazipov et al . , 2004; Colonnese et al . , 2010; Khazipov et al . , 2013; Winnubst et al . , 2015 ) , more precise coordination is required for establishment of flexible , defined neural assemblies ( Dragoi and Buzs\u00e1ki , 2006 ) , and the capacity of circuits to express sequential activation of these assemblies is developmentally regulated ( Farooq and Dragoi , 2019 ) . We found that the neural population activity demonstrated correlated suppression over a progressively shorter duration ( from approximately 500 to 200 ms ) with maturation . This process is in keeping with the progressively decorrelated activity patterns observed when analysis is performed on the time\u00a0scale of calcium indicators ( Golshani et al . , 2009; Rochefort et al . , 2009 ) . When oscillations occur in discrete frequency bands , the possibility for complex comodulation arises . This cross-frequency coupling has been linked to information processing in the mature brain , though the precise anatomical substrates and physiological mechanisms that enable its expression are often unknown ( Tort et al . , 2009; Fujisawa and Buzs\u00e1ki , 2011; Bosman et al . , 2012 ) . We demonstrated that prior to the transient quiescent period the dominant cortical oscillations ( centered on spindle band ) exhibit high comodulation extending from 1 to 100 Hz . During this period , broadband comodulation abruptly decreased and was subsequently replaced by discrete gamma oscillations . Therefore , the oscillatory infrastructure to support cross-frequency coupling arises concomitantly with fine time-scale neural spiking synchronization and robust phase-locking of these spikes to LFP , suggesting an emergence of adult-like information processing capacity at this developmental timepoint . Despite sharing a peak frequency , immature and mature spindle band oscillations are highly differentiable on the joint basis of waveform , power , and spatial extent . Correspondingly , the cellular mechanisms that permit expression of these oscillations , as well as their functional purpose , are different . Comparison of oscillatory features can shed light on the functional capacity of the network . We found that although of high amplitude , spindle band frequency oscillations in the most immature mouse pups were highly and uniformly confined to localized regions of cortex ( 200\u2013500 \u00b5m ) roughly corresponding to cortical columns ( Yang et al . , 2013; Feldmeyer et al . , 2013 ) . Similarly , human delta brushes exhibited restricted localization even given the limited spatial resolution of clinical EEG . During the transition period , spindle band oscillations in mouse pups had higher spatial extent , but markedly reduced amplitude , perhaps facilitated by increased intracortical synaptogenesis and maturation of corticothalamic afferents ( Naskar et al . , 2019 ) . The transition period in humans was marked by transiently decreased spatial extent of spindle band oscillations , which we hypothesize is related to attenuation of low-power activity by the intervening tissue between cortical surface and scalp electrode . We observed that mature spindle band activity across species was characterized by increased and customizable spatial extent . Thus , the end of the transient quiescent period marks capacity for oscillatory frequencies that were previously confined to local processing units to extend into broader cortical areas with the potential to establish intercortical communication . Our study was limited to somatosensory cortex , and the existence of a transient quiescent epoch outside of this brain region is unknown . Similar to our results in the spindle band , early gamma oscillations disappear around the beginning to the second postnatal week , to be later replaced with gamma rhythms characteristic of adult animals ( Minlebaev et al . , 2011 ) . In visual cortex , a transient nadir in continuity was not identified , but continuity did rise sharply after P8 with a nonlinear trajectory ( Shen and Colonnese , 2016 ) . Furthermore , the least synchronous neural spiking activity in visual cortex occurred at the beginning of the second postnatal week , potentially in keeping with our decrease in temporal precision of spiking at this time ( Colonnese et al . , 2017 ) . Higher order cortices , which do not directly receive sensory thalamic inputs , may express a different developmental trajectory , in keeping with their distinctive role in information processing , though oscillatory expression during this same epoch has been identified as critical for intact adult function ( Bitzenhofer et al . , 2015; Bitzenhofer et al . , 2021; Bitzenhofer et al . , 2020 ) . Therefore , multiple lines of evidence support an abrupt change in cortical network function at the beginning of the second postnatal week . It is possible that our use of surface arrays , which sample summated LFP\u00a0activity from the undisturbed superficial cortical layers ( I\u2013III ) , highlights the transient quiescent state compared to penetrating probes that disrupt the cortical surface upon implantation . Furthermore , our conducting polymer-based electrodes have lower impedance than the silicon probes used in most neonatal rodent studies ( Khodagholy et al . , 2015 ) , potentially increasing the sensitivity to changes in oscillatory power and continuity . Given the multitude of anatomic and functional changes that occur during the early postnatal epoch , it is likely that the shift in network operating mode we observe is mechanistically multifactorial . A potential driver for this state is maturation of functional cortical inhibition . Functional inhibitory connections regulate physiological oscillations in mature neural networks enabling submillisecond precision of spike timing and facilitating inter-regional synchronization ( Buzs\u00e1ki and Chrobak , 1995; Cobb et al . , 1995; Pouille and Scanziani , 2001 ) . In contrast , interneurons do not substantially pace immature oscillations during the first postnatal week , though they can be recruited to and contribute to spatial properties of this activity ( Khazipov et al . , 2004; Minlebaev et al . , 2011 ) . Functional feedforward inhibition rapidly matures around the beginning of the second postnatal week in mice , resulting in emergence of adult-like hyperpolarizing synaptic potentials and precisely timed action potentials in glutamatergic neurons within the microcircuit ( Daw et al . , 2007 ) . This timepoint , derived from in vitro data , temporally overlaps with the onset of adult-like neural network activity we observe in vivo . In the human brain , when mature functional inhibition arises is not known , but ongoing migration of cells that differentiate into interneurons in the months after birth ( Paredes et al . , 2016 ) suggests the possibility of a postnatal transition to such network activity . The aperiodic component of the power spectrum has been linked to excitatory-inhibitory balance ( Gao et al . , 2017 ) , and our finding that this value transiently increases during the quiescent period could support a temporary increase in inhibition in the human brain . Such a mechanism could underlie the known postnatal disappearance of the EEG bursts characteristics of trace alternant ( Ellingson and Peters , 1980 ) , resulting in the observed low-voltage state with lack of organized oscillatory activity prior to emergence of mature NREM sleep patterns . Whether a period of quiescence is required for physiological transition to mature cortical processing remains unclear . Manipulations that could modulate its expression , such as alteration of the neuromodulatory milieu , activation/suppression of specific cell-type activity , or modulation of the sensory environment ( Smith et al . , 2018 ) , could address this question . Forging linkages to activity patterns observed using calcium imaging ( Wilson et al . , 2018 ) and enabling high spatiotemporal resolution chronic in vivo electrophysiology will also be critical . In humans , neuronal dynamics suggestive of mature information processing mechanisms are established by 6 months of age ( Jannesari et al . , 2020 ) , and changes in sleep patterns have been identified as markers for brain connectivity from toddlers to adolescents ( Kurth et al . , 2017 ) . Extending such measures to earlier timepoints could help to clarify functional ramifications of the quiescent period in humans . Furthermore , the manifestation of a developmental epoch of relative quiescence in electrophysiological activity suggests the possibility for use as a network-level biomarker that could be altered in disorders of neurodevelopment , from mouse models to human subjects . Neural processes in the adult brain are characterized by a specific constellation of network dynamics that are necessary for execution of complex behaviors and cognition ( Tolner et al . , 2012 ) . Our results suggest that the capacity for these processes simultaneously emerges abruptly after a distinct transition period characterized by relative neural quiescence . This transient quiescent period may be a critical stage that indicates a shift in the neural network operating mode from a predominantly external stimulus-driven state to one that facilitates the internal representations associated with planning and executive function . \n PEDOT:PSS ( Clevios PH1000 ) was purchased from Heraeus . Ethylene glycol , ( 3-glycidyloxypropyl ) trimethoxysilane ( GOPS ) , 4-dodecyl benzene sulfonic acid ( DBSA ) , and\u00a03- ( trimethoxysilyl ) propyl methacrylate ( A-174 silane ) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich . Micro-90 concentrated cleaning solution was purchased from Special Coating Services . AZnLOF2020 ( negative photoresist ) , AZ9260 ( positive photoresist ) , and\u00a0AZ 400K and AZ 300MIF ( metal ion free ) developers were acquired from MicroChemicals , Merck . To create the PEDOT:PSS films , a mixture of aqueous dispersion ( Clevios PH1000 ) and ethylene glycol was prepared and mixed with GOPS ( 1\u00a0wt% ) and DBSA ( 0 . 1 wt% ) . The fabrication process involved deposition and patterning of parylene C , evaporation of Au for electrodes and interconnects , and PEDOT:PSS films coating . Parylene C ( 1 . 2-\u03bcm-thick ) was deposited on quartz wafers ( 100 mm outer diameter [O . D . ] , thickness of 1 mm ) using an SCS Labcoater 2 . For the metal lift-off , AZnLOF2020-negative photoresist was spin-coated at 3000 r . p . m . on the substrate , baked at 105\u00b0C for 90 s , exposed to ultraviolet light using a Suss MA6 Mask Aligner , and developed with AZ 300MIF developer . Metallic layers ( 10 nm Ti , 150 nm Au ) were deposited using an e-beam metal evaporator ( Angstrom EvoVac Multi-Process ) and patterned by soaking the substrate in a bath of resist remover . A second layer of parylene C ( insulation layer ) was deposited to a thickness of 1 . 2 \u03bcm and its adhesion to the bottom layer was enhanced by the addition of 3- ( trimethoxysilyl ) propyl methacrylate ( A-174 silane ) during chemical vapor deposition . An anti-adhesion agent ( 5 wt% Micro-90 diluted in deionized water ) was deposited on the substrate followed by an additional sacrificial layer of parylene C that was subsequently used for the peel-off process . The stacked layers were patterned with a layer of AZ9260-positive photoresist and dry etched with a plasma-reactive ion-etching process ( Oxford Plasmalab 80; 180 W , 50 sccm O2 , and 2 sccm SF6 ) to shape electrode area and electrical contact pads . Specifically , AZ9260 was spin-coated at 5000 r . p . m . , baked at 115\u00b0C for 90 s , exposed using a Suss MA6 Mask Aligner , and developed with AZ400K developer ( 1:4 with deionized water ) . To obtain clean etching of large areas , the electrical contact pads were guarded by an extra layer of AZnLOF2020 ( 3000 r . p . m . ) between the metal layer and the silane-treated parylene . Each pad was etched along its perimeter , and the parylene deposited on top of the photoresist was removed once immersed in acetone bath . Finally , PEDOT:PSS was spin-coated on top of the electrodes and patterned by peeling off the last parylene layer . The probes had 119 electrodes regularly spaced on a diagonal square centered lattice with pitch of 77\u2013177 \u00b5m and regularly interspersed perforations were created . Total device thickness was 4 \u00b5m . All animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Columbia University Irving Medical Center . Data from 108 Swiss-Webster mouse pups ( 3\u20139 g , 5\u201314 days of age ) that underwent intracranial implantation was used for neurophysiological analysis . Pups were kept on a regular 12 hr\u201312 hr light-dark cycle and housed with the mother before surgery . No prior experimentation had been performed on these mice . Anesthesia was induced by hypothermia in ice for P5\u20136 pups and with 3% isoflurane for pups aged P7\u201314 . Pups were then comfortably placed on a customized platform for head fixation , surgery , and recording . Acclimatization to head fixation was not performed as it has been found to be unnecessary for neonatal rodents; careful positioning and \u2018swaddling\u2019 was performed to maximize pup comfort ( Blumberg et al . , 2015; Corner and Kwee , 1976 ) . All animals were maintained under anesthesia with 0 . 75\u20131 . 5% isoflurane during surgery . Time under anesthesia was minimized to facilitate postoperative recovery . Pre- and postoperative systemic and local analgesics were employed , including subcutaneous bupivacaine , systemic ketoprofen , and topical lidocaine . These analgesics were selected to attain appropriate pain control while minimizing effects on neurophysiological activity in the postoperative period ( Blumberg et al . , 2015; Foley et al . , 2019 ) . Electrodes fabricated from fine gauge wire were inserted into the subcutaneous tissue of the neck and abdomen . These electrodes continuously registered electrocardiography ( ECG ) and electromyography ( EMG ) signals throughout the surgical and recording period , and were used to monitor recovery from anesthesia . A custom metal plate was attached to the skull to provide head fixation . For NeuroGrid implantations , a craniotomy was centered over primary somatosensory cortex and the array was placed over the dura . For silicon probe implantations , H32 NeuroNexus 32-site single-shank probes were used . A small cranial window over primary somatosensory cortex ( approximately AP \u22121 . 5 mm , ML 2 mm; adjusted proportionally based on pup age ) was opened , and the probe was stereotactically advanced until all electrodes were inserted below the pial surface ( 900 \u00b5m ) . Postoperatively , the pup was comfortably positioned , provided with familiar olfactory cues , and placed in a custom recording box with temperature and humidity control . Temperature was regulated by a heater equipped with feedback control to ensure stable , physiological body temperature of the pups throughout the recording period . Neurophysiological signal acquisition was performed in the custom recording box , which was grounded to shield ambient electrical noise . Concurrent video monitoring was performed using a camera mounted inside the box . Pups recovered from anesthesia , as determined by recovery criteria including increase of heart rate to plateau and onset of sleep-wake cycling , for a minimum of 30 min before neurophysiological recordings were used for analysis . The recovery period was prolonged until recovery criteria were met , and all pups used for experimentation recovered within 60 min postoperatively . Neurophysiological signals were amplified , digitized continuously at 20 kHz using a local preamplifier ( RHD2000 Intan Technology ) , and stored for offline analysis with 16-bit format . Spontaneous activity was acquired for 1\u20132 hr prior to euthanasia and perfusion . At the end of experimentation , pups were euthanized with an overdose of pentobarbital ( 100 mg/kg ) . For the NeuroGrid experiments , the position of the array was visualized using light microscopy and the brain tissue underlying the corners of the array was stereotactically marked using a 30 gauge needle coated with chitosan compound ( Rauhala et al . , 2020 ) . Pups were perfused with phosphate-buffered saline ( PBS ) , followed by 4% paraformaldehyde . Brains were stored for 24\u201348 hr in 4% PFA at 4\u00b0C prior to transfer to PBS solution . Cortices were \ufb02attened at room temperature ( RT ) after removal of the underlying midline structures and kept in 4% PFA for 24 hr ( 4\u00b0C ) . Flattened cortices were sliced using a Leica vibratome vt1000S at 50 \u00b5m . The slices were then incubated for 1 hr at RT in a blocking solution composed of PBS ( 0 . 01 M ) , 3% Normal Donkey Serum , and 0 . 3% Triton X-100 . Slices were transferred to a solution containing anti-Vesicular Glutamate Transporter 2 ( VGlut2 ) polyclonal guinea-pig antibody ( AB2251-I Sigma Millipore ) in a 1:2000 dilution and kept overnight at 4\u00b0C . Subsequently , the tissue was washed and incubated with secondary antibody , Alexa Fluor 594 Af\ufb01niPure Donkey Anti-guinea pig IgG ( H+L ) ( 706-585-148 ) from Jackson Immunoresearch at 1:1000 dilution . Lastly , the tissue was incubated with DAPI ( D9542-5MG; Sigma-Aldrich ) at 0 . 2 \u00b5g/mL and after washing , the brain slices were mounted with Fluoromount-G ( 00-4958-02 , ThermoFisher ) . Fluorescent images were captured and tiled using a computer-assisted camera connected to an ECHO Revolve microscope . The images were adjusted for brightness and contrast and assembled into panels using ImageJ and Adobe Illustrator . The regularly spaced , hexagonal lattice of electrode spacing across the NeuroGrid enabled localization of each electrode relative to the marked corners of the array and primary sensory cortices . The spatially extensive nature of the NeuroGrid relative to pup brain size facilitated consistent anatomical targeting . Localization of silicon probe electrodes to cortical region and layers was performed using a combination of intraoperative visualization and histological reconstruction . Probes were inserted under visual guidance , with the most superficial electrode placed just below the pia . Regular , precise spacing of electrodes along the shank enabled determination of each electrode\u2019s depth from the cortical surface . Coronal brain slices stained with DAPI and vGlut2 permitted localization of probe implantation site relative to barrel cortex . All recordings were visually inspected for quality , and channels that exhibited ongoing electrical or mechanical artifact were removed from analysis . Data was analyzed using MATLAB ( MathWorks ) and visualized using Neuroscope . Raw recordings were downsampled to 1250 Hz to obtain LFPs , and band-pass filtered between 250 Hz and 2500 Hz for analysis of neural spiking . Signals from EMG wires inserted into nuchal and ventral subcutaneous tissue were high-pass filtered at 300 Hz , rectified , and smoothed to obtain a power envelope . The mean of this high-pass filtered power was determined . Epochs consistent with high tone were identified when the signal surpassed a threshold defined by 1 . 5\u20133 . 5 standard deviations above this mean . Wakefulness was defined as a period of sustained high tone for at least 1 . 5 s . Myoclonic twitches involving contractions of the muscles of the head , forelimbs , hindlimbs , or trunk as observed on video recording were correlated with an increase in EMG signal that surpassed the threshold for < 1 . 5 s . Muscle atonia ( consistent with sleep ) was identified when the EMG signal remained below the threshold for at least 2 s . Sleep epochs were further classified as putative active or quiet sleep . Quiet sleep was identified when muscle atonia was paired with quiescence of behavior for at least 10 consecutive seconds . Active sleep was identified by myoclonic twitches that occurred on a background of muscle atonia . Similar approaches have been shown to correlate with electrophysiological markers of active and quiet sleep , and have been used for state-dependent developmental analyses ( Seelke and Blumberg , 2008; Turek , 1999 ) . We retrospectively analyzed EEG recordings from 54 patients who underwent continuous monitoring with surface EEG as part of clinical diagnostic assessment . Analysis of these data was approved by the Institutional Review Board at Columbia University Irving Medical Center , and all data collection occurred at this institution . All data reviewed was initially obtained for clinical management purposes and informed consent was waived as per 45 CFR 46 . 116 . Each patient had EEG electrodes placed based on the internationally recognized 10\u201320 configuration . Electrode impedance was monitored and maintained within appropriate ranges as per American Clinical Neurophysiology Society Guidelines by certified clinical EEG technologists . Patients ranging in age from birth to 8 months who had at least 4 hr of high-quality continuous EEG monitoring were identified through the clinical electrophysiology database ( Natus ) . Using the hospital admission record , patients were excluded if ( 1 ) the EEG was reported as abnormal by the reading electrophysiologist; ( 2 ) the patient had a known underlying neurological or genetic condition; ( 3 ) the patient was diagnosed with a new neurological condition during the course of the hospital admission; and ( 4 ) corrected gestational age could not be determined from information contained in the medical record . Indication for EEG in eligible patients was most commonly paroxysmal movements concerning to parents for abnormal activity , with discharge diagnosis identifying normal movements/behaviors ( e . g . , sleep myoclonus , roving eye movements during REM sleep ) or BRUE ( Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . Corrected gestational age , rounded to the nearest week , was used to classify patient age . If the phrase \u2018full term\u2019 was employed in the medical record , corrected gestational age was calculated based on birth at 40 weeks . This approach allowed a precision of 2 weeks in corrected gestational age . Recordings always included both waking and sleep epochs . Three to five representative epochs of artifact-free quiet/NREM sleep were identified for subsequent analysis by a certified clinical electrophysiologist . Data was sampled at 256\u2013512 Hz by clinical amplifiers . Raw data ( referential ) exported from Natus was used for all analyses . If electrical noise contaminated the recording , a 60 Hz notch filter was used . P3 or P4 electrodes , overlying the parietal lobe , were selected for spectral analysis . If these electrodes were non-functional , C3 or C4 electrodes , overlying the central sulcus , were used . No differences were found when using data derived from parietal and central electrodes in subjects where all channels were functional . To visualize spectrograms , a parametric autoregressive ( order of 1 ) whitening method was first applied to the data . For rodent data ( sampled at 1250 Hz ) and human data ( sampled at 256\u2013512 Hz ) , time-frequency decomposition was performed using analytic Gabor wavelet transform to enhance temporal resolution . Wavelet spectrograms centered at twitch times were normalized by z-scoring and averaged to obtain trigger-averaged spectrograms . Power was extracted for quantification from the magnitude of the analytic Gabor wavelet transform . Epochs of oscillatory activity were defined by presence of rectified signal amplitude above the 99th percentile of the wideband noise floor . To measure periodic and aperiodic properties of human neural data , power spectra were extracted using multi-taper method ( http:/chronux . org ) and modeled using \u2018fitting oscillations and one over f\u2019 ( Corner and Kwee , 1976 ) . In order to quantify the changing tendency of each feature over time , we modeled the trends with linear and polynomial regression models . To find the optimal fit that most accurately represented the overall trend without overfitting , we used LOOCV to evaluate the models . The model with the minimum MSE was considered to have the best fit . When model fit predicted existence of local extrema , we used bootstrapping to estimate the location of these extrema for the trajectory of each property we investigated . For animal data , we resampled with replacement within each day from P5 to P14 . For human data , we resampled within each 1\u20132 weeks . Age was jittered with a window of 0 . 5 days and 0 . 5 weeks for animal and human data , respectively , to aid with fitting . We found the age corresponding to the first peak or trough of the regression line across development . This process was repeated 10 , 000 times to generate a probability distribution of location of local extrema across the developmental trajectory . The same process was repeated using resampling with replacement across all timepoints of the trajectory ( 10 , 000 iterations ) to generate a null distribution for comparison . Spindle band oscillations were detected based on wavelet-derived power and duration parameters . Intervals of oscillatory activity containing spindle band power were first detected and a ratio of normalized autoregressive wavelet ( Gabor ) -based\u00a0PAR was then calculated to identify discrete spindle band oscillations . Oscillatory intervals were detected by comparing the spindle band power ( Pspi ) of 8\u201325 Hz with threshold . Thresholds were determined relative to median absolute deviation ( median ( |Pspi| ) 0 . 6745 ) in the sleep intervals . Because this value varied markedly across development , thresholds were derived empirically but kept consistent across each age group . The value was decreased for silicon probe recordings in P5\u20137 pups compared to NeuroGrid recordings to maintain consistent detection despite quantifiably different signal to noise ratio . PAR\u00a0was then calculated based on the following equation:PAR=Pspi- ( Plow+Phigh ) Pspi+Plow+Phighwhere spindle band power ( Pspi ) was based on 8\u201325 Hz , low band power was based on 1\u20135 Hz ( Plow ) , and high band power was based on 30\u201380 Hz ( Phigh ) . Spindle band events were identified when the ratio crossed \u20130 . 1 for a minimum of 300 ms and a maximum of 5 s and had a peak greater than 0 . All detections were visually inspected for accuracy for each recording session and independently verified by an analyst blinded to detection parameters . In human EEG data , spindle band oscillations were detected across all channels as in mice , using a constant threshold relative to median absolute deviation ( median ( |Pspi| ) 0 . 6745 ) in the intervals of quiet/NREM sleep and PAR was calculated as above . For subjects aged less than 40 weeks , the low band power was based on 2\u20136 Hz to aid with accurate detection of delta brushes . The channel with maximal oscillation power in the spindle band was selected for further analysis . Spindle band oscillations were characterized by their power , spatial extent , and spindle asymmetry ( Cole and Voytek , 2017 ) . Power was calculated by bandpass filtering each spindle band oscillation between 8\u00a0and\u00a025 Hz . We then calculated the rectified value of Hilbert transformed filtered signals to derive the power envelopes . The median value of each spindle band oscillation was defined as its power . Spatial extent was calculated by determining the number of channels simultaneous expressing spindle band oscillations with a manually selected channel located in primary somatosensory cortex for mice and the channel with the highest spindle band power for humans ( intersection of spindle start and end points > 300 ms and separation of spindle midpoints \u2264 50 ms on channels being compared ) . The spatial extent was expressed as a ratio of the number of channels with simultaneous occurrence and the total number of functional channels on the NeuroGrid . Data used for these calculations had a similar proportion and placement of channels located within primary somatosensory cortex . To quantify the sharpness of each spindle band oscillation\u2019s peak and trough , they were first broadly bandpass filtered at 5\u201330 Hz . Rising and falling zero-crossing points were identified . Peaks were recognized as the maximum timepoint in raw data between a rising zero-crossing point and a falling zero-crossing point; troughs were recognized as the minimum timepoint in raw data between a rising zero-crossing point and a falling zero-crossing point . Sharpness of a peak was defined as the mean difference between the voltage at the oscillatory peak Vpeak and the voltage at timepoints before ( Vbefore ) and after the peak ( Vafter ) , where the timepoint corresponded to a phase shift of approximately \u03c0 ( 8 ms ) . Trough sharpness was defined similarly:Sharppeak=Vpeak-Vbefore+ ( Vpeak-Vafter ) 2Sharptrough=Vbefore-Vtrough+ ( Vafter-Vtrough ) 2 As the absolute difference between the extrema and the surrounding timepoints increases , the extrema sharpness increases . Extrema mean sharpness ratios ( ESR ) were calculated as a metric to quantify the sharpness asymmetry of each spindle . The ESR was defined in the following manner:ESR=1Npeaks\u2211peakssharppeak1Ntroughs\u2211troughssharptrough Larger deviation from 1 indicated greater sharpness asymmetry of the spindle . Spectral analysis of the data was performed , and any data contaminated with electrical noise ( 60 Hz ) was eliminated from analysis to prevent spurious correlations . Comodulograms of cross-frequency coupling were computed based on a Gabor wavelet of raw data around the time of spindle band oscillation ( 4 s ) , followed by a Gaussian window convolution with duration matched to the frequency . The correlation matrix was calculated based on the magnitude of the wavelet components . Comparisons with p<0 . 05 after Bonferroni\u2013Holm correction for multiple comparisons were considered statistically significant . Columns of the correlation matrix corresponding to spindle band ( 10\u201320 Hz ) were extracted and summated to obtain a curve representing the magnitude of frequency coupling to this band . Each local maximum coupling value was detected along with its peak prominence ( how significant a peak is on account of its intrinsic value and location relative to other peaks ) and peak width ( frequency range with between half-prominence points ) . Peaks were thresholded based on prominence and width ( \u0394f < 1/fc , peak prominence > 0 . 75 ) . Wide-band coupling index was calculated by ( peak value \u00d7 peak prominence ) /peak width . AUC was calculated by integrated the summated coupling curves . Neural spiking was detected on each channel by thresholding negative peaks greater than four times the high-pass filtered noise floor during epochs of sleep . Coincident spike times across a greater distance than expected for physiological spike waveforms ( ~300 \u00b5m ) were presumed to be non-physiological and eliminated from all channels . Electrodes were allocated based on histology and electrophysiological characteristics into zones roughly corresponding to superficial ( I\u2013III ) and deep ( IV\u2013VI ) cortical layers . Electrodes from two non-contiguous sites ( >200 \u00b5m vertical separation ) within the deep cortical layers and one site from superficial cortical layers were used for subsequent analysis . Because individual neuron action potentials could potentially be detected on more than one channel , spikes occurring on different channels within the same histological zone < 2 ms apart were presumed to be duplicate detections and only the first spike was used for analysis . ISIs for the neural population were calculated as the absolute time between sorted spike times within the zone . A modified convolution method was used to determine 95% confidence intervals for population spike time autocorrelograms with a bin size of 10 ms . Peristimulus time histograms were calculated using a bin size of 50 ms with 95% confidence intervals determined from a shuffled distribution of spike times . To derive spike phase-locking to spindle band oscillations , the oscillatory epochs were first downsampled to 125 Hz and narrowly bandpass filtered at 9\u201316 Hz . Phase was extracted using Hilbert transform . Phase bins \u03c0/24 were used for quantification of spike phase preference . Statistical analysis was performed using a combination of open-source MATLAB toolboxes and custom MATLAB code . A modified convolution method was used to determine 95% confidence intervals for correlograms . Significance of phase-locking to spindle band oscillations was determined using alpha < 0 . 05 with a corresponding kappa value of > 0 . 1 Kuiper test ( Circular Statistics Toolbox for MATLAB ) . Null distributions were generated based on 500 instances of data shuffling and used to calculate 95% confidence intervals . Probability distributions were compared using two-sample Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov tests with correction for multiple comparisons . Differences between groups were calculated using non-parametric rank-sum ( Wilcoxon ) or ANOVA ( Kruskal\u2013Wallis with Bonferroni correction ) depending on the nature of the data analyzed . When event size varied between groups , a random sample of events was selected from groups with larger event sizes to ensure group differences were not driven by degrees of freedom . Error bars represent standard error of mean . Testing was two-tailed and significance level was p<0 . 05 .", "headings": ["Abstract", "Introduction", "Results", "Discussion", "Materials and methods"], "keywords": ["neuroscience"], "id": "elife-69011-v2"}
{"lay_summary": "Malaria is an infectious disease that is estimated to kill more than half a million people every year , mostly young children in Africa . It is spread by mosquitos that are infected with Plasmodium parasites that attack red blood cells in the human body . Plasmodium falciparum , the species that is responsible for most of these deaths , causes malaria by entering red blood cells and releasing antigens that travel to the surface of the cells , where they change the adhesion properties . This causes the infected red blood cells to accumulate in small blood vessels , surface capillaries or the brain , which can have severe consequences for the person infected . P . falciparum is particularly dangerous because of its ability to vary the antigens displayed on the cell surface: this process , known as antigenic variation , helps to maintain infections for extended periods of time by allowing the antigens to stay one step ahead of the immune system ( a process known as immune escape ) . The origins of antigenic variation lie in the fact that each P . falciparum genome has a repertoire of between 50 and 60 var genes that code for the variability of a major antigen that is responsible for immune escape in malaria . Molecular sequencing has shown that local parasite populations contain thousands of different types of var genes: hence , meiotic recombination in the mosquito can create a vast number of combinations of var repertoires . Artzy-Randrup et al . have developed a computational model of this highly diverse and complex system to address the following question: is a local pathogen population composed of largely random and ephemeral repertoires of these genes , or is it structured into independently circulating strains ? Their model goes beyond previous models by including interactions within the local host population that arise as a result of indirect competition between different strains of the pathogen for available hosts: this competition is influenced by the history of infection and , therefore , by the patterns of immunity within the host population . Previous models included within-host processes but not these higher , local population-level interactions . The model simulates the dynamics of all the unique combinations of var genes in a population of hosts , and shows that even with high rates of reproduction , the parasite population self-organizes into a limited number of coexisting strains: the distinct var repertoires of these strains only weakly overlap , suggesting that the immune response of the host population has been partitioned into distinct niches . By investigating genetic variation at both antigenic sites and regions of the genome that do not code for antigens , Artzy-Randrup et al . suggest that immune selection\u2014the selection imposed on var repertoires by the build up of specific immunity at the population level\u2014plays a central role in structuring parasite diversity . The new model should lead to a better understanding of the epidemiology of Plasmodium and other pathogens that work in similar ways , including Trypanosoma brucei ( sleeping sickness ) , Borellia burgdorferi ( Lyme disease ) and Giardia lamblia ( gastroenteritis ) , and help with global efforts to eliminate malaria and other diseases .", "article": "The coexistence of multiple independently circulating strains in pathogen populations that undergo sexual recombination is a central question of epidemiology with profound implications for control . An agent-based model is developed that extends earlier \u2018strain theory\u2019 by addressing the var gene family of Plasmodium falciparum . The model explicitly considers the extensive diversity of multi-copy genes that undergo antigenic variation via sequential , mutually exclusive expression . It tracks the dynamics of all unique var repertoires in a population of hosts , and shows that even under high levels of sexual recombination , strain competition mediated through cross-immunity structures the parasite population into a subset of coexisting dominant repertoires of var genes whose degree of antigenic overlap depends on transmission intensity . Empirical comparison of patterns of genetic variation at antigenic and neutral sites supports this role for immune selection in structuring parasite diversity . \n Many pathogen populations seem to be composed of several independent strains; this has important implications for disease surveillance and control , as well as for the identification of vaccine targets . In particular , the population genetic interactions between pathogen strains can have significant epidemiological consequences , influencing transmissibility , clinical immunity , and the duration and severity of infection . An extensive variety of microparasites have been studied in this context: protozoa , such as Plasmodium falciparum , Leishmania , and Trypanosoma brucei; viruses , such as Influenza , HIV and Dengue; and bacteria , such as E . coli , Bordetella spp . and Neisseria meningitides ( Tibayrenc et al . , 1990; Gupta et al . , 1994; Tibayrenc and Ayala , 2002 ) . The conceptual challenges and significant human health implications associated with the pathogen population structure have led to the establishment of several theories for why we observe this structure in nature ( Selander et al . , 1987; Tibayrenc et al . , 1990; Smith et al . , 1993; Gupta and Day , 1994a , 1994b; Gupta et al . , 1996; Tibayrenc , 1994 ) . In particular , while it would seem that sufficient out-crossing should always lead to random associations between alleles ( Tibayrenc et al . , 1990; Tibayrenc and Ayala , 2002 ) and preclude the persistence of \u2018independently transmitted strains\u2019 ( Tibayrenc , 1994 ) , mathematical models of competition between pathogen strains have demonstrated that immune selection can lead to the maintenance of discrete , non-overlapping , antigenic repertoires\u2014even when antigenic variability is driven by several unlinked genes that undergo recombination ( Gupta et al . , 1996; Gupta and Anderson , 1999 ) . An inherent challenge in testing \u2018strain theory\u2019 is to determine whether observed empirical patterns in pathogen population structure result from immune selection , or alternatively , from simple demographic processes ( i . e . , uneven relatedness among individuals in the pathogen population that can result from random genetic drift , particularly within the complex context of transmission dynamics ) ( Buckee et al . , 2008 , 2011 ) . P . falciparum is responsible for the deadliest type of malaria in humans . The complexities of its population genetics , in terms of the variable and often enormous levels of sequence variation observed at antigenic sites within local populations , are intimately tied to both its pathology and its ability to escape immune detection . While this genetic complexity provides significant challenges to malaria research and control , it also provides an opportunity to extend existing strain theory in a way that can be tested empirically . Specifically , an important extension of earlier strain theory is to consider the effects of immune selection in populations of pathogens whose antigen-encoding loci are: ( a ) multi-copy and recombining ( i . e . , located on different chromosomes of a haploid genome ) , and ( b ) undergoing antigenic variation via sequential , mutually exclusive expression within an infected host . It is not clear whether a stable strain structure would emerge under the sequential expression of multi-copy genes . Consideration of this type of system provides a more complete framework for understanding antigenic structure and its epidemiological consequences in a broader variety of pathogens; it also offers the opportunity to distinguish the effects of immune selection from those of neutral demographic forces , providing testable predictions for these two alternative mechanisms . We describe an agent-based model that extends strain theory to address the effect of immune selection acting on multi-copy antigen genes; we use the var gene family of P . falciparum as the basis for this model . The var genes encode P . falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 ( PfEMP1 ) \u2014the major surface antigen of the parasite's blood stages that binds to host endothelial cell receptors to allow the parasite to sequester within various host tissues ( Miller et al . , 2002; Scherf et al . , 2008 ) . Var genes are composed of multiple Duffy-binding-like ( DBL ) and cysteine-interdomain-rich ( CIDR ) domains that encode binding functions for specific endothelial receptors . DBL\u03b1 , is the only domain found in nearly all var genes ( Miller et al . , 2002 ) , and hence is the most informative molecular marker of var gene diversity . Each parasite genome has up to 60 var genes , and differential sequential expression of these genes allows the parasite to evade the host immune response and establish a chronic infection . This clonal antigenic variation sensu stricto ( Miller et al . , 2002; Scherf et al . , 2008 ) extends the duration of infection to facilitate transmission to the mosquito . Not only do var genes influence transmission , but specific var genes are associated with severe malarial disease and specific PfEMP1 binding phenotypes ( Deitsch et al . , 2009; Chan et al . , 2012; Claessens et al . , 2012; Lavstsen et al . , 2012; Warimwe et al . , 2012 ) . Population studies have shown that individual P . falciparum genomes have distinct repertoires of var genes ( Barry et al . , 2007; Scherf et al . , 2008; Chen et al . , 2011 ) that extensively recombine ( Freitas-Junior et al . , 2000; Taylor et al . , 2000 ) during sexual recombination in the mosquito ( Paul et al . , 1995 ) . The immense sequence diversity observed among var genes and var repertoires has been attributed to high rates of meiotic ( and possibly also mitotic ) recombination . These high rates of recombination presumably allow for very low linkage disequilibrium among var loci . Our modeling framework considers the dynamics shaping the enormous potential diversity of genomic repertoires of var genes by tracking all possible var repertoires , given a diverse pool of genetic variants . We explore whether structured parasite populations resulting from the selection pressures exerted by competition among distinct var repertoires for hosts , mediated by cross-immunity , can emerge . \n We model the dynamics of multiple parasite genomes that simultaneously circulate in a large host population , continuously tracking the formation of new genomes through recombination , mutation and immigration events ( Paul et al . , 1995; Bruce et al . , 2000a , 2000b ) . Reliable numerical results require the simulation of explicit transmission events , as well as complete knowledge of the exposure history of each individual host with respect to past and present infections by different parasite genomes . Thus , an agent-based model is formulated that follows each host from birth to death , while recording their exposure history and the specific immunity each gradually gains as a result of infections ( for a detailed description of the model see the \u2018Materials and methods\u2019 section ) . The simulated host population is continuously exposed to an immense diversity of distinct var repertoires , since new combinations of var genes are continuously generated through meiotic recombination events . As a conservative example , consider the number of potential configurations arising from the combinatorial possibilities of 6 loci with 50 var genes in the pool: more than 3 \u00d7 107 repertoires ! Despite this large potential diversity , simulation results show that only a few dominant var repertoires circulate and persist at any given time , effectively keeping var repertoire diversity orders of magnitude lower than is potentially possible given the number of var genes present in the host population ( Figure 1 ) . We find that epidemiological dynamics significantly limit the diversity of coexisting dominant genomes under a broad spectrum of transmission intensities . This pattern persists in the long-term , far out-living the influence of initial conditions , and persisting through occasional changes in the identity of the dominant var repertoires ( Figure 1 ) . Thus , on epidemiological ( and longer ) time scales , most of the parasite population is structured into a limited number of distinct var repertoires . 10 . 7554/eLife . 00093 . 003Figure 1 . Characteristic time series demonstrating the emergence and maintenance of population structure under three levels of recombination probabilities , 0 . 001 ( a ) , 0 . 01 ( b ) and 0 . 1 ( c ) , while keeping all other parameters equal . Top: stacked histograms of the number of genome transmission events per year of the different circulating repertoires , each represented by a different color . All var repertoires sampled less than 50 times are pooled and plotted in grey . Bottom: The corresponding number of transmission events of each var gene per year ( each gene plotted in a different color ) . As recombination increases , population turnover is more rapid , still showing well-defined population structure . Although dominant genome identities may change in time , the level of transmission per gene is relatively constant and hardly influenced by turnovers on the strain population level . The relative fraction of short-lived genomes increases with recombination ( grey area ) , and although the total number of transmission events per year is not influenced by recombination rate , cases of transmission of de-novo genomes is higher for higher levels of recombination . Parameters: b = 18 , G = 30 , g = 6 , \u03b1 = 15 , H = 10 , 000 , \u03c9 = 0 . 0005 , \u03c4 = 1 . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 00093 . 003 We find that the parasite population structure exhibits punctuated turnover: brief episodes of restructuring result in a new set of dominant var repertoires . Despite the changing identities of the dominant var repertoires , the overall diversity of repertoires present and the individual gene frequencies remain remarkably constant ( Figure 1 , lower panels ) . These transient phenomena punctuate periods of stasis with stable population structure . In essence , although there are an effectively infinite number of niches in host immunity space , var repertoires appear to exploit this space by partitioning it into a number of discrete and partially overlapping niches . In addition , these repertoires appear to quickly adapt and achieve some optimum after perturbations arising from the stochastic nature of the underlying demographic and transmission processes . The episodes of restructuring become more frequent as recombination rates increase , but the diversity of dominant var repertoires remains low throughout these semi-stable states . Indeed , the maintenance of structure is found to be robust even under very high levels of recombination ( Figure 1 ) . The emergence of pathogen population structure is robust to alternative formulations of our multi-locus model that do not consider sequential expression , or formulations that consider randomly ordered sequential expression . In addition , episodes of restructuring can also be observed when expression is not sequential . The level of diversity remains orders of magnitude lower than that potentially allowed by the var gene pool itself . However , as transmission intensity increases , the overlap between distinct dominant var repertoires also increases , with completely discordant genomes only appearing at the lower end of the spectrum ( see Figure 2 ) . To capture the characteristic features of different population compositions we defined four metrics: N* , measuring the average number of successful transmission events per year , V* , measuring the average number of de-novo genomes transmitted per year , R* , measuring the diversity of var repertoires , and F* , measuring the degree of var overlap between distinct repertoires ( see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019 ) . We find that as transmission intensity ( biting rate ) increases , all four measures increase as well , and that epidemiological dynamics clearly constrain var repertoire diversity and structure parasite populations , with the degree of overlap determined by epidemiological parameters ( Figure 3A\u2013D ) . Our findings are robust to different host population sizes ( from 1 , 000 to 100 , 000 individuals ) , different gene pools sizes ( from 10 to 500 ) , and different repertoire lengths ( from 2 to 30 ) ( Figure 3 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 00093 . 004Figure 2 . Different degrees of distinct var repertoire overlap with transmission intensity . The number of genome transmission events per year for the different circulating repertoires are represented by different colors as stacked histograms similar to those of Figure 1 . Emerging populations are typically characterized for low transmission intensities ( A ) , by a low number of dominating genomes with a low level of antigenic overlap ( R* = 9 . 2 , F* = 1 . 2 , see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019 ) ; and for high transmission intensities ( B ) , by higher diversity and higher antigenic similarity ( R* = 17 . 5 , F* = 2 . 1 ) . The fraction of long-lived genomes dominating transmission events is labeled by A in both figures , and the fraction of short-lived genomes , by B ( these are grouped into one single number and plotted in gray ) .

( A ) A measure of diversity capturing the number of dominating genomes ( R* , in the y-axis ) as a function of b , ( B ) , a measure of average antigenic similarity between genomes ( F* , in the y-axis ) as a function of b , ( C ) the average number of novel repertoires generated and successfully transmitted each year , and ( D ) the total number of successful transmission events each year . As transmission intensity increases , the number of dominating genomes increases , and in accordance , the degree of antigenic similarity increases as well\u2014however the number of distinct repertoires that are maintained in the system at epidemiologically relevant frequencies remains extremely low relative to the total number of distinct repertoires that can be crated through recombination . Note the differences in magnitude; while the number of de novo repertoires entering the system is 10-fold higher then the observed diversity , the number of successful transmission events that these dominating repertoires are involved in is on the order of 106 . For extremely low biting rates , in a narrow window of parameter values , diversity decreases abruptly ( A ) . This reflects a different dynamic regime in which dominant strains replace each other in a fluctuating manner and population structure does not apply .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 00093 . 005 The model suggests that areas that experience different transmission intensities will exhibit \u2018characteristic\u2019 epidemiological signatures ( Figure 4 ) . Importantly , the gain of immunity is found to depend on the degree of repertoire overlap ( i . e . , the number of shared var alleles ) among the different dominant genomes and not just on total prevalence ( Figure 5 ) . This is an important difference with compartmental transmission models that consider superinfection but have no explicit treatment of var genes and repertoire diversity . 10 . 7554/eLife . 00093 . 006Figure 4 . Age profiles of immunity and infection: ( A ) In color are the number of hosts immune to a single arbitrary antigen in different age classes superimposed over a histogram representing the entire age distribution of hosts ( in gray ) . The level of immunity in each class is shown for four different transmission intensities ( b = 2 , 4 , 8 and 30 , where b is the average number of biting events per host per year ) . ( B ) The average level of immunity to the general antigenic pool as a function of age . It can be seen in ( A ) and ( B ) , that at higher levels of transmission intensity , exposure to the diversity of antigenic types typically shifts towards the younger age classes , and hosts gain high levels of immunity to a majority of the variants earlier on in life . ( C ) A measure of parasite rate demonstrated by the fraction of infected hosts in different age groups ( see also Gupta and Day , 1994b ) for 2 transmission intensities ( b = 2 and 8 ) . ( D ) A measure of superinfection demonstrated by the average number of antigens an infected host is na\u00efve in each age class . Under high-transmission regimes , we characteristically observe high levels of superinfection ( i . e . , relatively long durations of infection ) and high parasite rates in the very young age classes , after which immunity is rapidly gained to most of the antigenic variants circulating in the population . In contrast , host populations in regimes of very low transmission , characteristically exhibit similar levels of parasite rates in all age groups , and immunity is gradually gained throughout life , with infection spanning all age classes .

( A ) Diagram demonstrating the partition of 40 genes from the general pool ( represented by circles ) between 8 dominating strains ( each marked with a unique color , and composed of a subset of 6 genes ) . Five of these strains are antigenically unique as they have no overlap with any of the other strains , two of these strains share all of their genes with other strains ( red and light blue ) , and one of the strains has a partially unique antigenic profile sharing 66% of its genes with other strains ( purple ) . ( B ) The number of hosts immune to strains 1 and 2 ( orange and red , respectively ) for each age class superimposed over the host age distribution ( grey ) . Immunity to strain 1 is strain specific and only gained through exposure to this particular strain due to the uniqueness of its antigenic profile . By contrast , immunity to strain 2 is strain \u2018transcending\u2019 and acquired also by exposure to other strains with which it shares genes . It follows that hosts are exposed to strain 1 at a higher level and at younger ages , than those for strain 2 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 00093 . 007 Two recent large-scale studies aimed at assessing the extent of local reservoirs of var genes in five epidemiologically and geographically distinct P . falciparum populations ( Barry et al . , 2007; Chen et al . , 2011 ) provide us with new knowledge on the distribution of var genes in parasite genomes . These new data clearly show that the frequency distribution of distinct var genes , or sequence \u2018types\u2019 ( defined by the level of sequence identity within the DBL\u03b1 domain ) is significantly different from what we would expect if sequence types were equal in frequency and uncorrelated ( Figure 6 ) . In addition , the data show significant nonrandom associations among many var DBL\u03b1 types within the sampled isolates ( Figure 6 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 00093 . 008Figure 6 . Nonrandom organization of var DBL\u03b1 types between 30 sampled parasite isolates from Amele , Papua New Guinea as published in ( Chen et al . , 2011 ) . ( A ) Presence\u2013absence matrix showing the distribution of var types in isolates: Each row corresponds to an individual parasite isolate and each column to a distinct var type . The color bar indicates the number of distinct isolates each var type was identified in . ( B ) The frequency distribution of the number of isolates in which each var type was identified , obtained by assuming a total var richness of \u223c369 , as estimated in ( Chen et al . , 2011 ) . The observed distribution for the data ( red ) and the expected distribution when assuming all var types circulate at equal frequencies ( blue ) were found to be significantly different ( pv<0 . 0001 using a K\u2013S two sample test ) . Note the enrichment for both very rare and very common var types in the data . ( C ) Observed and expected co-occurrence of var DBL\u03b1 types . In each matrix cell ( i , j ) is the number of times var types i and j were found in the same isolate . The co-occurrence of var types found in multiple isolates is significantly higher than for the null expectation under the assumption of linkage equilibrium among all var types ( pv<0 . 01 ) ( Artzy-Randrup and Stone , 2005 ) ( the expected co-occurrence matrix conserves both the observed number of var types in each isolate and the observed frequency distribution of different var types ( Chen et al . , 2011 ) ) . ( D ) A network of allele pairs with both high D and r . The D values are among the highest pair-wise comparisons in the dataset ( using a cutoff of D > 0 . 0748 ) , and the r values range from 1 to 0 . 58 , and are reflected by the weight of the edges . Based on sequence features ( Bull et al . , 2007 ) , and the fact that genomic organization of var sequence groups appear to be conserved across globally distributed isolates ( Kyes et al . , 2007 ) , it is very unlikely that var type 22 ( being UpsA-like ) is physically linked to the other alleles in the network ( since they are all UpsB/UpsC-like ) . ( E ) The relatedness of the var DBL\u03b1 repertoires of an isolate pair as a function of the relatedness of their microsatellite repertoires . Relatedness is defined as the number of var types shared between the two isolates , divided by the average number of var types identified per isolate for that pair of isolates . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 00093 . 008 These patterns in observed var repertoires may alternatively result from neutral demographic processes: that is , individual mosquitoes bite discrete hosts , and thus , inevitably sample the host population unevenly . This limits \u2018random mating\u2019 and thus recombination between parasite genomes . Hence , even under neutral forces , it is possible for parasites to differ in their relatedness to one another . Under this alternative assumption we expect these neutral demographic processes to shape the diversity at all loci to the same extent ( after controlling for differences in physical linkage and recombination rate between loci ) . Evidence of more extensive \u2018strain structure\u2019 at antigenic , immune-selected sites compared to neutral sites suffices as proof that selective forces are at work , and of these , immune selection is the most parsimonious explanation . We compare patterns of variation at immune-selected sites to neutral sites in a variety of ways ( see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019 ) , and we propose this as an effective empirical test of strain theory . Our test is conceptually similar to empirical analyses of strain theory undertaken in the past ( Buckee et al . , 2010 ) , but in this system , there is the opportunity for a more powerful test since the multi-copy nature of var genes allows us to examine patterns of variation at many independent ( i . e . , physically unlinked ) genetic sites . Currently , the dataset with the most extensive sampling of diversity at both var and microsatellite loci within a local population consists of a set of 30 single infection isolates from a local population in Papua New Guinea for which we have sequences for a portion of the var DBL\u03b1 domain and the alleles for 12 microsatellite loci ( Barry et al . , 2007; Chen et al . , 2011 ) . Because we expect alleles at the same locus to anti-correlate , and because it is unknown which DBL\u03b1 alleles share a common locus , we only analyze positive correlations . We measure the positive linkage disequilibrium coefficients ( D ) for the presence/absence states for all unique pairs of microsatellite or var DBL\u03b1 alleles . High D values indicate a correlation between alleles within isolates , and they are maximized at intermediate allele frequency ( see and \u2018Materials and methods\u2019 ) . For the var DBL\u03b1 dataset there are 1288 distinct pairs of alleles with positive D values that exceed a two-tailed significance threshold of 0 . 05 ( Hedrick et al . , 1978 ) . Given the number of tests performed , under the null hypothesis of no significant correlations between alleles , we would expect only 310 pairs to exceed this threshold . For the microsatellite dataset there are 146 distinct pairs of alleles with positive D values that exceed the significance threshold and under the null hypothesis we would expect only 49 . Therefore , both datasets show an enrichment of positive correlations among allele pairs , and thus , significant linkage disequilibrium . The D values of the var DBL\u03b1 dataset are higher than those of the microsatellite dataset ( pv<<0 . 0001 by Mann\u2013Whitney test ) , and we argue that this cannot easily be explained by allele frequency differences or differences in the extent of physical linkage among sites ( see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019 ) . Another important observation is that , at least at this level of resolution , var DBL\u03b1 repertoire relatedness is not a function of microsatellite repertoire relatedness . Figure 6E shows the relatedness of the var DBL\u03b1 repertoires of an isolate pair as a function of the relatedness of their microsatellite repertoires . The absence of any correlation suggests the possibility that var DBL\u03b1 variation is shaped by other forces than the neutral demographic forces shaping microsatellite variation . We also consider only the most informative var types in isolation by identifying highly correlated sets of var types . We then tested the relatedness of microsatellite alleles among the isolates containing these networks of correlated var types . The networks of correlated var types were constructed from pairs of var types exhibiting both high linkage disequilibrium and correlation coefficients ( i . e . , D and r ) . Figure 6D represents one of the largest of such fully connected networks ( with D > 0 . 0748 used as the cutoff ) , however this complete network is only observed in two isolates in the dataset . The microsatellite repertoires of these two isolates are less related than average for the whole dataset , so at least in this case , high microsatellite relatedness does not explain the existence of these highly correlated var types . Additionally , smaller subsets of correlated var types are often found in isolates with very dissimilar microsatellite alleles . These results suggest that the existence of highly correlated var types is not always explained by high levels of underlying genome relatedness . Moreover , when we use the same cutoff D value to look for fully connected networks of correlated microsatellite alleles , the largest of such networks comprises only four alleles as opposed to six ( six pairwise connections as compared to 15 ) . Although the sample size of this dataset is too small to identify anything but very strong correlations between intermediate frequency var types ( Brown , 1975 ) , these analyses support a possible role for immune selective forces in structuring the variation at an important class of antigen-encoding loci in P . falciparum . More extensive datasets will be needed for definitive conclusions , but these are now within reach as next generation sequencing methods make it feasible to consider sampling whole communities of parasite genomes to assess var population structure . \n In accordance with predictions from the original \u2018strain theory\u2019 , our model constrains total repertoire diversity to levels that are orders of magnitude lower than is potentially possible given the diversity of the gene pool . This reduction in diversity occurs because coexisting parasites are structured into a few variants with largely discordant repertoires . In a departure from previous strain theory , our model predicts that the different dominant repertoires can exhibit partial overlap; the extent of the overlap increases with transmission intensity and this , in turn , influences observed epidemiological patterns ( particularly age-serology profiles ) . The specific immune profile of each individual host effectively structures the population into distinct sets of \u2018patches\u2019 or \u2018resources\u2019 that define an immune environment , ultimately causing immune selection to act on the parasite population . These distinct sets of patches are formed and conserved even when immunity to the var alleles is shorter-lived . Observations of individuals becoming susceptible to severe infection at later stages of their life ( see for example ( Dhingra et al . , 2010 ) ) , may be in part a consequence of short-lived immunity . Under this assumption , hosts in our model regain protection by exposure to one of the dominant strains circulating in the host population at high frequencies , and do so at a sufficiently high rate to preserve strain population structure except at extremely low transmission intensity . In the event that a host is infected by one of the low frequency genomes that are continuously being introduced ( and equally quickly vanishing ) , it is highly unlikely that this successful transmission event is sufficient for invasion or even replacement of the currently dominating strain community . Discordant repertoires that exhibit partial immunological/antigenic overlap blur the distinction between the acquisition of strictly strain-specific immunity and the acquisition of strictly strain-transcending immunity ( Gupta and Day , 1994a , 1994b ) ( see caption of Figure 5 ) . This underscores the role of strain diversity structure , rather than diversity per se , in determining observed epidemiological patterns and their response to intervention . By reducing antigenic overlap between strains , vector control efforts will result in infection at an older age and a more gradual acquisition of protection to infection , even in the absence of changes in var gene diversity . The model in its current form does not differentiate infection from clinical disease , thus we cannot explicitly address the impact of control on the severity of symptoms . However , if the number of var genes that a host has previously encountered relates to the degree of protection against clinical disease , we would expect more severe symptoms to occur at younger ages under high transmission settings , and in contrast , more homogeneous malaria incidents are likely to occur over a broader range of age-classes when transmission is lowered ( Figure 4D ) . Investigation of these patterns awaits the formulation of models that include functional , non-antigenic , differences between strains , as well as more empirical understanding of the role played by var genes associated with more severe disease . Future work should thus extend our model to consider functional , non-antigen-encoding differences between var genes ( Bull et al . , 1999; Miller et al . , 2002; Scherf et al . , 2008; Buckee et al . , 2009; Claessens et al . , 2012; Severins et al . , 2012 for an example of a recent model applied to questions on the evolution of virulence ) . Ultimately , ways to represent the effects of pathogen diversity implicitly within a standard epidemiological framework , that might also be more easily parameterized , should also be investigated . The goal of malaria eradication is to reduce the reservoir of malaria infection in humans to zero . Chen et al . ( 2011 ) have pointed to the importance of var genes in malaria surveillance , due to their influence on both the duration of infection and the degree of superinfection , and they demonstrated the existence of an immense diversity of var genes and limited var repertoire overlap in Africa , even in sites with low malaria prevalence . Consequently , they have proposed that var typing be used to complement prevalence measures for molecular surveillance of malaria control and elimination efforts . Our models support this proposal as they show that decreasing transmission provokes nonlinear changes in the dominant var configurations . Importantly , our results demonstrate that there is not a simple relationship between var diversity and repertoire diversity . Indeed , the \u2018var strain\u2019 model suggests that vector control strategies that reduce transmission will not always drastically reduce var gene diversity , because a reservoir of parasite genomes with diverse ( highly non-overlapping ) var repertoires will remain . This insight from the model provides a plausible explanation for why it is so difficult to eliminate malaria: non-overlapping var diversity will create significant inherent difficulties in reducing the potential of the malaria parasite to reinfect the same hosts . It also suggests that var surveillance might provide a good molecular means of evaluating control . If the end game is to be achieved in malaria control , then the mechanisms creating and maintaining antigenic diversity warrant further investigation in both modeling and empirical studies . In conclusion , the results of our model on the dynamics of population structure in P . falciparum as defined by the var multi-gene family , have broad implications for the possible emergence of similar structure in many important human and animal pathogens that have major surface antigens encoded by multigene families , including bacterial , protozoan and fungal pathogens ( Deitsch et al . , 2009 ) . \n Each parasite is composed of a set of exactly g var genes , and the genomes are distinguishable from each other by their unique var combination . The overall diversity of var genes circulating in the host population is assumed to originate from a general predefined pool of G variants ( Barry et al . , 2007; Chen et al . , 2011; Recker et al . , 2011 ) . Hence , the total number of distinct var repertoires is G ! / ( G-g ) ! . In the beginning of a simulation we generate five random repertoires by sampling variants from this pool , and we infect 10 random hosts with each of these repertoires . The size of the overall host population is H . Throughout the simulation , variants from this pool are sampled , either by the mutation of one var gene to another , at probability \u03c8 , or through an immigration event , where at rate \u03b6 a random host in the population is infected by a var repertoire randomly sampled from this pool . While mitotic recombination within var genes may play an important role in generating additional var diversity , we do not explicitly include this process here , because for the purposes of this model , and given the high levels of diversity already present in the pool , it would play a role essentially equivalent to mutation or immigration . All our results are robust to variation in these two parameters . During the course of an infection , a parasite expresses all of its var genes , and these are responsible for encoding PfEMP1 variant surface antigens ( VSAs ) ( Gupta et al . , 1994; Miller et al . , 2002; Scherf et al . , 2008; Tibayrenc and Ayala , 2002 ) . After the host is exposed to each of these VSAs , it gains life-long immunity that is specific to each of the antigens ( Bull et al . , 1998; Recker et al . , 2011 ) . We assume that the total duration of infection in a susceptible host lasts a fixed time ( \u03bayrs . ) , and that in partially immune hosts , the actual duration decreases proportionally to the number of var genes that have been expressed in earlier infections ( Bruce et al . , 2000a , 2000b; Giha et al . , 2000 ) . It is recognized that the gain of immunity during the course of an infection is gradual ( Ewers , 1972; Miller et al . , 1994 ) , and we capture this feature by considering that the var genes composing an infecting parasite are mutually and exclusively expressed in a fixed sequential order . Hence , at each stage of an infection , the host has already acquired specific immunity to all the VSA's encoded by var genes expressed up to that point in time . As a result , immunity to each infecting parasite is gained gradually . The infection history of each host is tracked in time and determines its immune status ( Bull et al . , 1999; Bruce et al . , 2000a , 2000b; Giha et al . , 2000; Buckee et al . , 2009; Doolan et al . , 2009 ) . This effectively structures the population of hosts into distinct sets of individual \u2018patches\u2019 or \u2018resources\u2019 that define an immune environment , which ultimately causes immune selection to act on the parasite population . The specific rules of infection constitute a static within-host sub-model and an implicit representation of within-host dynamics , which allowed us to implement the population transmission model without explicitly representing the mechanisms that give rise to the sequential expression of different VSAs within the host . As addressed in the main text , these mechanisms remain poorly understood , although multiple within-host models for sequential waves of parasitaemia have been developed ( Frank , 1999; Recker et al . , 2004; Frank and Barbour , 2006 ) . An infected host can harbor multiple simultaneously co-infecting parasite genomes , and each has the potential of being transmitted to another host through a mosquito biting event . When such an event takes place , each of the infecting parasites has a probability , \u03c4 , of successfully being transmitted from the infected host to the mosquito , making it possible for several different genomes to be transmitted in a single biting event ( see Figure 7A ) . However , in our model we assume that the actual transmission probability of each of the genomes , is divided by the total number of co-infecting genomes at the time of the biting event . Therefore , in effect , there is a cost to co-infection that is consistent with empirical evidence for a density-dependent regulating mechanism on parasite abundance within the host ( Bruce et al . , 2000a , 2000b; Bruce and Day , 2002 , 2003 ) ( see Figure 7B ) . To demonstrate the robustness of our results under different assumptions of the within-host representation , we also considered four alternative rules governing the dynamics of co-infection . For these different rules we find similar results to those presented here . The alternative rules for within host dynamics of multiple infections are: ( 1 ) Co-infection , no cost: during the course of co-infection , there is no cost on the transmission probability of each of the infecting genomes , and hence the transmissibility of each remains , \u03c4 , identical to what it would be , had there been no other infecting genomes . ( 2 ) Co-infection , full cost: during the course of co-infection , the transmissibility of the earliest infecting genome is not compromised by the later infections and stands at \u03c4 , all later infections are not transmissible . When the earliest infection is cleared it is the next one that becomes fully transmissible . ( 3 ) Mutually exclusive infections: here , co-infections are not permitted; while a host is infected with one infection , it is not susceptible to any other . ( 4 ) Delayed super-infection: a host can harbor multiple parasite genomes , but only one actively infects the host , with transmissibility \u03c4 , while the rest remain latent until the active parasite genome is cleared . After that , one of the latent parasite genomes begins its active state until it is cleared , and so on . 10 . 7554/eLife . 00093 . 009Figure 7 . Diagrams showing processes that take place during the course of a simulation: ( A ) in a biting event , there is likeliness that multiple parasite genomes will be transmitted simultaneously . In these events , at probability \u03c1 , the genomes recombine to create new parasite genome variants , which then infect the receiving host . ( B ) A sketch of the rules governing the dynamics of infection and co-infection . By sequentially expressing different var genes during the course of an infection , host immunity is gradually gained to the PfEMP1 variants ( VSA's ) associated with the infecting parasite genome . When the host is exposed to an additional genome , this parasite begins expressing its var genes sequentially , as it would , had it been infecting the host on its own . Transmissibility of each of the infecting parasites during such periods of co-infection decreases according to the multiplicity of infection at the time . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 00093 . 009 Because the model is stochastic and formulated in continuous time , the implementation of the numerical simulations relies on the well-known Gillespie algorithm ( Gillespie , 1977 ) for three of the processes; biting ( responsible for transmission ) , host death , and immigration of new parasite genomes , whose respective rates are b , \u03b1 , and \u03b6 . The algorithm considers that these processes are Poisson and determines , based on these rates , the timing of each of these events . We further consider that the population size is constant in time , such that in the case of a death , a new susceptible host is born , replacing the previous host that died . We assume that this new host has no history of exposure , nor any acquired immunity . At a \u2018biting event\u2019 , a vector bites two randomly chosen hosts sequentially , if the first host is actively infected by one or several parasite genomes at that time , there is a probability for each of these to be transmitted to the second host . As noted earlier , this probability depends on transmission probability , \u03c4 , and on the number of co-infecting parasite genomes . A parasite genome that is transmitted from one host to another , has a probability \u03c8 of mutating , such that one of its randomly chosen var genes is replaced by a randomly chosen variant from the pool . This new genome is then the one transmitted to the second host . When two or more parasite genomes are successfully transmitted from the first host to a mosquito , there is a given probability , \u03c1 , that recombination occurs , resulting in a new var repertoire that is then transmitted from the mosquito to the second host . In this case , the novel combination is formed by randomly sampling a subset of var genes from each of the parent repertoires . Hence , when \u03c1>0 , this effectively leads to a continuous reshuffling of var repertoires circulating in the host population . Given the extensive number of possible var combinations , these recombination events often introduce de novo parasite genomes not yet present in the infected host population . Epidemiologically , after the introduction of a de novo genome , this parasite may successfully be transmitted multiple times , possibly leading to an epidemic , and persisting in the host population for extended periods of time . Alternatively , however , it may be unsuccessful in its transmission , persisting only for a short duration of time before stochastically going extinct . In our numerical experiments , we consider different levels of transmission intensity by specifically varying the biting rate . Thus , throughout the paper , variation in transmission intensity refers to variation in this parameter ( and therefore , in the so-called entomological inoculation rate , or EIR ) . R* is calculated using Simpson's Diversity index , R*=1/\u2211i=1Spi2 , where S is the number of unique genomes responsible for transmission events in a window of time , and pi is their relative proportion . The benefit of using Simpson's index over alternative diversity indices is that it has low sensitivity to species at low abundance ( in this case genomes ) , and gives most weight to the most abundant ones . This is appropriate in our case as we are aiming to identify the number of dominating unique genomes , and are not interested in the general richness ( S ) , which in our case can be immense . The calculation of F* is also based on Simpson's Diversity index , with a focus on the distribution of genes between transmission events , such that: F*=\u2211j=1G ( 1/\u2211i=1Spi2 ) /G . As before , S is the number of unique genomes responsible for transmission events in a window of time , and for each gene i from the gene pool , pi is its relative frequency in each of the transmitted genomes . Hence , a gene that is not shared between dominating genomes will be represented at high frequency at a single genome ( and the diversity will be close to 1 ) . In contrast , the frequency of a gene that is shared by two dominating genomes will be split between both those two ( and the diversity will be close to 2 ) . We then average the degree of overlap between all genes . Because DBL\u03b1 is the only domain found in nearly all PfEMP1 variants ( Miller et al . , 2002 ) , the sequence encoding the central portion of this domain provides the most informative molecular marker of var gene diversity ( Freitas-Junior et al . , 2000; Taylor et al . , 2000; Barry et al . , 2007; Chen et al . , 2011 ) . Two DBL\u03b1 tags are considered to represent two distinct var \u2018types\u2019 if their nucleotide sequence identity is less than 96% . Microsatellites offer an ideal and practical means to construct a null hypothesis reflecting the demographic forces shaping diversity because these sites are predominantly neutral , and their diversity can be explained by a mechanism unrelated to immune selection ( i . e . , slippage ) . In contrast , single nucleotide polymorphisms or single feature polymorphisms , because they are predominantly found in multi-copy antigenic genes in P . falciparum ( Jiang et al . , 2008 ) , do not offer a good basis for a null hypothesis . Relatedness is defined as the number of var types shared between two isolates , divided by the average number of var types identified per isolate for that pair of isolates . D is maximized when allele frequencies are 0 . 5 , so D also indicates the amount of information upon which the coefficient is based ( e . g . , if two alleles appear only once and in the same isolate , their D will be low despite the fact that they are in perfect correlation with one another ) . The higher D values for var DBL\u03b1 alleles versus microsatellite alleles cannot be attributed to differences in allele frequencies since the var DBL\u03b1 alleles have lower frequencies than the microsatellite alleles , and thus , D values biased to lower magnitudes . While the higher D values from the var DBL\u03b1 dataset could be due to the influence of the close physical linkage of a small subset of pairs of var loci ( Deitsch and Hviid , 2004 ) , it seems somewhat unlikely because the great majority of var loci are located very far from other var loci in the 3D7 genome ( Deitsch and Hviid , 2004 ) , and var loci have been shown to coincide with recombination hotspots ( Mu et al . , 2010; Jiang et al . , 2011 ) in a genome that is already characterized by remarkably high underlying rates of recombination ( Conway et al . , 1999; Volkman et al . , 2006 ) .", "headings": ["Abstract", "Introduction", "Results", "Discussion", "Materials and methods"], "keywords": ["microbiology and infectious disease"], "id": "elife-00093-v1"}
{"lay_summary": "Shigella is a highly infectious group of bacteria that attack the human digestive tract , causing severe and often deadly diarrhoea , especially in children . There is currently no vaccine to protect against the disease , and some strains are also now resistant to antibiotics . People get infected by eating or drinking contaminated foods and water . After passing through the stomach , Shigella invades and then multiplies in the lining of the intestine , eventually causing tissue damage and irritation . During this process , Shigella \u2018hides\u2019 from its host\u2019s immune system by blocking how intestinal cells respond to infection . Normally , infected cells send out chemical signals that act like a call for help , attracting specialised immune cells to clear the infection . In intestinal cells , two proteins called UBC13 and TRAF6 work together to switch on this response . Specifically , TRAF6 needs to bind to UBC13 for the switch to turn on . Like many proteins , UBC13 is formed of thousands of atoms; some of these are organized in \u2018functional groups\u2019 , a collection of atoms joined in a specific manner and with special chemical properties . During Shigella infection , the bacteria produce an enzyme that changes a single functional group ( an amino group ) at a specific location within UBC13 for a different one ( an hydroxyl group ) . Previous research showed that this could stop the immune response in intestinal cells , but the mechanism remained unknown . Mohanty et al . therefore set out to determine exactly how a change of so few atoms could have such a dramatic effect . Biochemical studies using purified proteins revealed that Shigella\u2019s alteration to UBC13 did not change its overall structure . However , the altered protein could no longer bind to its partner TRAF6 . Theoretical analysis and computer simulations revealed that the normal binding process relies on a positively charged amino acid ( one of the protein\u2019s building blocks ) in UBC13 and a negatively charged one in TRAF6 being attracted to each other . Shigella\u2019s substitution , however , introduces a second negatively charged amino acid in UBC13 . This \u2018steals\u2019 the positively charged amino acid that would normally interact with TRAF6: the electrical attraction between the two proteins is disrupted , and this stops them from binding . The work by Mohanty et al . reveals the exact mechanism Shigella uses to dampen its host\u2019s immune response during infection . In the future , this knowledge could be used to develop more effective drugs that would help control outbreaks of diarrhoea .", "article": "The deamidase OspI from enteric bacteria Shigella flexneri deamidates a glutamine residue in the host ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBC13 and converts it to glutamate ( Q100E ) . Consequently , its polyubiquitination activity in complex with the RING-finger ubiquitin ligase TRAF6 and the downstream NF-\u03baB inflammatory response is silenced . The precise role of deamidation in silencing the UBC13/TRAF6 complex is unknown . We report that deamidation inhibits the interaction between UBC13 and TRAF6 RING-domain ( TRAF6RING ) by perturbing both the native and transient interactions . Deamidation creates a new intramolecular salt-bridge in UBC13 that competes with a critical intermolecular salt-bridge at the native UBC13/TRAF6RING interface . Moreover , the salt-bridge competition prevents transient interactions necessary to form a typical UBC13/RING complex . Repulsion between E100 and the negatively charged surface of RING also prevents transient interactions in the UBC13/RING complex . Our findings highlight a mechanism wherein a post-translational modification perturbs the conformation and stability of transient complexes to inhibit protein-protein association . \n Several bacterial pathogens secrete effector proteins that inhibit or co-opt the Ubiquitin ( Ub ) pathway to suppress the immune response of the host cell ( Ashida et al . , 2014 ) . The human pathogenic bacteria Shigella flexneri inactivates the host inflammatory Nf-\u03baB signaling , responsible for inducing inflammatory cytokine responses during pathogen invasion ( Sanada et al . , 2012 ) . In the early events of interleukin-dependent activation of Nf-\u03baB signaling , the Ub-conjugating enzyme UBC13 , and the Ub-ligase TRAF6 function together to synthesize both unanchored polyubiquitin chains , and anchored polyubiquitin chains on TRAF6 and its substrate NEMO ( Chen , 2005 ) . These chains serve as a scaffold to bring together TAK1/2 and IKK kinases , eventually leading to phosphorylation and activation of the IKK kinases , I\u03baB degradation and nuclear translocation of transcription factor Nf-\u03baB . To inactivate Nf-\u03baB signaling , Shigella flexneri secretes a Type III effector called OspI , which functions as a deamidase ( Sanada et al . , 2012 ) . OspI specifically targets a glutamine residue in UBC13 and converts it to glutamate ( Q100E ) . Ubiquitination reactions of TRAF6 either with UBC13 in the presence of OspI or with mutant Q100E-UBC13 ( dUBC13 ) show a significant drop in polyubiquitination activity ( Sanada et al . , 2012 ) . However , the mechanism underlying inhibition of polyubiquitination by deamidation of UBC13 remains unclear . Ubiquitination is a eukaryotic post-translational modification ( Komander and Rape , 2012 ) , wherein the last glycine residue in the C-terminal tail of Ubiquitin ( Ub ) is activated and covalently attached to a substrate lysine residue . Ubiquitination involves three steps: an initial activation and thioester conjugation by the Ubiquitin-activating enzyme ( E1 ) , followed by the thioester conjugation to the Ubiquitin-conjugating ( E2 ) enzymes , and a final step in which the Ub is covalently attached to the substrate amino group . The last step is typically catalyzed by a class of Ubiquitin ligases ( E3 ) , which contain either a RING ( Really Interesting New Gene ) -finger domain , U-box domain or HECT domain ( Metzger et al . , 2012 ) . The RING-finger/U-box domain stabilizes a catalytic-closed conformation of the flexible E2\u00a0~Ub species and drastically enhances the rate of Ub conjugation to substrates ( Dou et al . , 2012; Plechanovov\u00e1 et al . , 2012; Pruneda et al . , 2012 ) . The E2 UBC13 functions with several RING-finger E3s like TRAF6 to synthesize K63-linked poly-Ub chains that function to activate DNA repair or immune response ( Fukushima et al . , 2007 ) . Apart from the E3s , UBC13 also binds a co-factor MMS2 , which does not activate UBC13 but maintains the linkage specificity of the poly-Ub chains synthesized by UBC13 ( Branigan et al . , 2015 ) . In this study , we have investigated the mechanisms underlying the inactivation of UBC13 upon deamidation using NMR spectroscopy , molecular dynamics ( MD ) simulations , and in-vitro ubiquitination assays . We report that deamidation weakens the non-covalent interaction of UBC13 with RING-finger domain of TRAF6 ( TRAF6RING ) , without perturbing UBC13 structure or the intrinsic enzymatic activity of UBC13 . However , the underlying cause of reduced interaction is nonintuitive since Q100 is in the vicinity of UBC13/TRAF6RING interface but does not form any contact with the TRAF6RING . Further studies showed that deamidation disrupts the interaction between UBC13 and TRAF6RING by three mechanisms: i ) A new intramolecular R14/E100 salt-bridge appears in dUBC13 , which competes with a critical intermolecular salt-bridge in the native complex , ii ) the salt-bridge competition also perturbs the UBC13/TRAF6RING transient complexes to inhibit association , and iii ) transient repulsion between the negatively charged E100 and the negatively charged interface of TRAF6RING reduces association between UBC13 and TRAF6RING . The effect of each mechanism on the binding was confirmed by binding studies using appropriate substitutions in either UBC13 or TRAF6RING . The impact of deamidation on transient interactions was also observed using another RING domain from RNF38 , indicating that the mechanism could be ubiquitous for UBC13/RING complexes . Our study highlights that deamidation of residues that do not directly participate in the E2/E3 interaction but are close to the interface can effectively modulate the interaction by perturbing the native and transient intermolecular contacts . The mechanism of regulating protein-protein transient interactions by post-translational modifications could be at play in other quintessential signaling pathways . \n Two different constructs of TRAF6 was used in this study . The isolated RING domain TRAF6RING ( aa: 50\u2013124 ) was a shorter construct . The longer construct included the RING domain and three ZF domains ( TRAF6RZ3 , aa: 50\u2013211 ) . TRAF6RING interacts with UBC13 and with the donor Ub in the UBC13\u00a0~Ub conjugate , while the interaction of ZF domains with donor Ub further stabilized the complex ( Middleton et al . , 2017 ) . dUBC13 had reduced polyubiquitination activity than UBC13 , either with longer TRAF6RZ3 or with shorter TRAF6RING ( Figure 1A and B ) . Deamidation could have some allosteric effect at the active site or Ub-binding site , which may deactivate UBC13 . However , a comparison of the extent of polyubiquitination by the UBC13/MMS2 heterodimer in the absence of E3 was similar between UBC13 and dUBC13 , indicating that E2 activity is not altered upon deamidation ( Figure 1C ) . Deamidation could misfold UBC13 or inhibit the interaction between UBC13 and TRAF6RING . These possibilities were examined by studying the impact of deamidation on the structure of UBC13 and its interaction with TRAF6RING . 15N-labeled UBC13 , dUBC13 , and unlabelled TRAF6RING were expressed in E . coli and purified . Unlabelled TRAF6RING was titrated into a sample of 15N-UBC13 , and the binding was detected by 15N-edited Heteronuclear Single Quantum Coherence ( HSQC ) NMR experiments ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . Perturbations due to the altered chemical environment upon ligand binding induce changes in the chemical shift of the backbone amide resonances . The chemical shift perturbations ( CSP ) plotted in Figure 1D shows that the significant perturbations in UBC13 occur in the \u03b11-helix , and the loop between \u03b13-10 and \u03b12-helix , which is the canonical UBC13 interface in the complex ( Figure 1G and H ) . The resonance shifts can be plotted against the ligand: protein concentration , and fit to yield the dissociation constant ( Kd ) of interaction . The peak shifts in UBC13 titration spectra were fitted to yield a Kd of 0 . 39 ( \u00b10 . 04 ) mM ( Figure 1I and Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B ) . Backbone amide chemical shifts can report if the protein\u2019s fold is affected by the substitution/modification of a residue . The backbone chemical shifts of UBC13 and dUBC13 resonances were compared . The amide CSPs between UBC13 and dUBC13 indicated that apart from the residues immediately next to Q100 in sequence , only R14 and L15 of the N-terminal \u03b11-helix are affected upon Q100E substitution ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A ) . The absence of major CSPs in the rest of dUBC13 indicated that deamidation did not change the fold of UBC13 . Moreover , analysis of the backbone and C\u03b2 chemical shifts in dUBC13 confirmed that the secondary structure was unperturbed ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2B ) . Unlabelled TRAF6RING was then titrated into a sample of 15N-dUBC13 , and the binding was detected by 15N-edited HSQC experiments ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3 ) . Negligible peak shifts were detected in dUBC13 even when the TRAF6RING was titrated up to 6-fold higher than dUBC13 , indicating that TRAF6RING does not bind dUBC13 ( Figure 1E\u2013H ) . A rough estimate of the Kd was obtained by comparing the CSPs at the UBC13 interface at the same protein: ligand concentration between UBC13 and dUBC13 , which suggested the Kd of 6 . 34 ( \u00b12 . 6 ) mM . If the reduced affinity is precisely due to the negative charge at residue 100 , then substitution of Q100 with a neutral amino acid should not affect the affinity of the complex . TRAF6RING was titrated to Q100A-UBC13 , and the measured Kd was 0 . 54 ( \u00b10 . 07 ) mM ( Figure 1I ) , which is similar to UBC13/TRAF6RING . However , when Q100 was substituted with another acidic residue aspartate ( D ) , the affinity dropped significantly ( Kd\u00a0~4 . 6 ( \u00b11 . 8 ) ) mM , Figure 1I ) , confirming that substitution at Q100 with a negatively charged residue inhibited the interaction between UBC13 and TRAF6RING . Altogether , deamidation inhibited the binding of TRAF6RING to UBC13 , but neither changed the fold of UBC13 nor its intrinsic E2 activity . In the UBC13/TRAF6RING native complex structure , Q100 does not form any direct contact with TRAF6RING ( Figure 2A ) . Hence , the mechanism underlying reduced binding due to deamidation of Q100 is nonintuitive . The surface electrostatic potentials calculated for UBC13 and TRAF6RING indicated charge complementarity at the interface ( Figure 3A ) . The UBC13 interface was positively charged , while the TRAF6RING was negatively charged . Notably , Q100 lies in the vicinity of a network of electrostatic interactions involving helix-1 of UBC13 ( R6 and R14 ) and the first zinc-coordination motif ( D57 and E69 ) of the TRAF6RING ( Figure 2A ) . Possibly , the introduction of an additional negative charge in UBC13 upon deamidation could perturb the interfacial electrostatic contacts to disrupt the interaction . A conventional MD simulation ( 200 ns ) of free dUBC13 was performed to investigate if deamidation alters any electrostatic interactions within UBC13 . Interestingly , an intramolecular salt-bridge was observed between R14 and E100 in dUBC13 ( Figure 2B ) , which correlates well with the backbone chemical shift perturbations observed at R14 upon deamidation ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A ) . The new salt-bridge involving R14 and E100 in dUBC13 was further investigated by NMR . 15N-edited HSQCs of the Arginine N\u03b5-H\u03b5 groups were collected for both UBC13 and dUBC13 , which showed shifted resonances for the arginine sidechains ( R7 , R14 , and R102 ) around residue E100 , indicating that these sidechain conformations are perturbed ( Figure 2C ) . Unfortunately , the 1H\u03b7 atoms are invisible in the NMR spectra due to chemical exchange with the solvent at physiological pH , and millisecond timescale rotations around the C\u03b6-N\u03b7/C\u03b6-N\u03b5 bonds ( Figure 2D ) . Hence , detection of arginine sidechain-mediated interactions ( hydrogen bonds and salt-bridges ) through 1H\u03b7 atoms is difficult . However , such interactions can be inferred from the reduced mobility of their sidechains observed in 15N\u03b7/\u03b5 ( F1 ) -13C\u03b6 ( F2 ) correlation spectra ( Yoshimura et al . , 2017 ) . For example , R85 forms salt-bridge with D81 in UBC13 , which reduces the sidechain mobility of R85 sidechain and gives rise to two separate resonances for R85 N\u03b7 atoms in the 15N\u03b5/\u03b7-13C\u03b6 correlation spectra ( Figure 2E ) . The side-chains of free arginines rotate faster and their corresponding N\u03b7 atoms have a single averaged resonance in the spectra ( Figure 2E ) . The R14 N\u03b7 atoms had two separate resonances in dUBC13 but not UBC13 ( Figure 2F , expanded in 2G ) , implying that R14 forms a new intramolecular salt-bridge in dUBC13 , consistent with the MD simulations . The salt-bridge persisted in the Q100D-UBC13 ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1 ) , correlating well with its reduced affinity for TRAF6RING . At the interface of UBC13/TRAF6RING , R14 of UBC13 forms an intermolecular salt-bridge with E69 of TRAF6RING ( Figure 2A ) . The deamidation-induced intramolecular R14/E100 salt-bridge may interfere with the intermolecular R14/E69 salt-bridge to destabilize the complex . Conventional MD simulations were performed with both wild type ( wt ) and deamidated complex to test this hypothesis . The stability of the complex was determined by the rmsd of TRAF6RING with respect to the crystal structure , where higher rmsd implied instability . The wt complex was stable throughout the 200 ns trajectory with low rmsd ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2A ) . The deamidated complex was unstable for a significant duration of 75 ns , wherein the rmsd of TRAF6RING increased substantially ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2B ) . Five interfacial contacts were chosen as reporters of the interaction between UBC13 and TRAF6RING ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . Among them , three were electrostatic ( Figure 2A and Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2A ) , and the rest were hydrophobic ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2D ) . The other interfacial contacts were mostly unstable in simulations and were omitted from our analysis ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2G and H ) . No major instability was observed in the hydrophobic contacts between UBC13 and dUBC13 ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2E and F ) . However , concurrent to the high rmsd in dUBC13 complex , the R14/E69 intermolecular salt-bridge disrupted and the R14/E100 intramolecular salt-bridge formed , suggesting that salt-bridge competition might destabilize the native dUBC13 complex ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2B , Video 1 ) . The occupancy of the R14/E69 intermolecular salt-bridge dropped from 99% in the wt complex to 40% in the dUBC13 complex ( Supplementary file 1-table\u00a0S1 ) . The Umbrella Sampling ( US ) method was used to estimate the stability of the deamidated complex ( Figure 3 ) . The US method quantifies the energy required ( \u0394GPMF ) to form the native complex . An unstable complex is associated with higher energy . As a control , US simulations were performed on the Barnase/Barstar complex ( Table 1 and Supplementary file 1-table\u00a0S2 , Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A ) . The PMF profile and \u0394GPMF of the complex are consistent with its high stability ( Hoefling and Gottschalk , 2010;\u00a0Wang et al . , 2010 ) . The US simulations were then carried out for wt , dUBC13 , Q100A-UBC13 , and R14A-UBC13 complexes ( Table 1 , Supplementary file 1-table\u00a0S2 , Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B ) . The PMF profile of wt complex decreased sharply by 2 . 0 kcal/mol at\u00a03 . 5\u00a0nm\u00a0and subsequently plateaued ( Figure 3B ) . The sharp drop in the PMF profile of the wt complex was due to attractive electrostatic interactions , which were absent in the other complexes ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C and D ) . In contrast , \u0394GPMF of dUBC13 complex gradually reduced by only 0 . 7 kcal/mol , suggesting that deamidation reduces the stability of the complex . The difference in \u0394GPMF between the deamidated and wt complex , \u0394\u0394GPMF\u00a0=\u00a01 . 37 kcal/mol was of the same order as the decrease in binding energy observed by NMR titrations , \u0394\u0394G\u00a0=\u00a01 . 69 kcal/mol ( Figure 1I ) . The \u0394GPMF of Q100A-UBC13/TRAF6RING is similar to the wt complex ( Table 1 ) . The stability of the intermolecular contacts was compared between UBC13 and dUBC13 complexes at the native US window . While the R14/E69 salt-bridge was stable throughout in the wt complex , it disrupted in the dUBC13 complex ( Figure 3C and D , Supplementary file 1-table\u00a0S5 ) . The Coulombic Interaction Energy ( CIE ) is the sum energy of all the electrostatic interactions . Lower CIE values reflect attractive electrostatic interactions . The mean CIE was significantly higher in dUBC13 complex , suggesting that deamidation primarily inhibited electrostatic interactions ( Figure 3F ) . The disruption of R14/E69 salt-bridge temporally correlates well with higher CIE and higher rmsd of TRAF6RING ( Figure 3E and G ) . Interestingly , when the US simulations were repeated with R14A-UBC13 , the \u0394GPMF was insignificant , indicating that R14-mediated interactions are essential for the binding ( Figure 3B ) . Overall , the conventional MD and US simulations indicate that salt-bridge competition may sequester R14 away from the interface and reduce the binding energy of the complex . Steered MD ( SMD ) simulations were performed to capture the effects of deamidation on the dissociation of the UBC13 and dUBC13 complexes . If a complex is unstable , less force and work will be required to dissociate it . Compared to the wt complex , less force and work were required to dissociate the dUBC13 complex , indicating reduced stability due to deamidation ( Figure 4A\u2013C , Table 2 and Supplementary file 1-table\u00a0S3 ) . As TRAF6RING starts to dissociate , the intramolecular R14/E100 salt-bridge competes with the intermolecular R14/E69 salt-bridge and reduces its strength ( Figure 4D , Figure 4\u2014figure supplements 1\u20132 and Supplementary file 1-table\u00a0S4 ) . The R14A-UBC13 complex , where the intermolecular R14/E69 salt-bridge is absent , was also less stable compared to the wt complex ( Table 2 ) . The order in which the contacts disrupted during dissociation was compared in a typical SMD trajectory for both UBC13 and dUBC13 complexes ( Figure 5A and Videos 2 and 3 ) . In the wt complex , whereas the other contacts disrupted early , the R14/E69 intermolecular salt-bridge persisted till the complex dissociated completely ( Figure 5A\u20135C and Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A ) . Since the intermolecular salt-bridge was stable for a long duration in both the conventional and SMD simulations , it could be critical for the wt complex . However , in the trajectory of the dUBC13 complex , the intermolecular salt-bridge disrupted prematurely , and the intramolecular salt-bridge formed simultaneously ( Figure 5D\u20135F and Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B ) . Collectively , SMD suggested that R14/E69 formed a critical interfacial salt-bridge , and as the molecules start to dissociate , the R14/E69 and R14/E100 salt-bridges compete . The competition may contribute to the reduced stability and enhanced dissociation of the dUBC13 complex . A native protein complex forms through an intermediate species commonly referred to as the transient/encounter complex ensemble ( Schreiber et al . , 2009 ) . The transient complexes are formed by long-range electrostatic interactions and have greater oriental freedom compared to the native complex ( Tang et al . , 2006 ) . The effect of negatively charged E100 on the transient complex was estimated based on transient complex theory ( Alsallaq and Zhou , 2008 ) . The method uses the native complex structure to compute its association rate constant ( kon ) from the electrostatic free energy ( \u0394Gel ) of the transient complex ensemble . Position of individual atoms within each input structure remained fixed in transient-complex theory calculations , and hence , the competition between salt-bridges was absent . Therefore , any difference between wt and deamidated complex were solely due to transient repulsion between E100 and the acidic residues of TRAF6RING . The association rate constant of the wt complex reduced at high salt compared to low salt , confirming that electrostatic interactions are important for the association of wt transient complex ( Table 3 ) . The association rate constant reduced by three-fold for dUBC13/TRAF6RING at low salt , indicating that deamidation reduces the association of the transient complex . The difference between wt and dUBC13 complex is nominal at high salt , where the repulsive effects of E100 may be screened . Multiple US windows also indicated repulsive transient interactions between E100 and TRAF6RING ( Figure 6 , Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A ) . The molecular details of the repulsive effect could be observed in a typical US window ( Figure 6 ) . In the wt complex , a transient attractive interaction was observed between R14 in UBC13 and D57 in TRAF6RING ( Figure 6A and C , Supplementary file 1-table\u00a0S5 ) . The wt complex was stable with low rmsd and low CIE values ( Figure 6B\u00a0and\u00a0D ) . However , the R14/D57 interaction was absent in the dUBC13 complex , and it dissociated prematurely ( Figure 6B\u2013D , Supplementary file 1-table\u00a0S5 ) . In the initial timepoints of this trajectory , R14 and E100 simultaneously interacted with D57 ( Figure 6C and E ) . While the R14/D57 interaction was attractive , the E100/D57 interaction was repulsive . The repulsive interaction probably destabilized the attractive interaction , and it disrupted soon after . The complex dissociated subsequently ( Figure 6B ) . The instability of deamidated complex was also evident in other US windows ( Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1B\u2013E ) . Overall , electrostatic repulsion between E100 and the negatively charged interface of TRAF6RING was observed in the dUBC13 transient complexes , which could destabilize it . When the transient complex theory calculations were repeated for the R14A-UBC13 complex , the kon dropped significantly by six-fold at low salt ( Table 3 ) . Since repulsion due to E100 is absent in R14A-UBC13 , the drop in kon suggests that R14 also forms transient contacts with TRAF6 , which are important for the binding . US simulations also suggested that R14-mediated non-native transient interactions promote the association of the wt complex ( Figure 6A ) . Unbiased-association simulations were performed on the complexes to confirm this observation . From these simulations , the probability of association and stability of native-like transient complexes were assessed ( Table 4 ) . Similar to Transcomp calculations ( Table 3 ) , the native-like association of the wt complex was 3-fold higher at low salt than high salt , confirming that formation of the transient complex was dependent on the long-range electrostatic interactions . The association and stability dropped by 2 . 3 fold in the dUBC13 complex at low salt , suggesting that deamidation reduces the formation of the native-like transient complex . The ensemble of transient complexes was compared between UBC13 and dUBC13 ( Figure 7 ) . The distribution of TRAF6RING positions around the helix 1 of UBC13 indicates that the TRAF6RING positions are tightly clustered around the UBC13 binding interface ( Figure 7A ) . The projections of the transient complexes showed that a cluster indeed coincided with the final native complex . The positions of TRAF6RING are dispersed when it interacts with dUBC13 , and none of the clusters coincide with the native complex ( Figure 7B ) . Several TRAF6RING clusters around R14 were absent in the dUBC13 complex , indicating that the transient contacts between R14 and TRAF6RING are absent in dUBC13 ( Figure 7C and D ) . The energy landscape correlating the free-energy with rmsd of TRAF6RING , and the minimum distance between interfaces shows multiple low-energy transient intermediates were present in the association pathway , which converged to the native complex ( Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1A ) . In contrast , a few transient intermediates were present in the dUBC13 complex , and none existed in the native-like conformation ( Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1A ) . The association trajectories were further analyzed to detect native-like complexes , which identified one trajectory at low salt for the wt complex ( Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2A , Figure 8A ) . Here , TRAF6RING associated initially with UBC13 via the R6/D57 and R14/E69 salt-bridges ( Figure 8B , Video 4 ) . Subsequently , the other contacts formed , leading to a stable native complex ( Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1A ) . No native complex was detected for the dUBC13 complex at low salt conditions ( Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2B ) . At higher salt , where deamidation effects are potentially screened , a native-like complex was momentarily observed ( Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2B and Figure 8C , Video 5 ) . Here , a non-native transient R6/E69 salt-bridge and the S96/P106 hydrogen bond formed for a short period . However , the intramolecular R14/E100 salt-bridge was strong , whereas the intermolecular R14/E69 salt-bridge and other contacts were unstable ( Figure 8C and D , and Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1B ) . To summarize , unbiased association simulations indicate that the critical transient contacts formed by R14 were absent in the deamidated complex , presumably due to the salt-bridge competition . The MD simulations suggested that deamidation destabilized both the native and transient complexes . For simplicity , we assumed that the effect of salt-bridge competition on the transient and native complexes , and the repulsive effect of E100 on transient complexes are mutually exclusive . The difference in binding energy due to deamidation ( \u0394\u0394Gd ) is then ( 1 ) \u0394\u0394Gd=\u0394\u0394GNSB+\u0394\u0394GTSB+\u0394\u0394GTrep , where \u0394\u0394GNSB is the difference in binding energy due to salt-bridge competition in the native complex , \u0394\u0394GTSB is due to salt-bridge competition in the transient complex , and \u0394\u0394GTrep is the repulsive effect of E100 on the transient complex . NMR titrations were carried out using variants of UBC13 and TRAF6RING to validate the effect of each mechanism on the binding energy of the complex . E69A-TRAF6RING removed the acceptor of the intermolecular salt-bridge and mimicked the effect of salt-bridge competition in the native complex ( \u0394\u0394GNSB ) . When 15N-UBC13 was titrated with E69A-TRAF6RING , the Kd increased , and binding energy decreased ( Figure 9A ) . The drop in binding energy compared to the wt complex gave the \u0394\u0394GNSB\u00a0=\u00a00 . 82 kcal/mol . The R14A-UBC13 substitution mimicked the salt-bridge competition in both the native and the transient complexes , that\u00a0is the drop in binding energy was \u0394\u0394GNSB + \u0394\u0394GTSB . The titration of R14A-UBC13 with TRAF6RING determined a drop in the binding energy by 1 . 45 kcal/mol ( Figure 9A ) . Given the value of \u0394\u0394GNSB was determined above , \u0394\u0394GTSB\u00a0=\u00a00 . 63 kcal/mol . Deamidation reduced the binding energy by 1 . 69 kcal/mol ( \u0394\u0394Gd , Figure 1I ) . Since \u0394\u0394GNSB + \u0394\u0394GTSB\u00a0=\u00a01 . 45 kcal/mol , \u0394\u0394GTrep\u00a0=\u00a00 . 24 kcal/mol ( Equation 1 ) . The value of \u0394\u0394GTrep agreed well with the repulsive effect calculated by transient complex theory calculations , \u0394\u0394Gel = \u0394GelUBC13 - \u0394GeldUBC13\u00a0=\u00a00 . 34 kcal mol\u22121 ( Table 3 ) . Overall , titrations studies indicated that all three mechanisms have distinct contributions to the binding between UBC13 and TRAF6RING . Analysis of the UBC13/RING structures shows that R14-mediated salt-bridges are common in these complexes ( Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . However , in a few complexes like UBC13/RNF4 and UBC13/RNF8 , the R14 mediated salt-bridge was absent . A typical RING domain from the E3 RNF38 ( RNF38RING , aa: 387\u2013465 ) was chosen to study the effect of UBC13 deamidation in such cases . RNF38RING can activate UBC13 to synthesize polyubiquitin chains ( Figure 9B ) . Similar to TRAF6 , the RNF38RING fails to activate dUBC13 ( Figure 9B ) . Like RNF4 and RNF8 , RNF38RING lacks a negatively charged residue at the region corresponding to E69 in TRAF6RING ( Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 2A\u2013C ) . However , there are several acidic residues in the vicinity , similar to TRAF6RING , which can form non-native transient interactions with UBC13 ( Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 2B and C ) . NMR titrations measured the effect of deamidation on the interaction between UBC13 and RNF38RING . When RNF38RING domain was titrated to 15N-UBC13 ( Figure 9C ) , major CSPs were observed in the \u03b11-helix , \u03b23-\u03b24 loop , and the loop between \u03b13-10 and \u03b11-helix ( Figure 9D and E ) . The Kd value of UBC13/RNF38RING interaction was 0 . 04 mM ( Figure 9I ) . Considerable peaks shifts were also detected when RNF38RING was titrated to 15N-dUBC13 ( Figure 9F ) . However , the CSPs in dUBC13 were reduced compared to UBC13 at the same protein: ligand stoichiometry , indicating reduced affinity ( Figure 9F\u2013H ) . Fitting of peak shifts against ligand: protein ratio yielded the Kd to be 0 . 25 mM , which corresponds to a 6-fold drop in affinity . This could be due to the combination of the salt-bridge competition and repulsive interactions . The backbone chemical shifts of RNF38RING resonances were assigned using 13C , 15N labeled RNF38RING sample , and standard triple resonance NMR experiments . The interface of RNF38RING was mapped by titrating unlabeled UBC13 to 15N-labeled RNF38RING ( Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 2D ) . Using the CSPs of UBC13 and RNF38RING , an NMR-data driven structural model of UBC13/RNF38RING was determined by HADDOCK ( Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 2E ) . The structure showed that in the absence of a negative charged salt-bridge acceptor , R14 makes van der Waals contacts with M417 ( Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 2F ) . The R14A substitution reduces the binding energy of the native complex by 0 . 2 kcal/mol ( Vangone and Bonvin , 2015 ) , indicating it is not a hot-spot in this complex . The titration was repeated with R14A-UBC13 , which mimics the R14 sequestration by salt-bridge competition . The Kd of R14A-UBC13/RNF38RING showed a 2 . 5-fold increase and reduced binding energy by 0 . 6 kcal/mol . Since the effect of R14A substitution on the native complex is 0 . 2 kcal/mol , the effect on the transient complex is 0 . 4 kcal/mol . Deamidation reduces the binding energy by 1 . 1 kcal/mol ( Figure 9I ) . Given the salt-bridge competition reduces binding energy by 0 . 6 kcal/mol , the repulsive effect of E100 on the transient complex is 0 . 5 kcal/mol . Overall , the effect of deamidation on perturbing the ensemble of transient complexes was verified in another RING domain , which indicated that the mechanism could be ubiquitous in UBC13/RING complexes . If the RING domains bind weakly to dUBC13 , their ability to activate the dUBC13\u00a0~Ub conjugate should be compromised , which was tested by binding and activity assays . First , the conjugation of donor Ub to the UBC13 and dUBC13 were compared by an in-vitro conjugation reaction . Both the UBC13 and dUBC13 conjugated with the donor Ub with similar efficiency , indicating that deamidation does not hamper E2\u00a0~Ub conjugation ( Figure 10A and Figure 10\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . In the UBC13\u00a0~Ub/TRAF6RZ3 complex , the RING domain and ZF1 domain makes additional contacts with donor Ub to stabilize the complex further . These contacts could rescue the loss in affinity between UBC13 and RING domain upon deamidation . Hence , the binding of UBC13\u00a0~Ub and dUBC13\u00a0~Ub to TRAF6RZ3 was compared . While UBC13\u00a0~Ub conjugate bound to TRAF6RZ3 , dUBC13\u00a0~Ub conjugate failed to do so ( Figure 10B and Figure 10\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . In a similar experiment , UBC13\u00a0~Ub but not dUBC13\u00a0~Ub bound to RNF38RING ( Figure 10C ) . Altogether , the binding experiments confirmed that secondary interactions between Ub/RING or Ub/ZF1 could not compensate for the loss of primary interaction between UBC13 and RING . The activation of UBC13\u00a0~\u00a0Ub conjugates by the RING domains were measured by the kinetics of single-round Ub discharge from the UBC13\u00a0~\u00a0Ub . UBC13 ( or dUBC13 ) was first conjugated with K63A-Ub . Then the conjugation reaction was quenched , followed by the addition of Mms2 , RING domains , and free Lysine . TRAF6RING could effectively discharge Ub from UBC13\u00a0~\u00a0Ub , but not from dUBC13\u00a0~\u00a0Ub ( Figure 10D , G , H ) . Similarly , RNF38RING could discharge Ub from UBC13\u00a0~\u00a0Ub but not from dUBC13\u00a0~\u00a0Ub ( Figure 10E , I , J ) . When the concentration of the RNF38RING was increased by five-fold to compensate for the reduced affinity of dUBC13/RING complex , the rate of Ub discharge improved , which confirmed that the cause of the inefficient discharge is the reduced affinity of dUBC13/RING interaction ( Figure 10K and F ) . The lysine of the acceptor Ub at the growing end of a poly-Ub chain ( either unanchored or anchored on a substrate ) , attacks the E2\u00a0~Ub active site to transfer the donor Ub . The kinetics of single-round di-Ubiquitin ( Ub2 ) synthesis was monitored to investigate if the deamidation of UBC13 affects the activity of UBC13 and its interaction with acceptor lysine at the active site . Here the lysine of the acceptor Ub mimics the acceptor lysine of growing poly-Ub chain . UBC13 ( or dUBC13 ) was conjugated with donor K63A-Ub . Then Mms2 , RNF38RING and acceptor D77-Ub was added in the reaction mix , which was then monitored over time to detect the synthesis of Ub2 . The rate of Ub2 synthesis was rapid for UBC13 but slow for dUBC13 ( Figure 10L ) . Kinetic analysis indicated that the reaction rate for the dUBC13/RING complex is similar to the rate of UBC13 in the absence of RING ( Figure 10M and Figure 10\u2014figure supplement 2 ) , indicating that the catalytic effect of RING is absent in the dUBC13/RING complex . A comparison of the kinetic parameters between UBC13 and dUBC13 indicated that deamidation does not significantly affect the Km of the substrate , but drastically affects the Kcat of the reaction ( Figure 10N and Figure 10\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . This confirms that the area around the active site is not perturbed by deamidation , as was observed by NMR ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . Furthermore , in the absence of a RING domain , the Kcat of UBC13 and dUBC13 is similar , confirming that the catalytic activity of UBC13 is unaffected upon deamidation , similar to the observation of Figure 1C . However , unlike UBC13 , the Kcat of dUBC13 does not increase in the presence of RING , confirming that RING domains fail to bind and activate the dUBC13\u00a0~Ub conjugate . \n Protein deamidation can have significant functional consequences for innate immune signaling ( Zhao et al . , 2016 ) , which justifies its emergence as a powerful tool employed by pathogenic bacteria to suppress the immune response ( Washington et al . , 2013 ) . However , little is known about the molecular mechanism underlying deactivation of immune signaling by deamidation . The Shigella flexneri effector OspI suppresses the inflammatory response ( NF-\u03baB pathway ) via deamidation of UBC13 at Q100 . By an unknown mechanism , deamidation of Q100 to E100 inhibits the synthesis of K63-linked polyubiquitin chains by the UBC13/TRAF6 complex , preventing the downstream activation of NF-\u03baB pathway . Q100 is present at the vicinity of UBC13/TRAF6 interface but does not form direct contact with TRAF6 . We report that deamidation neither alters the fold nor the enzymatic activity of UBC13 . NMR and kinetics studies indicate that deamidation does not alter the active site of UBC13 . Instead , it reduces the interaction between UBC13 and RING domains to diminish the catalytic effect of the RING . The interaction with TRAF6 is inhibited because E100 in dUBC13 competes with an intermolecular R14/E69 salt-bridge at the dUBC13/TRAF6RING interface to form an intramolecular salt-bridge , which destabilizes the native complex . The new intramolecular salt-bridge also inhibits the long-range transient interactions formed by R14 with TRAF6RING . In addition , repulsive interactions between E100 and the negatively charged interface of TRAF6RING destabilize the transient complexes . Cumulatively , these mechanisms reduced the binding energy between UBC13 and TRAF6RING by 1 . 69 kcal/mol . Consequently , its efficiency in activating the UBC13\u00a0~Ub conjugate drops by 6-fold ( Figure 10F ) . The effect of deamidation is also manifested in another UBC13/RING complex . Deamidation reduced the rate of Ub-discharge and the rate of Ub2 synthesis by several folds in the UBC13/RNF38RING complex ( Figure 10F and N ) . These results provide first insights into the molecular mechanism behind the inactivation of the Ubiquitin pathway by bacterial deamidation . For several E3s like RNF38 , the RING domain can function as a monomer ( Buetow et al . , 2015 ) . For others like TRAF6 , the RING domains function as dimers ( Middleton et al . , 2017; Yin et al . , 2009 ) . Since deamidation perturbed the binding of UBC13 to both TRAF6 and RNF38 , it is likely that deamidation inactivates UBC13 for both homo/hetero-dimeric RING-E3s . In dimeric RINGs like TRAF6 , the proximal RING interacts with one unit of UBC13\u00a0~\u00a0Ub , and the distal RING interacts with the donor Ub of another UBC13\u00a0~\u00a0Ub . Additionally , for TRAF6 dimer , the first zinc-finger following the RING domain of one protomer also interacts with the donor Ub of the UBC13\u00a0~\u00a0Ub bound to another protomer ( Middleton et al . , 2017;\u00a0Figure 10\u2014figure supplement 3 ) . However , the binding between UBC13 and TRAF6RING is independent of dimerization ( Yin et al . , 2009 ) , indicating that binding between UBC13 and proximal RING is primary . Indeed , deamidation inhibited the binding of UBC13 to both TRAF6RING and to the longer dimeric TRAF6RZ3 , confirming that secondary interactions between Ub/RING or Ub/zinc-finger cannot compensate for the loss of primary E2/RING interaction . Though the interface of a protein complex has numerous interacting residues , a few hotspot residues contribute significantly to the binding energy than the rest ( Moreira et al . , 2007 ) . Hotspot prediction algorithms reported R14 to be a hotspot at the UBC13/TRAF6RING interface ( Meireles et al . , 2010; Zhu and Mitchell , 2011 ) . Analysis of all the UBC13/RING ( or U-box ) structures shows that intermolecular salt-bridges involving R14 are present in several of the UBC13/RING complexes ( Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . Binding studies by isothermal titration calorimetry measured that R14A substitution reduced the binding energy of UBC13/ZNRF1RING complex by\u00a0~1 . 2 kcal mol\u22121 ( Behera et al . , 2018 ) . Similarly , our NMR titrations measured that R14A substitution reduced the binding energy by\u00a0~1 . 4 kcal mol\u22121 in the UBC13/TRAF6RING complex . Altogether , R14 appears to be a hotspot at the UBC13/TRAF6RING interface . Deamidation of UBC13 disrupts the salt-bridge between R14 and E69 due to competition from E100 , which destabilizes the UBC13/TRAF6RING complex . Recently , the salt-bridge competition or \u2018theft\u2019 mechanism was observed in the binding switch of Raf Kinase Inhibitory Protein ( RKIP ) to either Raf-1 or GPCR-kinase 2 ( Skinner et al . , 2017 ) . Phosphorylation of S153 in RKIP created a new salt-bridge between pS153 and K157 , which disrupted the pre-existing salt-bridges involving K157 and resulted in the local unfolding of RKIP . The unfolding inhibited binding of RKIP to Raf-1 but promoted its binding to GPCR-kinase 2 . Unlike RKIP , deamidation does not alter the local fold of UBC13 . While intramolecular salt-bridges compete within RKIP , the competition is between an intermolecular and intramolecular salt-bridge in UBC13 . Besides the hotspots , electrostatic substitutions at the vicinity of the interface can considerably increase protein-protein association and affinity ( Selzer et al . , 2000 ) . Such substitutions would shift the equilibrium between native and transient complexes ( Volkov et al . , 2010 ) . The proper conformation of transient complexes is vital for two proteins to form a stable , productive complex ( Pan et al . , 2019; Schilder and Ubbink , 2013 ) . How PTMs affect native protein-protein interactions observed in the ground state structure of the complex is well appreciated . However , little is known about how PTMs can affect higher energy transient complexes . PTMs like phosphorylation , eliminylation , and deamidation can change the surface electrostatics of a protein ( Ribet and Cossart , 2010 ) to modulate the conformation and population of transient complexes significantly . By a combination of all-atom simulations and experimental data , this study provides molecular details of how PTMs can modulate transient protein-protein association to inhibit interaction . In the dUBC13/RNF38 complex , deamidation majorly alters transient association . Nonetheless , this causes a 10-fold drop in the catalytic activity of the complex ( Figure 10N ) , indicating that modifying the transient protein-protein association can severely affect function . The fate of the polyubiquitinated substrate depends on the linkage specificity of the conjugated polyubiquitin chain , which in turn depends on the specificity of the E2/E3 interaction . Rationally designed E2/E3 interactions can change the fate and function of cellular proteins ( van Wijk et al . , 2009 ) . Hence , the interfacial contacts that determine E2/E3 specificities are a subject of intense research ( Christensen et al . , 2007; Soss et al . , 2011; van Wijk et al . , 2009; van Wijk et al . , 2012 ) . The strength and functionality of E2/E3 interactions have been typically tested by mutating the interfacial residues ( Christensen et al . , 2007; Das et al . , 2009; Das et al . , 2013 ) . This work provides evidence that transient interactions have an equally significant role in E2/E3 interaction and function . Rational design strategies will improve significantly by incorporating transient E2/E3 interactions . In several cases , the native interactions cannot explain the functional implications of PTMs . This study introduces a new approach to understand the functional role of PTMs by considering their transient interactions . For example , spontaneous deamidation ( non-enzymatic ) is rampant in age-onset diseases , including neurodegenerative and ocular diseases . Deamidation of amylin accelerates its aggregation and amyloid formation ( Dunkelberger et al . , 2012 ) . Crystallins deamidate with age , which promotes its aggregation to trigger cataract ( Pande et al . , 2015 ) . Crystallin surfaces are highly charged , and possibly deamidation alters their charge distribution to promote non-native association leading to aggregation . However , the sites of deamidation on crystallins do not provide a clear mechanism of the process . Deamidation-induced modulation of transient protein-protein association may explain the tendency of these proteins to aggregate . The bacterial effector OspI from S . flexneri presents a fascinating case , wherein a pathogen employs subtle mechanisms like salt-bridge competition and modification of transient protein-protein association , to produce a remarkable cumulative effect of inhibiting protein-protein interaction , polyubiquitination , and the host immune response . Such a mechanism could be a ubiquitous mode of regulating cellular pathways by PTMs . \n The interfacial contacts of UBC13/TRAF6RING were obtained from PDB entry 3HCU using the typical cut-offs in the contact analysis tool in UCSF Chimera ( Pettersen et al . , 2004 ) . Initial structures of UBC13 and TRAF6RING for MD simulations and association rate constant ( kon ) estimation were obtained from the PDB entry 3HCU ( Chain A/B ) , which represents a model of the native complex . For MD simulations of TRAF6RING , a C-terminal truncated model comprising of residues 50\u2013148 was used . Substitutions were introduced by replacing existing sidechain with the best aligning rotamer from the Dunbrack rotamer library ( Dunbrack , 2002 ) in UCSF Chimera ( Pettersen et al . , 2004 ) . Electrostatic surface potentials of UBC13 and TRAF6RING were calculated using the Adaptive Poisson-Boltzmann Solver ( Baker et al . , 2001 ) . All simulation methodologies employed in the study were performed using the AMBER99SB-ILDN force field ( Best and Hummer , 2009; Hornak et al . , 2006; Lindorff-Larsen et al . , 2010 ) . Unbiased MD simulations were performed in GROMACS version 4 . 6 . 4 , while biased simulations were performed using the pull code in Gromacs 5 . 1 . 2 ( Abraham et al . , 2015; Hess et al . , 2008 ) . All the acidic and basic residues apart from Histidines were modeled in their charged states . The Zinc AMBER force field ( Peters et al . , 2010 ) parameters were used to model the two zinc coordination sites within the TRAF6RING domain . The initial structures were solvated in an appropriate box using the TIP3P ( Jorgensen et al . , 1983 ) water model . The non-bonded ion parameters proposed by Joung and Cheatham ( 2008 ) were used to model Na+ and Cl- ions in TIP3P water . Additional non-bonded parameter corrections proposed by Yoo and Aksementiev for cation-chloride ( Yoo and Aksimentiev , 2012 ) , amine-carboxylate ( Yoo and Aksimentiev , 2016b ) and aliphatic carbon-carbon ( Yoo and Aksimentiev , 2016a ) interactions were used for all simulations to eliminate overestimation of the strength of these interactions . A suitable number of counterions were added to neutralize the residual charge of the system , and additional ions were added to the box depending on the desired concentration . The electrically neutral , solvated system was then subjected to energy minimization using the steepest descent method for a maximum of 5000 steps until the maximum force on any atom was less than 1000 kJ mol\u22121 nm\u22121 . Production simulations were performed under periodic boundary conditions at a temperature of 300 K , and 1 bar pressure ( NPT ensemble ) following equilibration carried out for 600 ps with a\u00a0two fs time step . Temperature control was achieved using the v-rescaling thermostat ( Bussi et al . , 2007 ) for both equilibration ( Tc\u00a0=\u00a00 . 1 ps ) and production ( Tc\u00a0=\u00a02 . 5 ps ) steps . The Berendsen ( Berendsen et al . , 1984 ) ( Tp\u00a0=\u00a01 ps ) and Parrinello-Rahman ( Parrinello and Rahman , 1981 ) barostat ( Tp\u00a0=\u00a05 ps ) were employed for pressure control during equilibration and production steps respectively . All bond lengths were constrained using the LINCS ( Hess , 2008 ) algorithm . Virtual interaction sites were employed for hydrogen atoms ( Bjelkmar et al . , 2010 ) , which permitted the use of a five fs time step . Short-range electrostatics and van der Waals interactions were calculated using a 1 . 0 nm cut-off . Long-range electrostatics were calculated using the smooth Particle Mesh Ewald ( PME ) method ( Darden et al . , 1993; Essmann et al . , 1995 ) . An analytical dispersion correction was applied to approximate the effect of long-range van der Waals interactions . Simulations of free dUBC13 and UBC13/dUBC13 native complexes with TRAF6RING were performed using the\u00a0general MD protocol described above . Salt-bridge occupancies were computed using a cut-off distance of 0 . 5 nm between arginine C\u03b6 and glutamate C\u03b4 atoms using a python script . For unbiased-association simulations , UBC13/dUBC13 and TRAF6RING were separated along with the x component of the vector connecting their center of masses by 4 nm in a cubic box with an edge length of 12 . 6 nm . This results in a box volume equal to\u00a0~2000 nm3 and the resulting concentration of each protein species equal to\u00a0~1 mM . Fifteen independent association runs ( 100 ns each with different initial atomic velocities ) were performed at 10 mM NaCl and 100 mM NaCl concentrations . Trajectories were analyzed every 250 ps using analysis scripts available within the Gromacs package . Minimum distances were measured between UBC13 and TRAF6RING to identify native-like , non-native , and non-associating trajectories using g_mindist . Native-like transient complex formation was considered to occur in a trajectory when the minimum distance between the sidechain nitrogen atoms of R6/K10/R14 ( UBC13 ) and sidechain oxygen atoms of D57/E69 ( TRAF6 RING ) fell below 0 . 35 nm and persisted for more than eight ns . Among the remaining trajectories , minimum distances were measured between all UBC13 and TRAF6 RING heavy atoms . Non-native and non-associating trajectories were then identified using the same distance and persistence period cut-off . The spatial distribution of TRAF6RING COMs around UBC13/dUBC13 was obtained by calculating the displacement between COMs of C\u03b1 atoms of helix-I in UBC13 and TRAF6RING ( 70-109 ) using g_dist and plotted for all fifteen association trajectories . RMSD-based structural clustering ( Daura et al . , 1999 ) with a cut-off of 0 . 45 nm was performed on pairwise rmsd matrices ( determined using g_rmsd ) of the combined trajectories ( 1 . 5 \u03bcs ) using UBC13/dUBC13 ( C\u03b1 atoms ) as a reference for superposition to obtain the UBC13/TRAF6RING transient complex clusters . The rmsd was computed for the backbone atoms of both UBC13 and TRAF6RING between all trajectory snapshots . The output structures of the complex were then superposed on UBC13 ( PDB: 3HCU ) to obtain the location of TRAF6RING cluster representatives . Native complex formation was identified by measuring the C\u03b1 rmsd of TRAF6RING with respect to its position in the crystal complex for trajectories which exhibited the formation of native-like transient complexes using UBC13 ( C\u03b1 atoms ) as a reference for superposition . Two-dimensional free energy landscapes for UBC13/dUBC13 association with TRAF6RING were computed as a function of minimum distance ( for salt-bridges between UBC13-R6/K10/R14 and TRAF6-D57/E69 ) and TRAF6RING rmsd using a python script . Bin width of 0 . 02 nm was used for both coordinates , and the free energy ( \u0394G ) corresponding to each bin were determined using the relation: ( 2 ) \u0394G ( R1 , R2 ) =\u2212KBT[InPi\u2212InPmax]where R1/R2 are the two reaction coordinates , kB is the Boltzmann constant , T is the temperature , Pi is the joint probability of R1/R2 in a given bin and Pmax is the max value of the probability . The lowest free energy state corresponds to \u0394G\u00a0=\u00a00 . Visualization of MD trajectories and analysis of the native contacts was performed using the MD analysis tool in UCSF Chimera . Umbrella\u00a0sampling is an enhanced-sampling method ( Torrie and Valleau , 1977 ) to determine free energy differences for state transformations by calculating the potential of mean force ( PMF ) as the function of a predefined reaction coordinate ( \u03be ) . This amounts to performing multiple , equilibrium MD simulations along with a range of \u03be values and determining the corresponding free energy ( A ( \u03be ) ) . At points along \u03be which are referred to as windows , a harmonic restraining potential ( wi ) is added to the original Hamiltonian in order to restrain the system close to a target value ( \u03bei ) : ( 3 ) Eb ( r ) =Eu ( r ) +wi ( \u03be ) ( 4 ) wi ( \u03be ) =k/2\u2217 ( \u03be\u2212\u03bei ) 2 In Equation ( 2 ) , E ( r ) denotes the potential energy function ( force field ) of the system as a function of atomic coordinates ( r ) . Subscripts b and u indicate biased and unbiased energies . k is the force constant for the harmonic bias potential whose magnitude determines the range of \u03be values sampled within each window . The application of the bias potential particularly improves sampling in high energy regions along \u03be which are poorly sampled in conventional MD simulations . The modified energy function yields biased probability distributions ( Pib ( \u03be ) ) of \u03be from which the unbiased , free energy ( Ai ( \u03be ) ) of a window can be computed using the relation: ( 5 ) Ai ( \u03be ) =\u2212kBTlnPib ( \u03be ) \u2212wi ( \u03be ) +Fi The value of Fi needs to be determined for all windows to combine adjacent windows and obtain the global free energy profile ( A ( \u03be ) ) , which describes state transformation . The weighted histogram analysis method ( WHAM ) ( Kumar et al . , 1992 ) is widely used to determine optimal values of Fi in an iterative fashion so as to obtain convergence of the free energy profile . Similar to previous studies which utilized the US approach to study the energetics of protein-protein association , the center of mass ( COM ) separation along the x-axis was chosen as the reaction coordinate to calculate the PMF for Barnase/Barstar and UBC13/TRAF6 RING association . Barstar and UBC13 were translated along the x-axis of the vector joining the COM between their binding partners to positions separated by 0 . 1 nm intervals to achieve final separations of 4 . 0 and 4 . 5 nm respectively . Each window was simulated in a rectangular box of dimensions 12 . 6 nm x 9 . 0 nm x 9 . 0 mm following equilibration . During production MD ( 10 ns for each window ) , a harmonic restraining potential ( k\u00a0=\u00a01500 kJ mol\u22121 nm\u22122 ) was applied to the COM vector in each window and data were collected every 250 fs . The biased COM probability distributions from each window were analyzed based on WHAM and combined to obtain the global free energy ( PMF ) profile using the g_wham analysis tool ( Hub et al . , 2010 ) . A total of 200 bins were used to construct a mean PMF profile from five independent time blocks ( 1 . 5 ns each from 2 . 5 to 10 ns ) for each window ( Supplementary file 1-table\u00a0S2 ) . A tolerance of 10\u22129 was used to check for convergence . The free energy of association ( \u0394GPMF ) along the COM coordinate was determined by setting the free energy profile to zero in the unbound state ( 4 . 0 nm for Barnase/Barstar and 4 . 5 nm for UBC13/TRAF6RING ) and determining the value of the profile at mean COM separation in the native complex ( 2 . 3 nm for Barnase/Barstar and 2 . 7 nm for UBC13/TRAF6RING ) window during production MD . Coulombic interaction energies from the US windows were calculated using g_energy tool in Gromacs . Steered\u00a0MD is a non-equilibrium , enhanced-sampling technique wherein a time-dependent biasing potential is applied on a selected atom/COM of atomic groups to induce perturbation in the system ( Grubm\u00fcller et al . , 1996 ) . This is achieved by means of a moving dummy atom attached to the pull group via a stiff harmonic spring . This method has been previously employed to study the unfolding of protein domains and the dissociation of protein-ligand complexes . In this study , we carried out force-induced unbinding of TRAF6RING from UBC13 using the constant velocity pulling method along the x-axis to a COM separation of\u00a0~\u00a06 nm in 30 ns long simulations . The external force ( Fext ) acting on the pull group as the simulation progresses with time ( t ) is defined by the relation: ( 6 ) Fext=k ( vt\u2212x ) where k is the spring constant , v is the pull velocity , and x is the displacement of the ligand from its initial position . The pull force was applied to COM of C\u03b1 atoms of the RING domain ( residues 70\u2013109 ) at a low pull rate of 0 . 125 nm ns\u22121 ( k\u00a0=\u00a01500 kJ mol\u22121 nm\u22122 ) . The same box dimensions were used as in the case of umbrella sampling . The COM of C\u03b1 atoms of UBC13 was kept fixed by periodically removing its rotational and translation motion to promote dissociation of the complex . The cumulative work ( W ) done to separate complex was calculated using the relation: ( 7 ) W=\u222bF . dx=1/2\u2211 ( fi+fi ) ( Xi+1\u2212Xi ) The work done over two successive simulation steps ( i and i+1 ) is calculated as a product of the average force ( f ) multiplied by the displacement of the ligand between the steps . W is thus calculated by numerically integrating the work done between all successive steps of the simulation . The force and COM position of TRAF6RING was recorded every five ps . Fmax ( rupture force ) is defined as the maximum value of the force recorded in the Force-COM extension profile of an individual or averaged SMD trajectory . W was defined at a COM separation of 4 . 5 nm in the Work-COM extension profile as all native contacts were found to be disrupted at this COM separation . Both Fmax and W correlate with the binding affinity of the complex and hence allow for an analysis of the effect of mutations on the stability of the complex . The association rate constants ( kon ) for UBC13/dUBC13/R14A-UBC13 with TRAF6RING were calculated based on transient complex theory ( Alsallaq and Zhou , 2008 ) . The crystallographic complexes were provided as inputs to the TransComp webserver ( Qin et al . , 2011 ) . The server computes the association rate constant ( kon ) from a basal association rate constant ( ka0 ) in the absence of electrostatic interactions and the electrostatic free energy ( \u0394Gel ) of a pre-generated transient complex ensemble using the relation: ( 8 ) kon=kaoexp ( \u2212\u0394Gel/kT ) where k and T are the Boltzmann constant and temperature , respectively . The kon values for all complexes were computed at ionic strengths of 10 and 100 mM NaCl . To generate the transient complex ensemble from the crystallographic complex , proteins are treated as rigid bodies and configurations are randomly sampled along six relevant degrees of freedom . Three degrees of freedom are for relative rotation and three for relative translation . Sampling is performed such that the distance between the center of the binding sites of the interacting proteins remains within a suitable cutoff ( rcut ) . The desired value of rcut is determined in an iterative fashion by varying from 0 . 6 to 1 . 0 nm ( increment of 0 . 1 nm ) so as to generate 107 clash-free configurations . The number of intermolecular contacts ( both native and non-native ) is calculated for all configurations . The standard deviation in the rotation angle ( \u03c3\u03c7 ) is calculated for configurations at each contact level ( Nc ) . The transient complex ensemble corresponds to the value of Nc at which the difference between \u03c3\u03c7 ( Nc ) and the average of all lower contact levels reaches a maximum . From the transient complex ensemble , the electrostatic interaction energy ( Uel ) was calculated for each configuration as ( 9 ) Uel=Uel ( AB ) \u2212Uel ( A ) \u2212Uel ( B ) where Uel ( AB ) corresponds to the interaction energy of the complex and Uel ( A/B ) corresponds to that of the two unbound proteins . Electrostatic energies are calculated using the linearized Poisson-Boltzmann equation . \u0394Gel is calculated as a simple average over interaction energies of the transient complex ensemble . ka0 is determined from 4000 force-free Brownian dynamics trajectories based on a previously developed algorithm ( Zhou , 1993 ) . All videos were prepared by pre-processing trajectories using a lowpass filter ( g_filter tool in Gromacs ) followed by the recording of trajectory snapshots in UCSF Chimera using the MD analysis module . In all trajectories , rotational and translational motion of UBC13 was removed entirely to fix its position with respect to TRAF6RING . A synthetic construct for TRAF6RING ( residues 50\u2013124 ) was synthesized at Thermo Fischer Scientific , USA . PCR amplified ORF was cloned into a pGEX4T1 vector using NEB HF cloning kit ( New England Biolabs , Inc USA ) . E69A-TRAF6 was cloned using PCR based site-directed mutagenesis .

The supernatant was bound to HisTrap beads and was with 150 mM-450mM Imidazole gradient . The eluent was subsequently purified by gel filtration on Superdex 75 pg 16/600 ( GE Healthcare ) in 25 mM Tris , 100 mM NaCl and 5 mM \u03b2ME at pH 7 . 5 . For the purification of Ub and its variants , lysed cells were resuspended in lysis buffer ( 50 mM Sodium acetate , 5 mM BME , 0 . 01% Triton X , pH 4 . 5 ) , lysed by sonication and centrifuged to pellet cell debris . The supernatant was passed through the SP FF column ( GE Healthcare ) and the protein was eluted by gradient elution with increasing salt concentration ( 0 mM NaCl- 600 mM NaCl ) . The proteins were further purified by gel filtration chromatography on Superdex 75 16/600 column ( GE Healthcare ) in 50 mM Sodium Phosphate , 100 mM NaCl , 5 mM BME , pH 6 . 5 .

The mixture was dialyzed in 50 mM Sodium Acetate , 5 mM BME , pH 4 . 5 , and centrifuged . The supernatant was passed through the SP FF column ( GE Healthcare ) and the di-Ub was separated by gradient elution with increasing salt concentration ( 0 mM NaCl- 600 mM NaCl ) .

The titration data was fit in 1:1 protein:ligand model using the equation CSPobs\u00a0=\u00a0CSPmax { ( [P]t+[L]t+Kd ) - [ ( [P]t+[L]t+Kd ) 2- 4[P]t[L]t]1/2}/2[P]t , where [P]t and [L]t are total concentrations of protein and ligand at any titration point .

The samples were prepared in 25 mM phosphate , 50 mM NaCl , pH 6 . 0 . D2O was not directly added to the NMR sample to avoid additional signals due to 2H isotopomers . For NMR lock , the 3 mm NMR tube was inserted co-axially in an external tube containing D2O .

{"lay_summary": "The brain processes information through the activity of many different types of neurons . A common assumption is that we can work out the role of each type of neuron by increasing or decreasing its activity experimentally and observing the consequences . Imagine , for example , that increasing the activity of a group of neurons boosts the formation of memories , whereas decreasing their activity has the opposite effect . Can we conclude that the natural role of those neurons is to support memory formation ? This question has become increasingly pertinent in recent years , as advances in molecular genetic techniques such as optogenetics have made it easier to experimentally manipulate the activity of neurons . However , the ease with which these experiments can be done masks how difficult it can be to interpret the results . To test the assumption that dialing a neuron\u2019s activity up or down provides a straightforward readout of its role in the brain , Phillips and Hasenstaub used optogenetics to inactivate two types of neurons in an area of the mouse brain responsible for processing sound . Inactivating each cell type produced different outcomes . The standard way of interpreting these results is to conclude that the neurons must therefore have different , separable roles . However , using optogenetics to increase the activity of the neurons revealed no such differences in the neurons\u2019 roles . Using a computer model , Phillips and Hasenstaub showed that relatively small changes in factors such as the spontaneous activity of the neurons can affect the outcome of the experiments . Under certain circumstances , the two types of neurons respond in the same way to activation and inactivation; under other circumstances , they respond differently . The results presented by Phillips and Hasenstaub remind us that the conclusions we draw about a neuron\u2019s role can be sensitive to how the cell was manipulated . Future studies should address how other aspects of experimental manipulations , such as their timing or pattern , affect the apparent behavior of neurons .", "article": "Bidirectional manipulations \u2013 activation and inactivation \u2013 are widely used to identify the functions supported by specific cortical interneuron types . Implicit in much of this work is the notion that tonic activation and inactivation will both produce valid , internally consistent insights into interneurons\u2019 computational roles . Here , using single-unit recordings in auditory cortex of awake mice , we show that this may not generally hold true . Optogenetically manipulating somatostatin-positive ( Sst+ ) or parvalbumin-positive ( Pvalb+ ) interneurons while recording tone-responses showed that Sst+ inactivation increased response gain , while Pvalb+ inactivation weakened tuning and decreased information transfer , implying that these neurons support delineable computational functions . But activating Sst+ and Pvalb+ interneurons revealed no such differences . We used a simple network model to understand this asymmetry , and showed how relatively small changes in key parameters , such as spontaneous activity or strength of the light manipulation , determined whether activation and inactivation would produce consistent or paradoxical conclusions regarding interneurons\u2019 computational functions . \n Throughout the neocortex , inhibition shapes the gain and tuning of sensory responses ( Kyriazi et al . , 1996; Tsumoto and Sato , 1985; Wang et al . , 2000 ) , controls the precise timing of evoked action potentials ( Akiyama et al . , 2004; Gabernet et al . , 2005; Hasenstaub et al . , 2005; Poo and Isaacson , 2009; Wehr and Zador , 2003 ) , and can coordinate rhythmic activity , which gates sensory responses and modulates information processing ( Cardin et al . , 2009; Deans et al . , 2001; Hasenstaub et al . , 2005; Sohal et al . , 2009 ) . Although they comprise a minority of cells in the cortex , the GABAergic interneurons that provide this inhibition are strikingly diverse ( rev . [Petilla Interneuron Nomenclature et al . , 2008] ) : unique combinations of gene expression , electrophysiological properties , morphology , and connectivity define multiple interneuron types , and likely allow each interneuron type to exert a unique mode of control over cortical function . A longstanding goal in sensory neuroscience has been to establish how , if at all , interneuron types differ in their contributions to normal cortical function . However , isolating each subtype to causally determine its contributions to cortical processing has been hindered by the limited repertoire of techniques available . Recent advances in molecular techniques , such as optogenetics ( Boyden et al . , 2005; Zhang et al . , 2011 ) , chemogenetics ( Armbruster et al . , 2007 ) , and more recently magnetogenetics ( Wheeler et al . , 2016 ) , have transcended traditional methods of probing cell function , enabling reversible and selective activation or inactivation of interneuron firing in vivo . These tools have been used extensively to identify the particular functions each interneuron subtype serves within the cortex ( Adesnik et al . , 2012; Aizenberg et al . , 2015; Atallah et al . , 2012; Cardin et al . , 2009; Cottam et al . , 2013; Lee et al . , 2012; Natan et al . , 2015; Seybold et al . , 2015; Sohal et al . , 2009; Wilson et al . , 2012; Xu et al . , 2013 ) . An implicit assumption underlying much of this work is that one can directly read out a cell type\u2019s function , and infer its specialized operations , by tonically modulating its firing down or up: in other words , that the response features or computations weakened by inactivating a cell population are specifically those that the cell population normally supports , that these features will be strengthened when the same population is activated , and that the natural differences in cortical function between cell populations may be read out , and interpreted , using these same strategies . Can the abundance of recent causal data be interpreted in such a straightforward way ? Here , in line with the broader goal of establishing the ways in which we can use causal strategies to gain insight into interneuron function , we tested this assumption by manipulating either of the two main families of cortical interneurons \u2013 somatostatin-positive ( Sst+ ) or parvalbumin-positive ( Pvalb+ ) interneurons \u2013 while recording neural responses to tones in the auditory cortex of awake mice . We found that inactivation of Sst+ interneurons increased response gain , while inactivation of Pvalb+ interneurons weakened tuning and decreased information transfer , implying that these two neuron types support specific , separable functions in the auditory cortex . Yet activating Sst+ and Pvalb+ interneurons revealed no such differences . We used a simple feedforward model to understand this asymmetry , and found that relatively small changes in key parameters , such as baseline activity , neural thresholds , or the strength of the light manipulation , determined whether activation and inactivation would produce internally consistent conclusions regarding interneurons\u2019 computational functions . This implies that seemingly minor experimental details can qualitatively change the readout of a neural population\u2019s role in computation , and that the conclusions we draw regarding neuronal function can be influenced , even distorted , by the precise way in which the neuronal populations are manipulated . \n To produce mice in which we could inactivate Sst+ or Pvalb+ interneurons , we crossed mouse strains that express Cre-recombinase under control of the Sst or Pvalb promoter ( Taniguchi et al . , 2011 ) with the Ai35 strain , in which expression of Arch-GFP is Cre-dependent ( Madisen et al . , 2012 ) ( referred to as Arch/Sst and Arch/Pvalb mice , respectively ) . In Arch/Sst mice , the percentage of GFP labeled neurons that showed Sst fluorescence ( i . e . , specificity ) was 89 \u00b1 4% , and the percentage of Sst labeled neurons that were GFP-labeled ( i . e . , efficiency ) was 91 \u00b1 2% , and in Arch/Pvalb mice the specificity was 93 \u00b1 2% and the efficiency was 89 \u00b1 7% , consistent with previous reports ( Adesnik et al . , 2012; Cardin et al . , 2009; Kerlin et al . , 2010; Kvitsiani et al . , 2013; Pfeffer et al . , 2013; Sohal et al . , 2009; Taniguchi et al . , 2011 ) ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . We placed these transgenic mice on a spherical treadmill and used a 16-channel linear probe to record from single units in auditory cortex while the animals were awake , head-fixed , and passively listening to pure-tone acoustic stimuli . On randomly interleaved trials the tone was paired with green ( 532 nm ) light , delivered through a fiber optic placed just above the surface of the cortex , to reduce interneuron activity during the pre-stimulus and response periods ( Figure 1a , b , e , f ) . For each recorded unit we generated iso-intensity frequency tuning curves ( FTCs ) in both the light-off and light-on conditions by measuring the firing rates ( FRs ) in the 50 ms period after tone-response onset as a function of frequency ( Figure 1c , g ) . In these mice , illumination of the cortical surface with green light had a range of effects on sound-evoked FRs , spontaneous FRs , and the signal-to-noise ratio ( SNR: defined 6as the ratio between sound-evoked FR and spontaneous FR ) ( Figure 1b , f; Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . Of the units with frequency-tuned responses ( see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods; Arch/Sst: n = 70 of 96 units; Arch/Pvalb: n = 59 of 76 units ) , the majority had sound-evoked FRs that were significantly increased by light ( Arch/Sst: n = 44 of 70 units; Arch/Pvalb: n = 41 of 59 units ) ; a minority had responses that were significantly suppressed by light ( Arch/Sst: n = 11 of 70 units; Arch/Pvalb: n = 5 of 59 units ) ; and the remainder had responses with no significant change ( Arch/Sst: n = 15 of 70 units; Arch/Pvalb: n = 13 of 59 units ) ( Figure 1d , h ) . A small fraction of units with no significant change to their tone responses nonetheless showed significant changes to their baseline activity ( Arch/Sst: n = 6 of 15; Arch/Pvalb: n = 4 of 13 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 18383 . 003Figure 1 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 18383 . 005 To characterize how optogenetically altering inhibition affects a neuron\u2019s tuning curve , we employed a common framework that models the effect as a linear transformation , comprised of scaling ( multiplicative/divisive ) and shifting ( additive/subtractive ) components . We calculated these components by fitting a straight line to the average firing rates on trials with ( green ) versus without ( black ) altered inhibition ( Figure 2a ) . In the context of optogenetically manipulating interneurons in the auditory cortex , comparing a neuron\u2019s FTC in the light-on versus light-off conditions would be expected to reveal whether the change in firing in that neuron is well fit by such a model , and , if so , whether and to what extent the transformation is multiplicative/divisive ( Figure 2b ) , additive/subtractive ( Figure 2c ) , or a combination ( Figure 2d ) . The slope of the best-fit line , if significantly different from unity , reveals the magnitude of the multiplicative/divisive component of the transformation ( Figure 2b ) , while the y-intercept of the best-fit line , if significantly different from zero , reveals the magnitude and significance of the additive/subtractive component ( Figure 2c ) . Within this framework , a neuron\u2019s FTC may undergo eight possible types of linear transformations ( e . g . significantly divisive but not significantly additive/subtractive , significantly divisive and significantly subtractive , significantly subtractive but not significantly multiplicative/divisive , and so on; Figure 2d ) ; alternatively , neither the scaling nor shifting components may be significant at all . 10 . 7554/eLife . 18383 . 006Figure 2 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 18383 . 006 What does inactivating Sst+ and Pvalb+ cells lead us to conclude about their specific contributions to the gain ( multiplication/division ) or tuning ( addition/subtraction ) of tone responses ? We applied the linear regression described above to the 44 units recorded from Arch/Sst and 41 units from Arch/Pvalb mice whose responses were tuned for frequency and significantly increased by light ( see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods ) . This included both narrow-spiking and broad-spiking units ( defined by a trough-to-peak duration of less than or greater than 450 \u03bcs , respectively; see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods ) . Most units showed predominantly linear changes in their FTC with decreased inhibition ( Arch/Sst: median R2 = 0 . 81; Arch/Pvalb: median R2 = 0 . 78; Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . Inactivation of Sst+ cells produced a variety of linear transformations ( Figure 3a , pink examples ) , as did inactivation of Pvalb+ cells ( Figure 3a , light blue examples ) . However , the proportions of linear transformation types produced by inactivation of Sst+ cells were significantly different from those produced by inactivation of Pvalb+ cells ( Fisher\u2019s exact test p=0 . 0015; Figure 3b ) . To quantitatively compare the effects of inactivating Sst+ or Pvalb+ cells on response gain ( i . e . , the magnitude of the multiplicative component ) , we compared the distributions of the slope values obtained from the linear regression analyses ( Figure 3c ) and found that inactivating Sst+ cells had a significantly larger effect on the response gain than inactivating Pvalb+ cells ( rank-sum p=0 . 01 ) . Furthermore , inactivating Pvalb+ cells had a significantly larger effect on the magnitude of the additive component compared to inactivating Sst+ cells ( rank-sum p=1 . 5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22124; Figure 3d ) . These differences between the effects of inactivating Sst+ versus Pvalb+ cells were more prominent among broad-spiking units than narrow-spiking units ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . Interestingly , this larger additive effect produced by inactivating Pvalb+ cells was not entirely due to increases in spontaneous activity , as performing linear regression on baseline-subtracted responses ( defined as sound-evoked FR minus spontaneous FR; Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3a , b ) revealed similar differences in both the slopes and y-intercepts ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3c , d ) , implying that the additive effect produced by inactivation of Pvalb+ cells must include a substantial contribution from sound-evoked responses that are not frequency selective . 10 . 7554/eLife . 18383 . 007Figure 3 .

However , among the units with broad-spiking waveforms ( >450 \u03bcs ) whose activity was increased by light ( Arch/Sst: n = 29; Arch/Pvalb: n = 26 ) , Sst+ cell inactivation produced significantly larger slopes ( rank-sum p=0 . 046 ) than Pvalb+ cell inactivation .

Inactivation of Sst+ cells , compared to inactivation of Pvalb+ cells , produces different proportions of linear effects , even after matching unit populations based on firing rate ratios . ( a ) The linear regression analysis is limited to units from Arch/Sst mice and Arch/Pvalb mice that have similar sound-evoked firing rate ratios ( Arch/Sst: n = 37 units from 12 mice; Arch/Pvalb: n = 37 units from 11 mice ) . ( b ) Distribution of the R2 values from the linear regression analysis from ratio-matched units with inactivation of Sst+ cells ( pink ) and inactivation of Pvalb+ cells ( light blue ) . High median R2 values demonstrate that most ratio-matched units are fit well by a linear framework ( Arch/Sst: median R2 = 0 . 78; Arch/Pvalb: median R2 = 0 . 87 ) ( c ) Fraction of units that showed each kind of linear transformation with inactivation of Sst+ cells ( pink ) or inactivation of Pvalb+ cells ( light blue ) were significantly different from each other ( Arch/Sst: n = 37 units; Arch/Pvalb: n = 37 units; Fisher\u2019s exact test p=0 . 0058 ) .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 18383 . 012 Note that , all other factors being equal , both the slope and y-intercept of the linear regression ( i . e . , the degree to which a linear transformation registers as multiplicative or additive ) , and the chances that either of these coefficients will be statistically significant , will be greater in units whose firing rates are more strongly affected by the light ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 4 ) . Although we observed that even weakly affected unit populations showed significant differences in both slopes and intercepts ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 4 ) , we wondered whether these differences might still be explained by an overall greater increase in firing rates when inactivating one interneuron type versus the other . We addressed this potential confound by limiting our population analyses to units with similar increases in firing rates ( see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods; Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 5a ) . In these matched populations , we again found that the proportions of linear transformations produced by inactivating Sst+ or Pvalb+ cells differed ( Fisher\u2019s exact test , p=0 . 0058; Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 5c ) , as did the magnitudes of both the multiplicative and additive effects ( slopes: rank-sum p=0 . 0064; Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 5d; y-intercepts: rank-sum p=0 . 0048; Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 5e ) . To perform the complementary experiment , we produced mice in which we could activate Sst+ or Pvalb+ interneurons by crossing Sst- and Pvalb-Cre mouse strains ( Taniguchi et al . , 2011 ) with the Ai32 strain , in which expression of ChR2-eYFP is Cre-dependent ( Madisen et al . , 2012 ) ( hereafter referred to as ChR2/Sst and ChR2/Pvalb mice , respectively; Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . In ChR2/Sst mice , somatostatin mostly co-localized with GFP , and in ChR2/Pvalb mice , parvalbumin mostly co-localized with GFP ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . In these mice , blue light had a range of effects on both sound-evoked FRs , spontaneous FRs , and SNRs ( Figure 4b , f; Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . Of the frequency-tuned units ( ChR2/Sst: n = 97 of 163 units; ChR2/Pvalb: n = 103 of 160 units; see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods ) , the majority had responses to tones that were significantly reduced by light ( ChR2/Sst: n = 64 of 97 units; ChR2/Pvalb: n = 62 of 103 units ) , a minority had responses that were significantly increased by light ( ChR2/Sst: n = 19 of 97 units; ChR2/Pvalb: n = 21 of 103 units ) , and the remainder of units\u2019 responses showed no significant change ( ChR2/Sst: n = 14 of 97 units; ChR2/Pvalb: n = 20 of 103 units ) . A small fraction of units with no significant change to their tone responses nonetheless showed significant changes to their spontaneous activity ( ChR2/Sst: n = 4 of 14; ChR2/Pvalb: n = 3 of 20 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 18383 . 013Figure 4 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 18383 . 022 Counterintuitively , given the observation that inactivation of Sst+ versus Pvalb+ interneurons caused different effects on the gain and tuning of tone responses , the proportions of significant linear transformations observed when activating Sst+ cells and activating Pvalb+ cells were similar to one another ( Fisher\u2019s exact test p=0 . 51; Figure 5b ) . Furthermore , the distributions of the slope values and the distributions of the y-intercept values obtained from the linear regression analyses were similar ( slopes: rank-sum p=0 . 68; Figure 5c; y-intercepts: rank-sum p=0 . 77; Figure 5d ) , consistent with our previous work ( Seybold et al . , 2015 ) . These similarities were present among broad-spiking units as well as narrow-spiking units ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . Performing linear regression on baseline-subtracted responses ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3a , b ) also revealed no differences ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3c , d ) . Even among the units with the most suppressed sound-evoked FRs , the effects of Sst+ and Pvalb+ activation were not significantly different from one another ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 4 ) , suggesting that these similarities were not due to insufficient activation of interneurons . To account for potential differences in the distributions of FR suppression produced by activation of each interneuron population , we again matched the two unit populations by their FR ratios . The proportions of linear transformations produced by interneuron activation remained similar ( Fisher\u2019s exact test p=0 . 42; Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 5c ) , as did the magnitudes of both the subtractive and divisive effects ( slopes: rank-sum p=0 . 58; Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 5d; y-intercepts: rank-sum p=0 . 70; Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 5e ) . In sum , the results of our inactivation experiments would imply that Sst+ and Pvalb+ cells normally support different computations; yet these activation experiments would lead to the conclusion that these neurons do not support different functions . This may relate to the effects of activation on the interneurons themselves . We identified putative Sst+ ( n = 24 ) and Pvalb+ ( n = 27 ) units by their increased sound-evoked firing rates with light activation ( seeMaterials\u00a0and methods; example putative interneurons: Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 6 ) . These units had median spike trough-to-peak durations of 348 \u00b1 61 \u03bcs and 287 \u00b1 41 \u03bcs , respectively , were generally spontaneously active before the tone ( putative Sst+: FR = 6 . 3 \u00b1 2 . 5\u2009Hz; putative Pvalb+: FR = 8 . 6 \u00b1 4 . 2\u2009Hz ) , and increased their firing during the tone ( putative Sst+: FR = 12 . 2 \u00b1 8 . 5\u2009Hz; putative Pvalb+: FR = 24 . 8 \u00b1 12 . 7\u2009Hz ) . Interestingly , optogenetic activation of putative Sst+ and Pvalb+ interneurons had a larger effect on spontaneous FRs ( putative Sst+: FR ratio = 3 . 9 \u00b1 2 . 9; putative Pvalb+: FR ratio = 2 . 5 \u00b1 0 . 8 ) , than sound-evoked FRs ( putative Sst+: FR ratio = 2 . 9 \u00b1 1 . 5; putative Pvalb+: FR ratio = 1 . 5 \u00b1 0 . 2 ) . Moreover , even putative interneurons that were not generally active without light ( sound-evoked rate of less than 5\u2009Hz; putative Sst+: n = 7 units; putative Pvalb+: n = 1 unit ) often showed FRs well above 30\u2009Hz during the light ( putative Sst+: evoked rate = 35 . 04 \u00b1 28 . 3\u2009Hz; putative Pvalb+: evoked rate = 54 . 5\u2009Hz ) . Together , these results suggest that activation increases the number of stimulus-independent spikes generated by both interneuron populations , potentially masking normal stimulus-driven function . This apparent incongruity between the effects of inactivation and activation of interneurons on the gain and tuning of frequency tuning curves prompted us to ask whether we would observe a similar discrepancy in other aspects of sensory processing . Synaptic inhibition can enhance the transfer of information regarding stimulus identity in multiple ways: for instance , rapidly fluctuating inhibition might improve information transfer by linearizing responses ( Hasenstaub et al . , 2005; Sohal et al . , 2009 ) , slower feedforward inhibition might optimize information transfer by adapting the dynamic range of the neuron to the dynamic range of its inputs ( Tan et al . , 2008 ) , while changes in tonic inhibition might selectively delete irrelevant spikes or change the number of spikes available to represent information ( Duguid et al . , 2012 ) . These inhibitory dynamics and computational features have been differentially linked to Sst+ or Pvalb+ interneurons ( Cardin et al . , 2009; Hasenstaub et al . , 2005; Sohal et al . , 2009; Tan et al . , 2008; Wehr and Zador , 2003 ) . To test whether optogenetically inactivating and activating these interneurons also produced discrepant effects on information transfer through cortical neurons , we calculated the per-trial mutual information ( in bits/trial; see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods ) between the stimulus and firing rate output , in both the light-off and light-on conditions , for each unit analyzed previously ( Figure 6a , f , example units ) . The effects of inactivating Sst+ cells on information-per-trial were significantly different from the effects of inactivating Pvalb+ cells ( rank-sum p=7 . 1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22126; Figure 6b , c ) : inactivating Sst+ cells significantly increased information-per-trial ( sign-rank p=0 . 022 ) , while inactivating Pvalb+ cells significantly decreased it ( sign-rank p=1 . 3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22124 ) . Are these different effects on information transfer produced by inactivation of Sst+ versus Pvalb+ cells simply related to overall changes in the number of spikes available to represent information ? To address this , we calculated firing-rate-normalized mutual information ( i . e . , the information about the stimulus carried by each spike ) . The effects on information-per-spike of inactivating Sst+ cells versus Pvalb+ cells were significantly different ( rank-sum p=1 . 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22125 ) , inconsistent with the notion that the observed differences in information transfer were due to differences in firing rate modulation ( Figure 6d , e ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 18383 . 023Figure 6 . Optogenetically inactivating Sst+ versus Pvalb+ cells produces different effects on mutual information ( MI ) , whereas activating these interneurons produces similar effects on MI .

( i ) As ( g ) but for information-per-spike . ( j ) As ( h ) but for information-per-spike . Activating Sst+ cells ( sign-rank p=3 . 9\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22129 ) and activating Pvalb+ cells ( sign-rank p =1 . 5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22128 ) both significantly increased the information-per-spike , but these effects were not significantly different from each other ( rank-sum p=0 . 20 ) . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 18383 . 023 In contrast , activating Sst+ cells and activating Pvalb+ cells did not differentially impact information-per-trial ( rank-sum p=0 . 85 ) : indeed , neither activation of Sst+ cells nor activation of Pvalb+ cells significantly changed information-per-trial ( ChR2/Sst: sign-rank p=0 . 53; ChR2/Pvalb: sign-rank p=0 . 63; Figure 6g , h ) . This lack of differential impact on information-per-trial was likely not due to insufficient activation of interneurons because even the most strongly suppressed units did not exhibit significant differences ( ChR2/Sst and ChR2/Pvalb: rank-sum p=0 . 50 ) . These results are consistent with our previous work , which found no differences between activation of Sst+ or Pvalb+ interneurons on tuning bandwidths ( Seybold et al . , 2015 ) . Additionally , the incongruity between inactivation and activation ( specifically , that inactivation does reveal significant differences in interneuron regulation of information transfer , whereas activation does not ) was apparent even after matching units based on the amount that they their firing rates were suppressed or enhanced ( Arch/Sst and Arch/Pvalb: rank-sum p=1 . 7\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010-\u22125; ChR2/Sst and ChR2/Pvalb: rank-sum p=0 . 65 ) . The ostensible functional equivalencies between Sst+ and Pvalb+ interneurons we observed with optogenetic activation , yet functional differences produced by their inactivation , is paradoxical: how can these supposedly complementary manipulations produce such inconsistent effects ? We modeled the effects of inactivating and activating interneuron populations in a densely connected network . We reasoned that not only will optogenetic manipulations of interneurons exert first-order effects on a given neuron , through direct inhibition or removal of inhibition , but they will also yield second-order effects , by altering the network-wide activity of the neuron\u2019s inputs . Consider an example in which one downstream neuron receives inputs from several upstream ( 'input-layer' ) neurons ( Figure 7a , h ) . Each input neuron shows evoked responses that are tuned to particular frequencies , superimposed on a modest baseline level of activity , as is often the case in awake states ( rev . [Haider and McCormick , 2009] ) . Neurons with more similar tuning to that of the downstream neuron are more strongly connected to it . The net drive to the downstream neuron is the sum of these weighted inputs . How will multiplicative , additive , divisive , or subtractive modulation propagate through this simple layered network ? 10 . 7554/eLife . 18383 . 024Figure 7 . Inactivation versus activation of interneurons can have asymmetrical effects on response gain in a simple network model . ( a ) A population of neurons tuned to different frequencies ( light colored cells ) provides input to a downstream neuron ( large black neuron ) in a weighted fashion , such that neurons with more similar tuning to that of the downstream neuron are more strongly connected to it ( indicated by color and axon thickness ) . Interneurons that inhibit these input neurons ( green cells ) are inactivated , which increases the activity of the input neurons . Number of input neurons: 101; maximum connection weight: 0 . 2; connection weight falloff: Gaussian with 2SD; input neuron threshold: 0 .

( l\u2013n ) As ( b\u2013d ) , but demonstrating the effects of subtraction in the FTC of a single input ( l ) , many weighted inputs ( m ) , and the net input to the downstream neuron ( n ) . Note that the change in net input in the downstream neuron caused by subtraction of inputs appears similar to the change caused by division of inputs . This is due to responses of single input neurons that are suppressed below threshold with subtractive inhibition , causing smaller changes in firing at the edges of the tuning curve than at the center . Shifting factor: -0 . 15 .

Thus multiplication of the input neurons\u2019 responses produces the strongest increase in firing near the center of the downstream neuron\u2019s tuning curve , where stimuli evoke the strongest responses ( Figure 7d ) . Similarly , additively modulating a single input ( Figure 7e ) produces a constant increase in the firing rate of each weighted input ( Figure 7f ) , which , summed in the downstream neuron , leads to a constant ( additive ) increase in its net drive across all stimulus frequencies ( Figure 7g ) . Thus , inactivation of interneurons preserves the single-cell effects of multiplication and addition at the network level in this simple model . This contrasts with the effect of interneuron activation . As we have previously demonstrated ( Seybold et al . , 2015 ) divisive suppression acts purely linearly on the weighted inputs ( Figure 7i , j ) ; from the perspective of a downstream neuron , the largest suppressive effect occurs near the center of its tuning curve . In contrast , subtractive suppression does not linearly suppress the firing of the input neurons because the weakest responses are suppressed below the nonlinear spiking threshold , creating a 'floor effect' at the edges of the tuning curve . In the downstream neuron , these nonlinear floor effects at the edges sum to produce the strongest suppression at the center of the tuning curve ( Figure 7n ) , and thus , downstream , appear division-like ( Figure 7k , n ) . Importantly , aspects of the network state such as its baseline firing rate determine the regime wherein such asymmetric effects between activation and inactivation will be observed ( Figure 8 ) . For example , in a network with high spontaneous activity ( Figure 8j ) , interneurons must be activated more strongly in order to suppress their targets\u2019 firing rates below the spiking threshold; thus the range of interneuron manipulation levels over which the neural circuit behaves linearly is relatively large ( Figure 8l ) . On the other hand , in a network with low spontaneous activity , in which the edges of the tuning curves already lie below threshold ( Figure 8p ) , even small additive increases in firing rates are impacted by threshold nonlinearities; thus the linear operating range of the network becomes relatively small ( Figure 8r ) . These results highlight that the qualitative conclusions drawn from optogenetic manipulations are sensitive to both the details of the manipulation and the state of the circuit in which the manipulation is performed . 10 . 7554/eLife . 18383 . 025Figure 8 . Small changes in key parameters determine whether interneuron manipulations will produce consistent or paradoxical conclusions regarding interneuron function . ( a ) Top row: In a network with moderate baseline activity ( threshold = 0 ) , the frequency tuning curve ( FTC ) of a single input ( light-off: medium purple curve ) undergoes multiplication ( light-purple shading ) or division ( dark-purple shading ) . Middle row: The FTCs of many inputs ( light-off: medium colored curves ) , weighted by a Gaussian connectivity function , undergo multiplication ( light colored shading ) or division ( dark colored shading ) . Bottom row: These weighted inputs sum to produce the downstream neuron\u2019s net input . ( b ) The net input to the downstream neuron without light versus with light ( multiplication: light gray line; division: black line ) . The best-fit slopes and y-intercepts of these measurements represent the magnitudes of the multiplicative/divisive and additive/subtractive effects , respectively , on the downstream neuron\u2019s net input . ( c ) The best-fit slopes and y-intercepts from regressions on the measurements in ( b ) as a function of the strength of ( in ) activation ( i . e . , the magnitudes of the linear effects on the downstream neuron\u2019s net input as a function of the magnitudes of the linear effects on the input neurons\u2019 FTCs ) . Arrows indicate the strengths of interneuron ( in ) activation represented in ( a ) . Under these conditions , interneuron inactivation and activation result in multiplication and division , respectively , of the downstream neuron\u2019s net input . ( d\u2013f ) Same as ( a\u2013c ) , except the FTCs of the inputs undergo either addition ( light-purple shading ) or subtraction ( dark-purple shading ) . Yellow highlighted area in ( f ) indicates the range of interneuron manipulation that interacts with threshold nonlinearities . Interneuron activation interacts with threshold nonlinearities to transform subtraction of the inputs\u2019 FTCs into division of the downstream neuron\u2019s net input , resulting in asymmetric results between activation and inactivation . ( g\u2013l ) Same as ( a\u2013f ) , after changing one model parameter: increasing the baseline activity level of the model neurons ( threshold = -0 . 1 ) . Increased baseline activity levels require stronger interneuron activation to cause subtraction of the inputs to appear division-like in the downstream neuron\u2019s net input . This increases the range over which activation/inactivation will produce internally consistent conclusions . ( m\u2013r ) Same as ( a\u2013f ) , after changing one model parameter: decreasing the baseline activity level of the model neurons ( threshold = 0 . 1 ) . The weaker responses in ( m , p ) now lie below spiking threshold; this decreases the strength of interneuron activation required for subtraction of the inputs to appear division-like in the downstream neuron\u2019s net input ( p\u2013r ) . This decreases the range over which activation/inactivation will produce consistent conclusions .

The field cannot achieve this goal with correlative studies alone; causal manipulations are essential tools for conclusively linking interneuron subtypes to their respective cortical functions . Nonetheless , the assumptions and simplifications generally made when using these causal manipulations must be scrutinized . Given the surge in the use of molecular genetic tools to causally probe interneuron function , we tested whether one of the main assumptions underlying much of this work is true . Specifically , we tested the idea that differences in normal function between interneuron populations may be directly read out , and straightforwardly interpreted , by simply dialing interneuron activity up or down . In three different aspects of sensory processing within auditory cortex \u2013 the regulation of the gain , tuning , and information content of tone responses \u2013 we found that this intuitive assumption was not correct . Activation of Sst+ and Pvalb+ interneurons produced no significant differences in any of the three domains of sensory processing that we tested , even in cases where activation of interneurons caused equivalent and strong suppression , implying that Sst+ and Pvalb+ interneurons function equivalently in these aspects of sensory processing . In stark contrast , inactivation of Sst+ and Pvalb+ interneurons produced significant differences in all three domains: Pvalb+ cells appeared to increase information transfer through subtractive inhibition , whereas Sst+ cells appeared to provide divisive inhibition . That optogenetic activation and inactivation of interneurons did not produce symmetric results contradicts the intuitive notion that optogenetically increasing and decreasing interneuron activity necessarily strengthens and weakens , respectively , the functions these interneurons normally serve . How could optogenetic activation and inactivation of interneurons lead to these seemingly contradictory outcomes ? One reason could be that activation and inactivation of interneurons may differentially affect how the features of interneuron-specific inhibition are propagated through a network like the cortex . To help the reader reason through this phenomenon , we used a simple multilayered model to show that , when activating interneurons , network structure and threshold nonlinearities can convert either subtractive or divisive inhibition of a neuron\u2019s local inputs into divisive inhibition of a network ( Seybold et al . , 2015 ) ; yet when inactivating interneurons , multiplication and addition of local inputs may bypass these threshold nonlinearities and preserve their linear effects at the network level ( Figure 7 ) . Whether such asymmetric effects will occur depends on both the level of interneuron manipulation and the baseline activity of the input neurons . At high baseline activity , when cells spend much of their time above threshold , moderate changes in firing do not interact with threshold nonlinearities and , thus , the range of manipulation levels that produces symmetric effects expands . On the other hand , at low baseline levels , cells spend much of their time below threshold , and even small changes in firing will interact with threshold nonlinearities; thus the range of symmetric effects decreases ( Figure 8 ) . Importantly , this work suggests that optogenetic manipulations ( both activation and inactivation ) can be used as tools to reveal the operating range over which the network behaves linearly versus nonlinearly , with regards to any neuronal computation . This work goes beyond the previous work of our and other groups ( Douglas et al . , 1995; Litwin-Kumar et al . , 2016; Murphy and Miller , 2003; Seybold et al . , 2015; Tsodyks et al . , 1997 ) that identify discrepancies between the single-cell and network-level consequences of inhibition . Here our goal is different: to understand the interactions between increasing or decreasing inhibition and the innate properties of the network , as part of a larger program of clarifying the ways in which we can \u2013 and cannot \u2013 use optogenetic and other causal strategies to establish the functions of specific cell types . Another confound that could contribute to the asymmetric results from our experiments is that bidirectional manipulations may target a single population of interneurons that is genetically homogeneous , yet contains functionally heterogeneous subpopulations that respond to sensory stimuli in distinct ways . This consideration goes beyond the widely appreciated one that existing genetic targets may encompass several genetically distinct cell types ( Hu et al . , 2013; Ma et al . , 2006; Tasic et al . , 2016 ) . For example , from the viewpoint of a cortical pyramidal cell that receives inputs from several genetically similar interneurons , inactivation of these interneurons only suppresses neurons that are active during the stimulus . On the other hand , activation of these interneurons recruits most , if not all , of the interneurons \u2013 even those that are not normally activated by the stimulus . In this study , for example , a small population of the putative Sst+ and Pvalb+ interneurons fired weakly during the auditory stimulus ( with a mean firing rate of less than 5\u2009Hz ) , but dramatically increased their firing , often well above 30\u2009Hz , with light stimulation . Moreover , recent work suggests that cortical Sst+ and Pvalb+ populations may contain subgroups that are differentially driven by patterns of cortical activity ( Kwan and Dan , 2012 ) , stimulus features ( Runyan et al . , 2010 ) , and task-related behaviors ( Kvitsiani et al . , 2013; Lagler et al . , 2016 ) , suggesting that genetically-targeted activation of these cells may recruit more than one functional population . Thus , activation of these heterogeneous populations may strengthen different sets of functions than those weakened by their inactivation , leading to inconsistent conclusions regarding their normal function . Other issues related to the normal pattern of interneuron activity may also contribute to these contradictory findings . Firstly , both the temporal organization of interneuron activity \u2013 for instance response delays ( Gabernet et al . , 2005; Tan et al . , 2008; Wehr and Zador , 2003 ) or synchrony ( Cardin et al . , 2009; Hasenstaub et al . , 2016; Hasenstaub et al . , 2005; Hu and Agmon , 2015; Otte et al . , 2010; Sohal et al . , 2009; Stevens and Zador , 1998 ) \u2013 and the stimulus preferences of the interneurons themselves ( Atencio and Schreiner , 2010; Kerlin et al . , 2010; Li et al . , 2015; Moore and Wehr , 2013 ) are important for determining output . For example , in auditory cortex , Pvalb+ cells have been reported to be activated rapidly and by a broad set of tones , while Sst+ interneurons respond relatively slowly to a narrower range of tones ( Li et al . , 2015 ) . These features , however , will not be replicated in studies in which interneuron firing is indiscriminately and tonically increased or decreased . Additionally , activating or inactivating interneurons beyond a certain threshold may drive the cortical network beyond its natural operating regime ( for instance , by breaking inhibitory-excitatory balance [Ozeki et al . , 2009; van Vreeswijk and Sompolinsky , 1998] , pushing the cortex towards epileptic states [Chagnac-Amitai and Connors , 1989] , or close to silence [Hess and Murata , 1974] ) ; in other words , a given change in interneuron activity may have a different effect in a normally active circuit compared to an over- or underactive circuit . Given these potential confounds , the results of this study further support the notion that the precise way in which we use causal tools , and the brain states in which the manipulations are performed , will govern the conclusions drawn about neural function . These findings provide context for recent and future investigations of interneuron function . For example , recent studies in visual cortex in which interneurons were activated with ChR2 have produced diverse and even opposing findings regarding interneuron subtypes\u2019 contributions to the gain and tuning of sensory responses ( Atallah et al . , 2012; Lee et al . , 2012; Wilson et al . , 2012 ) . The findings from our model suggest that , in any of these studies , including our own , activation of Sst+ or Pvalb+ interneurons may have suppressed input cell firing below nonlinear spiking threshold , transforming , or obfuscating , the computational properties of interneuron-specific inhibition . Our inactivation experiments , on the other hand , mostly agree with ( Lee et al . , 2012 ) , and support the idea that Pvalb+ cells subtractively suppress responses and increase information content by suppressing irrelevant spikes , whereas Sst+ cells divisively suppress responses to modulate dynamic range . However , we stress the caveat that both cell types may perform these operations in cooperation with other cell types ( Karnani et al . , 2016; Lee et al . , 2013; Pfeffer et al . , 2013; Pi et al . , 2013; Xu et al . , 2013 ) and through complex network dynamics that we have not identified here ( Litwin-Kumar et al . , 2016 ) . Moreover , although it is often proposed that activation and inactivation of neuronal populations test their necessity and sufficiency , respectively , to support certain computations or drive specific behaviors , our results , along with previous work ( rev . [Allen et al . , 2015] ) , suggest that this interpretation may suffer from the same second- and higher-order network effects as described here . That we should be cautious in interpreting the effects of causal manipulations is not a novel idea . Recently , it has been shown that transient inactivations may not replicate the results of permanent lesion studies ( Otchy et al . , 2015 ) . This can occur because brief manipulations in one brain region may transiently perturb the computations of downstream circuits and , thus , may not reveal circuit function within a steady-state . Our finding that opposing optogenetic manipulations can produce apparently paradoxical conclusions regarding cell-type function adds to the growing sentiment that the ease with which manipulation experiments can be performed belies the difficulty of their interpretation . We propose that activation may be particularly likely to mask normal interneuron function because it targets interneurons that are not normally active during a stimulus response , and it is likely to obscure distinctions between linear transformations within a nonlinear network; conversely , inactivation targets only the normally active subset of interneurons and is more likely to preserve distinctions between linear transformation types within a nonlinear network . To dissect how interneurons act cooperatively or individually to control cortical function , even modern causal manipulations must be carefully designed and interpreted . \n All experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of California , San Francisco . To target our opsins to either Sst+ or Pvalb+ cells , we used Sst-Cre and Pvalb-Cre knock-in lines ( JAX strains 013044/RRID:IMSR_JAX:013044 and 008069/RRID:IMSR_JAX:008069 , with mixed C57BL/6;129S4 and C57BL/6;129P2 backgrounds , respectively ) . These strains drive expression of Cre in Sst+ and Pvalb+ interneurons of the cortex and hippocampus with minimal ( <10% ) leak ( Taniguchi et al . , 2011 ) . To produce mice in which we could either inactivate or activate interneurons , we crossed these Cre lines to either the Ai35 or Ai32 lines ( JAX strains 012735/RRID:IMSR_JAX:012735 and 012569/RRID:IMSR_JAX:012569 with C57BL/6 backgrounds ) , which , respectively , encode the light-gated hyperpolarizing proton pump Archaerhodopsin-3 ( Arch ) conjugated to GFP , or the light-gated depolarizing cation channel channelrhodopsin-2 ( ChR2 ) conjugated to eYFP , after a floxed stop cassette under the CAG promoter . For all experiments , we used adult male or female mice that were 6 to 12 weeks old . All adult mice were housed in groups of 2\u20135 under a 12\u2009hr/12\u2009hr light/dark cycle . Adult mice were deeply anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine and perfused transcardially with 4% paraformaldehyde ( PFA ) in PBS ( 0 . 1\u2009M , pH 7 . 4 ) . After removal , brains were post-fixed overnight in the same PFA/PBS solution and then transferred to a solution of 30% sucrose 0 . 1\u2009M PBS until they sank to the bottom of the tube . Coronal sections ( 40\u2009\u03bcm thick ) were cut using a freezing microtome and placed into a cryo-protective solution ( 30% ethylene glycol , 30% glycerol , in 0 . 1\u2009M PBS ) . Slices were rinsed in PBS solution three times for 10\u2009min , and then in 0 . 25% Triton X-100/0 . 1\u2009M PBS three times for 10\u2009min . After rinsing , slices were incubated in blocking solution ( 0 . 25% Triton X-100 and 10% normal donkey serum in 0 . 1\u2009M PBS ) for 2\u2009hr , and then overnight at 4\u00b0C in the primary antibodies: chicken-anti-GFP ( 1:500 , GFP-1020 Aves Lab RRID:AB_10000240 ) , and either rabbit anti-parvalbumin ( 1:1000 , RRID:AB_10013386 Swant , Switzerland ) or goat anti-somatostatin ( 1:300 , SC-7819 RRID:AB_2302603 Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Inc . , Dallas , TX ) diluted in 0 . 25% Triton X-100 , 10% normal donkey serum , in 0 . 1\u2009M PBS . Sections were then rinsed in blocking solution of 5% normal donkey serum , 0 . 25% Triton in 0 . 1\u2009M PBS three times for 10\u2009min and incubated in the same blocking buffer for 2\u2009hr , with secondary antibodies: donkey-anti-chicken-Alexa 488 ( 1:200 , 703-545-155 RRID:AB_2340375 Jackson ImmunoResearch , West Grove , PA ) , and either donkey anti-rabbit-Alexa 594 ( 1:200 , 711-585-152 RRID:AB_2340621 Jackson ImmunoResearch ) or donkey anti-goat-Alexa 594 ( 1:200 , 705-586-147 RRID:AB_2340434 Jackson ImmunoResearch ) . The sections were then rinsed in 0 . 1\u2009M PBS three times for 10\u2009min , mounted on gelatin-subbed slides , and allowed to dry . Then they were dehydrated and defatted with 50% ethanol for 2\u2009min , 70% ethanol for 2\u2009min , 95% ethanol for 5\u2009min , 100% ethanol for 10\u2009min , 100% ethanol for 10\u2009min , xylenes for 10\u2009min , and xylenes for 10\u2009min . The sections were immediately coverslipped using Krystalon mounting medium ( EMD Millipore , Gibbstown , NJ ) and dried overnight . Digitized images were obtained with a Nikon DS-Fi1 digital camera ( Nikon Instruments , Melville , NY ) on a Nikon ECLIPSE 90i microscope ( Nikon Instruments ) using a 10\u00d7 or 20\u00d7 objective . An initial surgery was performed 1\u20135 days prior to recording to affix a custom metal headplate over the temporal skull with dental cement . On the day of recording , a second surgery was performed to expose the auditory cortex . For both surgeries , mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and a subcutaneous injection of lidocaine under the incision site . As a post-operative analgesic , mice were given a subcutaneous injection of carprofen . An opening in the skull ( \u223c2\u2009mm ) centered over auditory cortex was drilled and then filled with silicone elastomer to protect the brain . Animals were allowed to recover from the anesthesia for 1\u20133\u2009hr , after which they were placed in a head holder on a free-spinning spherical treadmill ( modified from [Niell and Stryker , 2008] ) , after which the silicone plug was removed . Recordings were made using a 16 site linear probe ( 50\u2009\u03bcm spacing , Neuronexus ) , inserted perpendicular to the cortical surface . Stimuli consisted of randomly ordered 20 or 50 ms tones of various frequencies ( 4 kHz to 64 kHz , 0 . 2 octave spacing , 1\u2009s interstimulus interval , with the intensity level chosen as 10\u201315 dB above threshold at BF ) presented through a free-field high-frequency speaker ( ES1 , Tucker-Davis Technologies , Alachua , FL ) . In most experiments a second tone was played either 50 or 70 ms after the onset of the first tone for a different set of analyses . Thus only the first 50 ms of the first tone response was analyzed . On randomly interleaved trials , the cortical surface just above the probe was illuminated with blue light ( in ChR2 mice ) or green light ( in Arch mice ) through a 400-\u03bcm-diameter fiber optic connected to a 470 nm LED ( Mightex , Pleasanton , CA ) or a 532 nm laser ( IkeCool , Anaheim , CA ) , respectively . Recordings with blue light were performed with a light power near 15 \u03bcW ( range 1 to 25 \u03bcW ) , which typically suppressed firing to about 50% of the light-off condition . Recordings with green light were performed with a light power near 10 mW ( range 10 to 15 mW ) , which typically increased firing to about 150% of the light-off condition . The light began at least 50 ms ( up to 250 ms ) before the tone onset , linearly ramped up to full power for 50 ms , and remained on until 100 ms after the end of the stimulus . Each stimulus was presented 10\u201350 times with and without light . Responses were amplified and digitized continuously with a 16-channel recording system ( Tucker-Davis Technologies ) at 24 , 414\u2009Hz . Events in the recordings that crossed a threshold of 4 SD were collected and sorted using custom software in MATLAB ( KFMMAutosorter , written by Matthew Fellows ) to identify single units . Data were analyzed in MATLAB ( MathWorks , Natick , MA ) . Spike waveforms were characterized by trough-to-peak duration . The distribution of trough-to-peak durations was bimodal ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2 and Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2 ) , allowing us to group unit waveforms into narrow-spiking ( \u2264450 \u03bcs ) or broad-spiking ( >450 \u03bcs ) categories . Event rasters for each unit were constructed around each tone and used to produce frequency tuning curves . The response onset was calculated as the time a unit\u2019s response reached \u00bc of the maximum response , and the frequency tuning curve for each unit was defined to be the firing rate during the period between this calculated response onset and 50 ms after it , as a function of frequency . A unit was defined as tuned if the frequency tuning curve was significantly ( \u03b1 = 0 . 05 ) modulated by frequency , calculated using a 1-way ANOVA , and if at least three responses in both the light-off and light-on conditions were significantly ( \u03b1 = 0 . 05 ) above zero . The firing rate suppression or enhancement ratio for each unit was calculated as the percent change in spikes-per-trial during the response period , averaged over all stimuli . A unit was considered significantly suppressed or enhanced by the light if the number of tone-evoked spikes during the 50 ms response period across all stimulus conditions with light was significantly ( \u03b1 < 0 . 05 ) different from that without light . For Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3 and Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3 , we calculated baseline-subtracted tone-evoked firing by subtracting the average spontaneous firing rate , measured from 0 to 50 ms before stimulus onset , from the tone-evoked rates . For Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 5 and Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 5 , units from either ChR2/Sst and ChR2/Pvalb mice , or Arch/Sst and Arch/Pvalb mice were matched based on their firing rate ratios by selecting pairs of units between the two groups that were within a distance of a tenth of the range of all firing rate ratios . If a unit in one group did not have a matching unit in the other group within this distance , it was discarded . We analyzed linear transformations using standardized major axis regression , which is necessary to account for the measurement variance on both the x and y axis , which ordinary least-squares regression does not ( Sokal and Rohlf , 2012 ) . Only stimuli that elicited a firing rate significantly above zero in both light-off and light-on conditions were included in the analysis to avoid floor effects on spiking activity which could bias the regression and cause a subtractive effect to appear divisive . Units were deemed to show significant divisive or multiplicative transformations if the regression slope was significantly ( \u03b1 = 0 . 05 ) less than one or greater than one , respectively . Units were deemed to show significant subtractive or additive transformations if the regression y-intercept was significantly ( \u03b1 = 0 . 05 ) less than zero or greater than zero , respectively . Per-trial mutual information ( MI ) for each unit was calculated using the formula:I ( X;Y ) =\u00a0\u2211y\u2208Y\u2211x\u2208Xp ( x , y ) *log ( p ( x , y ) p ( x ) *p ( y ) ) where x represents possible values for the first variable ( e . g . , the frequency of the tonal stimulus ) , y represents possible values for the second variable ( e . g . , the number of output spikes ) , p ( x ) is the probability of observing x , p ( y ) is the probability of observing y , and p ( x , y ) is the joint probability of the two variables ( i . e . , the probability of observing xstimulus and y spikes ) . Because we have a limited number of trials from which to sample the stimulus and response probability distributions , MI might be upwardly biased . To account for this bias , we repeatedly ( 500 times ) shuffled stimulus-response pairs , such that each response was associated with a randomly chosen stimulus , thus eliminating information due to a real relationship between the stimulus and response , but retaining information due to a bias . We then subtracted the average of the shuffled MI values from the originally measured MI to obtain the bias-corrected MI . We applied this method to both light-off and light-on conditions separately . To calculate information-per-spike for each unit , we divided the information-per-trial by the average firing rate ( spikes-per-trial ) . Unless otherwise stated , all statistical values were calculated in MATLAB . Unless otherwise noted , distributions were plotted with boxplots , where the box represents the first quartile , the second quartile ( median ) and the third quartile of the data , the whiskers represent 1 . 5*interquartile range ( third-first quartiles ) , and the dots represents outliers lying beyond the whiskers . Statistical descriptions of distributions for the putative interneurons were reported as the median \u00b1 median absolute deviation . Significance of regression parameters for each unit was determined based on whether they exceeded the 95% confidence bounds , as in ( Sokal and Rohlf , 2012 ) . To determine whether changes in MI were significant for each unit , we performed a bootstrap analysis: we repeatedly ( 500 times ) randomly reassigned trials to the light-off and light-on conditions and recalculated the response metric for each reassignment . Effects were deemed significant if the observed effects were less than 2 . 5% or greater than 97 . 5% of the bootstrap-calculated distribution of effects . We used Wilcoxon sign-rank test to determine whether light significantly affected a population of units , Wilcoxon rank-sum test to determine whether continuous parameters were differentially distributed between groups , and a Fisher\u2019s exact test ( calculated in R ) to determine if the distributions of all linear transformation types were significantly different between groups . All tests were two-sided . We assumed a population of\u00a0N frequency-tuned input neurons In , each with a Gaussian tuning curve , systematically varying in their center frequency:In ( f ) =e\u2212 ( ( f\u2212n ) 22*\u03c3I2 ) These input neurons are connected to the target neuron by a center-weighted ( Gaussian ) connectivity function W:W ( x ) =e\u2212 ( x22\u03c3W2 ) The target neuron\u2019s total drive Inet , as a function of frequency , is thenInet ( f ) =\u2211nIn ( f ) W ( n ) The target neuron was assumed to be threshold-linear ( i . e . , its firing rate is proportional to its input , except that subthreshold inputs produce a firing rate of zero ) . Its output O is calculated by thresholding its total input against a threshold T:OT ( f ) =max ( 0 , Inet ( f ) \u2212T ) When input neurons are partially suppressed or enhanced , each input neuron\u2019s activity is calculated as:Inlion ( f ) =max ( 0 , m\u00a0Inlioff ( f ) \u2212b ) Here m and b represent the strengths of divisive/multiplicative and subtractive/additive inhibition , respectively . The target neuron\u2019s net drive , output , and change in responsiveness are then calculated as:Inetlion ( f ) =\u2211nInlion ( f ) W ( n ) OTlion ( f ) =max ( 0 , Inetlion ( f ) \u2212T ) \u0394O ( f ) =OTlioff ( f ) \u2212OTlion ( f ) For all conditions ( division , multiplication , subtraction , and addition ) , 101 neurons provided input to the downstream neuron , whose tuning curves had center frequencies linearly spaced from \u22125 to 5 , relative to that of the downstream neuron , and with standard deviation of 1 . Unless otherwise stated , spiking threshold was set to 0 . The connection weights of these inputs onto the downstream neuron decreased from a maximum of 0 . 2 , at the best frequency of the downstream neuron , according to a Gaussian connectivity function with a standard deviation of 2 . Divisive inhibition was then modeled by multiplying the input tuning curves by 0 . 5 , while multiplication was modeled by multiplying the input tuning curves by 1 . 5 . We modeled subtractive and additive changes in firing by subtracting and adding , respectively , 0 . 15 from the entire tuning curve of each input neuron . In Figure 8 , the baseline firing of the input neurons was varied by changing the spiking threshold ( i . e . , by adding or subtracting a constant to each Gaussian input curve ) . For moderate baseline firing , threshold remained at 0 , for low baseline firing threshold was set to 0 . 1 and for high baseline firing the threshold was set to \u22120 . 1 . The sample size of units was chosen to be consistent with similar studies in the field . The experimenter was not blinded to the genotype of the animal during recordings but was blinded to the genotype of the animal during the spike sorting process .", "headings": ["Abstract", "Introduction", "Results", "Discussion", "Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods"], "keywords": ["neuroscience"], "id": "elife-18383-v2"}
{"lay_summary": "Like an orchestra that relies on the coordinated efforts of its members , the brain depends on its many regions working together to perform tasks such as memorizing a phone number or the name of someone we recently met . Many areas in the brain that are involved in these processes are located far apart , and so performing these tasks efficiently depends on the regions being able to communicate and coordinate information . Rhythmic waves of electrical activity in the brain are considered to be essential to maintain the flow of information . These brain waves occur when many brain cells repeatedly send signals at the same time , and the precise \u2018beat\u2019 of the signals might be especially important when performing more complex tasks . In recent years , cheap and safe electrical stimulation has shown promise in being able to influence brain waves . This technique can be used to investigate the importance of precise timing between brain waves and its impact on performing tasks , as well as changes in brain activity that occur when tasks are more complex . For example , is a person\u2019s behaviour affected if electrical stimulation is used to make their brain waves more or less synchronized ? Violante et al . stimulated distant regions of the brain of volunteers and monitored how they performed in tasks with varying difficulty . When these regions were stimulated with the same \u2018beat\u2019 to make the brain waves more synchronized , the person performed better in the more difficult tasks . In these tasks , participants had to monitor number sequences , and spot repeated patterns in the remembered information . To better understand this effect Violante et al . performed brain stimulation while collecting brain scans . The scans showed that stimulation at the same \u2018beat\u2019 increases brain activity in the regions involved in task performance and changes the pattern of how regions communicate in the brain . This finding suggests that the \u2018beat\u2019 of brain waves is important for task performance , and that stimulating the brain externally can alter how regions in the brain communicate . Future studies could extend these findings to patients , particularly those with the kind of damage to their brain that slows the communication between its distant regions . Stimulating these patients\u2019 brains could help bypass the internal delays , and help them to complete everyday tasks more efficiently .", "article": "Cognitive functions such as working memory ( WM ) are emergent properties of large-scale network interactions . Synchronisation of oscillatory activity might contribute to WM by enabling the coordination of long-range processes . However , causal evidence for the way oscillatory activity shapes network dynamics and behavior in humans is limited . Here we applied transcranial alternating current stimulation ( tACS ) to exogenously modulate oscillatory activity in a right frontoparietal network that supports WM . Externally induced synchronization improved performance when cognitive demands were high . Simultaneously collected fMRI data reveals tACS effects dependent on the relative phase of the stimulation and the internal cognitive processing state . Specifically , synchronous tACS during the verbal WM task increased parietal activity , which correlated with behavioral performance . Furthermore , functional connectivity results indicate that the relative phase of frontoparietal stimulation influences information flow within the WM network . Overall , our findings demonstrate a link between behavioral performance in a demanding WM task and large-scale brain synchronization . \n Cognitive processes depend on coordinated interactions among large-scale distributed brain networks . Flexible and rapid propagation of information across distant brain regions is necessary to support these functions . A prominent hypothesis is that information exchange within and between networks occurs through the oscillatory synchronization of neuronal activity , such that synchronous neuronal firing binds neurons into ensembles engaged in specific computational functions ( Varela et al . , 2001; Fries , 2005; Womelsdorf et al . , 2007; Fries , 2015; Parkin et al . , 2015 ) . Rhythmic synchrony increases network efficiency , a process thought to be particularly relevant for demanding cognitive processes such as working memory ( WM ) ( Fries , 2005; Deco et al . , 2011; Fell and Axmacher , 2011; Fries , 2015; Constantinidis and Klingberg , 2016 ) . Frontal and parietal brain regions support WM ( Cohen et al . , 1997; Prabhakaran et al . , 2000; Pessoa et al . , 2002; Todd and Marois , 2004 ) . Oscillatory activity in the theta range ( 4\u20138 Hz ) appears to organize local neuronal ensembles across distant regions during WM processes ( Buzs\u00e1ki , 1996; Sarnthein et al . , 1998; Rutishauser et al . , 2010 ) . Theta power increases during complex manipulations of items in WM ( Sauseng et al . , 2005 ) , with increasing memory load ( Jensen and Tesche , 2002; Payne and Kounios , 2009 ) , and is correlated with WM performance ( Jacobs et al . , 2006; Fuentemilla et al . , 2010 ) . Moreover , the relative phases of these oscillations influence encoding and retrieval success ( Rizzuto et al . , 2006 ) . For example , frontoparietal theta synchrony with\u00a0~0\u00b0 phase lag is associated with the maintenance and manipulation of information in WM ( Sauseng et al . , 2005; Polan\u00eda et al . , 2012 ) . With the aim of providing causal evidence for the role of oscillatory synchronization during demanding WM performance , as well as to investigate the underlying neural mechanisms by which frontoparietal phase synchronization influences verbal WM , we conducted two experiments using transcranial alternating current stimulation ( tACS ) to selectively entrain endogenous brain rhythms ( Antal and Paulus , 2013 ) . In- and anti-phase theta frequency ( 6 Hz ) stimulation was applied across two key nodes of the right frontoparietal network: the middle frontal gyrus and inferior parietal lobule . Similar tACS stimulation has previously been shown to produce phase-dependent modulations of WM performance ( Polan\u00eda et al . , 2012 ) . In this study , we conducted two complementary experimental approaches . In Experiment 1 we used conventional continuous theta stimulation to investigate the role of frontoparietal phase synchronization on cognitive performance . Cognitive demands were varied by using a combination of choice reaction and N-back tasks of increasing difficulty . This allowed us to test the prediction that tACS effects would only be seen when cognitive demands were high . The right hemisphere was stimulated because increasing demand in verbal N-back conditions was associated with stronger activity and effective connectivity within the right hemisphere WM network ( Fedorenko et al . , 2013; Dima et al . , 2014 ) , as well as a more pronounced effect of tACS on WM performance ( Jau\u0161ovec et al . , 2014 ) . In Experiment 2 we investigated the neurobiological substrate of the phase dependent effects of tACS . Our fMRI-tACS experimental design used short trains of tACS that avoid aftereffects of the stimulation ( Vossen et al . , 2015 ) whilst maximizing power to detect changes in the blood oxygen level-dependent ( BOLD ) signal . Functional ( f ) MRI is well suited to this purpose because BOLD: ( 1 ) provides a measurement of brain activity during tACS without complex artifacts that can severely contaminate traditional electroencephalography ( EEG ) and magnetoencephalography ( MEG ) recordings ( Cabral-Calderin et al . , 2016; Vosskuhl et al . , 2016; Noury et al . , 2016 ) ; and ( 2 ) is unaffected by the phase of the applied stimulation . We tested the following hypotheses: ( 1 ) behavioral WM performance is enhanced by entraining synchronous activity within a right frontoparietal network activated by WM demands; ( 2 ) regional brain activity in this frontoparietal network is modulated in a phase dependent manner; ( 3 ) changes in BOLD induced by phase-dependent network stimulation correlate with behavioral performance; ( 4 ) functional connectivity across distant brain regions is modulated in a phase-dependent manner , in agreement with computational and empirical evidence that phase synchronization enables flexible reconfiguration of information flow between brain areas ( Womelsdorf et al . , 2007; Akam and Kullmann , 2014 ) . We found that synchronous ( in-phase ) stimulation caused an improvement in performance and led to increased frontoparietal activity when cognitive demands were high . These results show that external manipulations of large-scale brain synchronization can be used to shape activity and connectivity within brain networks , and those modulations are detectable using fMRI . We additionally demonstrate the important influence of underlying cognitive demand on the neural effects of tACS . \n In Experiment 1 , we investigated the effects of tACS on the performance of two tasks with varying cognitive loads: a simple choice reaction time task ( CRT ) and a verbal N-back task with 1-back and 2-back difficulty levels ( Figure 1A ) . Theta ( 6 Hz ) tACS was applied to the middle frontal gyrus and inferior parietal lobule nodes ( center electrode locations at F4 and P4 ) of the frontoparietal network in synchronous ( 0\u00b0 relative phase ) and desynchronous ( 180\u00b0 relative phase ) conditions ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1 for electrical field distributions associated to which condition ) . Ten healthy volunteers performed a session of each tACS condition ( synchronous , desynchronous and sham ) in a pseudo-randomized single-blinded cross-over design . The effect of tACS stimulation on reaction time ( RT , mean correct responses ) and accuracy ( percentage of correct responses ) was analysed using repeated-measures ANOVAs , with task ( 2-back , 1-back and CRT ) and tACS condition ( synchronous , desynchronous and sham ) as within-subjects factors . 10 . 7554/eLife . 22001 . 003Figure 1 . Stimulation parameters , behavioral tasks and RTs in Experiment 1 . ( A ) Participants performed the Choice Reaction Task ( CRT ) and 1-back and 2-back versions of the N-back task . In the CRT task , participants were shown left or right pointing arrows and were asked to press a button as quickly and accurately as possible to indicate the direction of the arrow . In the 1-back and 2-back tasks , participants were shown a single digit number ( 0\u20139 ) sequentially and were required to report a repetition of the digit occurring one or two trials before , respectively . ( B ) tACS electrode set-up . Electrodes were positioned at frontoparietal locations F4 ( middle frontal gyrus ) and P4 ( inferior parietal lobule ) with a common return at T8 ( middle temporal gyrus ) . TACS was applied at 6 Hz frequency with 0\u00b0 relative phase between F4 and P4 in the synchronous condition and with 180\u00b0 relative phase in the desynchronous condition . Stimulation was applied for the duration of the task except for the sham condition where tACS was applied for 30 s in the synchronous condition at the beginning of the task .

The electric field distributions on the cortex resulting from the two tACS conditions were calculated using a realistic finite element model as implemented in SimNibs 2 . 0 . In the case of the synchronous tACS condition three electrodes were included in the model: two anodes ( F4 and P4 ) and one cathode ( T8 ) . The desynchronous tACS condition was modeled with an anode and a cathode ( P4 and F4 ) , to reflect the cancelling of currents in T8 by the opposing flow of currents in the anodes . The localization of each electrode was defined by transforming the electrode center coordinates in MNI space to the space of the individual meshes ( native FreeSurfer ( http://surfer . nmr . mgh . harvard . edu/ ) RAS space ) . The electric field distributions were very similar across participants and are represented for a cohort ( n\u00a0=\u00a012 ) of the participants in Experiment 2 ( n\u00a0=\u00a024 ) . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 22001 . 005 For RTs , there was a significant main effect of task ( F ( 2 , 18 ) =45 . 47 , p<0 . 001 , \u03b7p2=0 . 84 ) , tACS condition ( F ( 2 , 18 ) =8 . 02 , p=0 . 003 , \u03b7p2=0 . 47 ) and task x tACS condition interaction ( F ( 4 , 36 ) =3 . 20 , p=0 . 024 , \u03b7p2=0 . 26 ) . This interaction was investigated in subsequent ANOVAs performed per task condition . Synchronous stimulation improved performance on the cognitively demanding 2-back task . A main effect of tACS condition on RTs was observed ( F ( 2 , 18 ) =7 . 65 , p=0 . 004 , \u03b7p2=0 . 46 ) . This reflected faster responses in the synchronous compared to both the desynchronous ( t ( 9 ) = \u22125 . 72 , p<0 . 001 , d\u00a0=\u00a00 . 76 ) and sham conditions ( t ( 9 ) = \u22122 . 43 , p=0 . 038 , d\u00a0=\u00a00 . 58 ) ( Figure 1C ) . In contrast , there was no difference between the RTs in the desynchronous and sham conditions ( t ( 9 ) = 0 . 76 , p=0 . 468 , d\u00a0=\u00a00 . 15 ) . These results partly replicate recent experiments showing that performance improves with similar synchronous stimulation , but also reporting impairment in the desynchronous condition ( Polan\u00eda et al . , 2012 ) . There was no effect of stimulation on RTs for the less demanding 1-back ( F ( 2 , 18 ) =1 . 11 , p=0 . 351 , \u03b7p2=0 . 11 ) and CRT ( F ( 2 , 18 ) =1 . 50 , p=0 . 251 , \u03b7p2=0 . 14 ) conditions , supporting a role for phase synchronization during demanding WM processes and ruling out a simple motor effect . To investigate the extent to which synchronous stimulation improved performance in the 2-back condition , we compared RTs between the 2-back and the less demanding 1-back condition . While the expected slowing of RTs was observed for 2-back relative to 1-back performance in desynchronous and sham conditions ( paired t-test between 1-back and 2-back: desynchronous tACS: t ( 9 ) = \u22124 . 19 , p=0 . 002; sham: t ( 9 ) = \u22123 . 41 , p=0 . 008 ) , there was no significant difference in performance when the synchronous stimulation was applied ( t ( 9 ) = \u22121 . 88 , p=0 . 093 ) . Accuracy was unaffected by stimulation , as no main effect of tACS condition ( F ( 2 , 18 ) =1 . 01 , p=0 . 383 , \u03b7p2=0 . 10 ) or task x tACS condition interaction ( F ( 4 , 36 ) =0 . 51 , p=0 . 730 , \u03b7p2=0 . 05 ) was observed . As expected , the repeated-measures ANOVA resulted in a main effect of task condition ( F ( 2 , 18 ) =15 . 20 , p<0 . 001 , \u03b7p2=0 . 63 ) , with the 2-back condition showing lower accuracy than the 1-back and CRT conditions ( 2-back: 83 . 9% \u00b1 3 . 7%; 1-back: 95 . 6% \u00b1 1 . 5%; CRT: 96 . 3% \u00b1 0 . 7% ) . In Experiment 2 we use simultaneous tACS-fMRI to investigate the neural correlates of the phase dependent effects of tACS . TACS was employed as a causal \u2018physiological probe\u2019 in an experimental design optimized to detect neurophysiological changes associated with the external stimulation . This approach is commonly applied in studies combining transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) with fMRI ( Driver et al . , 2009; Fedorenko et al . , 2013 ) or EEG ( Morishima et al . , 2009 ) , where BOLD responses are measured in a condition-dependent manner in the absence of behavioral changes . Twenty-four participants underwent a session of simultaneous tACS-fMRI ( Figure 2A ) in which they performed separate runs of blocked 2-back and CRT tasks , for both the synchronous ( 0\u00b0 relative phase ) and desynchronous ( 180\u00b0 relative phase ) tACS conditions ( N\u00a0=\u00a021 for 2-back task and N\u00a0=\u00a020 for CRT task , see Materials and methods for exclusion criteria ) . To measure the physiological effects of tACS , stimulation was delivered during task or rest blocks and balanced with non-tACS blocks in a pseudo-randomized order ( Figure 2B ) . The 2-back task was chosen because the\u00a0performance was sensitive to tACS and the CRT as it involves low frontoparietal recruitment , allowing us to investigate how tACS interacts with cognitive state . 10 . 7554/eLife . 22001 . 006Figure 2 . FMRI-tACS setup and stimulation protocol for Experiment 2 . ( A ) The two stimulators were controlled and monitored through a digital to analog converter ( DAQ ) . The stimulators were placed outside the MR shielded room and the current was delivered into the scanner room after being filtered from RF noise by two filter boxes . ( B ) In Experiment 2 , tACS was applied in a pseudo-randomized order during Task blocks ( 30s ) and fixation ( Fix ) blocks ( 20\u00a0s ) . The figure shows tACS applied at the synchronous condition ( 6 Hz , 0\u00b0 relative phase between electrodes F4 and P4 ) . The application of short trains of tACS was chosen to investigate the neurophysiological correlates of tACS manipulations on BOLD activity and connectivity . Each participant performed one fMRI run of each task ( CRT and 2-back ) and tACS condition ( synchronous and desynchronous ) . The order of the four runs was counterbalanced across participants . In each run participants performed 24 blocks ( that\u00a0is , , six blocks/condition: \u2018task\u2019 + \u2018tACS ON\u2019; \u2018task\u2019 + \u2018tACS OFF\u2019; \u2018fixation\u2019 + \u2018tACS ON\u2019; \u2018fixation\u2019 + \u2018tACS OFF\u2019 ) . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 22001 . 006 We assessed whether our results might be confounded by motion , heart rate or the subjective perception of different tACS conditions . Our fMRI data were carefully cleaned to remove motion and structured artifacts ( for\u00a0example , scanner artifacts , non-neural physiological noise , etc . ) by removing noise components using independent component analyses ( Griffanti et al . , 2014; Salimi-Khorshidi et al . , 2014 ) . Overall , there was very low movement in our sample ( mean framewise displacement ( FD ) for 2-back\u00a0=\u00a00 . 044\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00 . 013 , n\u00a0=\u00a021 , and CRT\u00a0=\u00a00 . 040\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00 . 011 , n\u00a0=\u00a020 ) and there was no difference in FD between periods with and without stimulation or for different tACS phase conditions for any of the tasks ( Repeated measures ANOVA for CRT and 2-back with factors stimulation ( ON , OFF ) and tACS phase ( 0\u00b0 , 180\u00b0 ) ; all F values\u00a0<\u00a02 , all p values\u00a0>\u00a00 . 2 ) . Similarly , heart rate ( available for a subset of participants; N\u00a0=\u00a06 ) was not different between periods with and without stimulation or between different tACS phase conditions ( Repeated measures ANOVA for CRT and 2-back with factors stimulation ( ON , OFF ) and tACS phase ( 0\u00b0 , 180\u00b0 ) ; all F values\u00a0<\u00a02 , all p values\u00a0>\u00a00 . 4 ) . In addition , analysis of post-experiment questionnaires showed that participants were unaware whether or not they were receiving stimulation and could not distinguish between the type of stimulation ( Materials and methods ) . \n Our results demonstrate that external manipulations of oscillatory synchrony across a right-sided frontoparietal network impact neural activity and modify behavior . The effects depend on the relative phase of the external oscillators and also the underlying cognitive state at the time tACS is applied . In particular , we showed that imposing theta frequency synchronously across the inferior parietal lobe and middle frontal gyrus improves verbal WM performance and increases frontal and parietal brain activity . The functional connectivity of the inferior parietal lobe was also modulated by tACS in a phase dependent manner . Frontal interactions increased with synchronous theta stimulation whereas posterior interactions increased with desynchronous stimulation , suggesting that information flow through brain regions involved in WM can be differentially affected by varying the phase of external stimulation . Therefore , we provide a direct demonstration of the role of phase synchronization in cognitive demanding WM processes and we showed the neural correlates associated with this process . It has been proposed that tACS interacts with ongoing oscillations and the resultant neural modulations spread along brain networks ( Fr\u00f6hlich and McCormick , 2010; Ali et al . , 2013 ) , with entrainment being more effective when the induced frequency matches the endogenous rhythm ( Fr\u00f6hlich and McCormick , 2010; Reato et al . , 2010 ) . This leads to the prediction that stimulation is highly dependent on the underlying network dynamics ( Alagapan et al . , 2016 ) . Our imaging results for the 2-back and CRT tasks strongly support these notions and show how the physiological effect of external oscillatory manipulations are highly dependent on the underlying cognitive state . While synchronous and desynchronous stimulation produced distinct activity and connectivity patterns in the 2-back task , they resulted in similar changes of activity and no effects on connectivity for the CRT task . Compared to the CRT , the 2-back task is more demanding and engages the frontoparietal network more heavily , which is observed both in terms of increased BOLD activity and theta power ( Payne and Kounios , 2009; Heinzel et al . , 2014 ) Our behavioral findings strongly suggest a causal link between theta phase coupling in the frontoparietal network and cognition . We replicate the observation that synchronous tACS applied across the frontoparietal networks improves WM performance ( Polan\u00eda et al . , 2012 ) , and extend these results by showing that this cognitive enhancement is dependent on the demands of the cognitive task . Our observations that tACS had no effect on less demanding 1-back or CRT tasks suggests that the behavioral effects of entraining oscillations interacts with the extent that a network is already engaged by a cognitive task . Remarkably , synchronous tACS produced sufficient improvement in response times to make 2-back performance similar to the 1-back condition , which is typically associated with much faster responses . Increased rhythmic synchrony across a network is thought to improve information processing by increasing network efficiency , an effect particularly important during demanding cognitive processing ( Fries , 2005 , 2009; Deco et al . , 2011 ) . For example , theta synchrony between frontal and parietal brain regions increases during complex manipulations of items held in WM ( Sauseng et al . , 2005 ) . Importantly , our neuroimaging results show the neural correlates of this effect on network efficiency . Entraining synchronous activity across the right frontoparietal network was associated with increased activity within the inferior parietal lobe and middle frontal gyrus , regions known to play a key role in WM function . Activation in these regions increases with WM demands and its damage leads to impairments of WM ( Curtis and D'Esposito , 2004; Berryhill and Olson , 2008; Fedorenko et al . , 2013 ) . In keeping with these findings , we show that increased activity within the right inferior parietal lobe correlated with faster responses during the 2-back , supporting a link between neural activity and the behavioral effects of tACS . This is in agreement with the critical role of this region during WM maintenance ( Constantinidis and Steinmetz , 1996; Pessoa et al . , 2002 ) , and the observations that disrupting its activity through transcranial magnetic stimulation affects performance in both spatial and verbal WM tasks ( Kessels et al . , 2000; Mottaghy et al . , 2003; Postle et al . , 2006 ) . Furthermore , during maintenance of items in WM the parietal cortex is positively associated with trial-by-trial performance and inter-individual differences in WM capacity ( Todd and Marois , 2004; Xu and Chun , 2006 ) . The fact that a relationship with response times was observed for the parietal but not the frontal region might be explained by the different roles attributed to parietal and frontal cortices in verbal WM . Evidence suggests that these regions have different contributions to phonological storage and executive control ( Paulesu et al . , 1993 ) . Moreover , our results are congruent with findings from other studies showing correlations between BOLD activity or connectivity density and response times in similar verbal WM tasks ( Honey et al . , 2000; Tomasi et al . , 2011; Liu et al . , 2017 ) . Thus , by increasing neural activity in the parietal region , tACS might have interacted with the physiological mechanisms associated with response production . Importantly , the changes in BOLD we observed were not constrained to regions close to the stimulation sites . Rather a more general effect across salience , visuospatial and basal ganglia networks was seen , which are all regions involved in WM performance ( Pessoa et al . , 2002; Owen et al . , 2005 ) . Interestingly , the stimulant drug methylphenidate has been shown to enhance WM performance and increase parietal activity in a similar verbal N-back task ( Tomasi et al . , 2011 ) , suggesting that cognitive enhancement produced pharmacologically or electrically may converge on similar neural mechanisms . As the maintenance of information in WM relies on the coordination of distant brain regions , the effects of tACS on functional connectivity may inform the mechanisms by which oscillations modulate long-range connectivity . During synchronous stimulation , functional connectivity increased between the IPL-electrode region and frontal parts of the frontoparietal network , that\u00a0is , DLPFC . Increased frontoparietal functional connectivity has previously been observed during WM processing ( Fell and Axmacher , 2011 ) , is associated with higher accuracy and faster RTs ( Prado et al . , 2011 ) , and is linked to increased theta synchrony ( Liebe et al . , 2012 ) . Our results extend these findings by showing how externally induced theta synchrony can increase frontoparietal interactions between the parietal cortex and DLPFC that are important for WM processing . This pattern was observed when the parietal region was used as a seed , but not for the frontal region . One possible explanation for this finding is that functional connectivity between the frontal and other brain regions was already operating at peak levels in the task periods without stimulation and could not be further modulated by tACS . A more intriguing possibility is that distinct frequency channels are responsible for carrying feedforward and feedback signalling . Such a distinction has been observed in the visual cortex , where feedforward influences are carried by theta and gamma band synchronization , while feedback influences by beta band synchronization ( Bastos et al . , 2015 ) . In this framework , it is possible that tACS applied at the theta frequency would differentially enhance feedforward connectivity across the synchronized fronto-parietal network . Studies combining tACS with electrophysiological methods could help explore this hypothesis . While synchronous stimulation resulted in increased functional connectivity between parietal and frontal areas , desynchronous tACS was associated with increased connectivity to occipital regions , which could suggest an increase in information exchange between higher- and low-level areas . The shift in parietal functional connectivity between frontal and posterior regions shows how altering phase synchrony might control long-range network interactions and so shape information flow . One interpretation of our findings is that high WM demands are normally associated with high levels of frontoparietal connectivity , and this can be enhanced by synchronous tACS applied across the network . Disrupting interactions across the network through desynchronous tACS increases parietal connections to the occipital lobe , perhaps as a result of the restoration of a \u2018default\u2019 pattern of functional connectivity normally observed in the absence of high levels of top-down cognitive control . This idea is supported by the notion that phase relations among neuronal groups could contribute to selective routing of information and shape effective connectivity , an argument supported by computational models ( Akam and Kullmann , 2014 ) and empirical evidence ( Womelsdorf et al . , 2007; Helfrich et al . , 2014 ) . Intracortical recordings show that altered phase relations between brain regions precede changes in neural activity , providing evidence that the influence of synchronizing activity across neuronal groups can be phase dependent ( Womelsdorf et al . , 2007 ) . Converging evidence that this can be externally modulated is provided by the observation that in- and out-of-phase tACS applied in the gamma band modulates inter-hemispheric connectivity and shapes visual perception ( Helfrich et al . , 2014 ) . Our study has a number of limitations . First , there is unbalanced electric field distribution between the tACS conditions ( see Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1 ) , which is a consequence of using a common return electrode . Thus , when current was applied synchronously to the frontal and parietal electrodes the temporal return electrode received the sum of the applied currents to each electrode , while in the desynchronous condition the current in the return electrode is cancelled by the opposing phases of the frontal and parietal electrodes . Nevertheless , although synchronous and desynchronous tACS resulted in different current distributions in the brain , our results could not have been predicted by a current density model . Modulations of brain activity and connectivity were predominantly restricted to areas involved in task performance and no effects were observed in the cortical area underneath the temporal return electrode . These results further demonstrate that the effects of brain stimulation cannot be determined without taking into account the underlying brain dynamics ( Reato et al . , 2013 ) and provide additional support for the critical neural state-dependency of tACS ( Feurra et al . , 2013; Ruhnau et al . , 2016 ) . Second , the area of stimulation was relatively large and potentially affected subregions with complex functional architecture and diverse effects on WM processing . Future work will need to use high-density multi-channel stimulators to improve the focality of the cortical effect of tACS . Third , the optimal frequency and phase is likely to suffer from inter-individual variability . However , the parameter space of possible stimulation regimes is very large and it is likely that other combinations of tACS parameters ( that\u00a0is , frequency , phase , intensity , etc . ) will produce greater effects on cognition . The key to unlocking the potential of this technique for clinical use will be to understand the neural mechanisms governing the cognitive effects of the stimulation . Machine-learning techniques combined with real-time imaging could help select the ideal combination of parameters to induce the desired modulation of brain activity/connectivity in a subject-specific manner ( Lorenz et al . , 2016 ) . Finally , while our fMRI approach benefited from good spatial resolution in the absence of complex electrical artifacts , we are not able to specify which brain frequencies were modulated by our intervention , as the correspondence between brain oscillations and BOLD signal is not fully understood ( Scheeringa et al . , 2011 ) and tACS might induce cross-frequency coupling ( Reato et al . , 2010 ) . Other studies have shown that additional forms of non-invasive transcranial electrical stimulation ( tES ) , particularly transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) modulate WM performance . The majority of these studies targeted the DLPFC and recent meta-analyses have indicated small but significant effects of tDCS on WM ( Brunoni and Vanderhasselt , 2014; Hill et al . , 2016; Mancuso et al . , 2016 ) . Broadly , these findings and ours show that tES is capable of modulating the neural processes associated with WM . But are tDCS and tACS acting through similar mechanisms ? Although tDCS uses direct instead of an oscillatory current to modulate cortical excitability , anodal tDCS applied to the DLPFC increased oscillatory brain activity in alpha and theta frequency bands in occipito-parietal regions during a verbal WM task ( Zaehle et al . , 2011 ) . This indicates that the local changes in neuronal excitability induced by tDCS produced interactive effects that resulted in the modulation of oscillatory activity in distant cortical regions . Although this shows that tDCS interacts with the neural mechanisms associated with WM , future studies should carefully consider the biological processes they aim to target , as different tES modalities impact brain excitability to different degrees ( Inukai et al . , 2016 ) . Furthermore , a recent study elegantly demonstrated that WM performance is very sensitive to the external stimulation parameters ( Alekseichuk et al . , 2016 ) . A study comparing different tES modalities could help answer this question . Such a study would benefit from applying a similar methodology to the one we employed , in which blocks of short durations of different tES modalities could be combined with fMRI . Overall , our findings indicate a direct link between behavioral performance in a demanding working-memory task and large-scale brain synchronization across a right frontoparietal network activated by the task . We showed how manipulations of tACS phase modulate the\u00a0underlying brain activity and that tACS can influence long-range connectivity in a phase- and brain state- dependent manner . More generally , our work shows the potential of performing simultaneous tACS-fMRI to understand the neural mechanisms underlying externally induced oscillatory synchronization . \n Experiment 1 included 10 healthy volunteers ( six females , age range: 21\u201340 years , mean age \u00b1 SD: 28 . 6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05 . 0 ) , all right-handed . In Experiment 2 , 24 healthy volunteers ( 21 new participants , nine females , age range: 20\u201335 years , mean age \u00b1 SD: 27 . 2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04 . 4 ) , 21 right-handed participated in the study . Two participants were excluded from Experiment 2 , one due to excessive movement in the scanner and another due to low accuracy in the tasks . Additionally , two other participants were excluded from the CRT analysis in Experiment 2 , one due to unreliable reaction times ( >20% of the trials had RTs\u00a0>\u00a01 . 5 SD above the mean for the subject individual RT ) and another due to a technical error with the recordings of the behavioral fMRI responses . One participant was excluded from the 2-back analysis in Experiment 2 due to low accuracy ( performance at chance level ) . Thus , for Experiment 2 our final cohort for the CRT task was composed of twenty subjects , three left-handed , seven females , age range: 20\u201335 years , mean age \u00b1 SD: 26 . 96\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04 . 34 , and twenty-one subjects , three left-handed , seven females , age range: 20\u201335 years , mean age \u00b1 SD: 27 . 38\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04 . 56 for the 2-back task . All subjects were educated to degree level or above , with no history of neurological or psychiatric illness . Participants gave written informed consent . The study conforms to the Declaration of Helsinki and ethical approval was granted through the local ethics board ( NRES Committee London \u2013 West London and GTAC ) . The sample size in Experiment 1 was chosen based on the effect sizes , between synchronous and desynchronous stimulation , observed in a previous study showing phase-dependent tACS modulations of RTs in a WM task ( Polan\u00eda et al . , 2012 ) . In Experiment 2 , the sample size was increased by approximately 50% to allow greater across-subject variability in BOLD related variables . Participants performed tasks with different levels of cognitive difficulty . In Experiment 1 participants performed two tasks , the choice-reaction task ( CRT ) and two versions of the N-back task: 1-back and 2-back . In Experiment 2 participants performed the CRT and the 2-back tasks in separate runs in a block design paradigm , with alternating periods of task ( 30 s ) and fixation at a cross ( 20 s ) . The CRT is a 2-alternative force choice paradigm used for testing general alertness and motor speed . Participants were instructed to respond as quickly and as accurately as possible , with the right or left index finger , to the presentation of a right or left pointing arrow ( size\u00a0=\u00a03 degrees of visual angle horizontally and 2 . 26 vertically ) ( Figure 1A ) . Each trial started with a fixation cross presented centrally ( size\u00a0=\u00a01\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01 degrees of visual angle ) for 350 ms , followed by a left or right arrow ( 1200 ms ) and then by a blank period of 450 ms . Participants performed 180 trials . The N-back is a WM task that requires on-line monitoring , and manipulation of remembered information . Participants were presented with a single digit number ( 0\u20139 ) sequentially ( Figure 1B ) . Each digit ( Arial font style , height was 2 degrees of visual angle ) was displayed for 500 ms followed by a fixation ( size\u00a0=\u00a01\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01 degrees of visual angle ) cross for 1500 ms . In the 2-back task participants detected a repetition of the digit occurring two trials before , whereas in the 1-back task they detected whether the stimulus matched the one presented in the previous trial . Target trials occurred in 25% of the trials . Participants performed 270 trials in Experiment 1 and 180 trials in Experiment 2 . Subjects were instructed to respond as quickly and as accurately as possible using their right index finger . Stimuli were designed using the Psychtoolbox ( Brainard , 1997 ) for Matlab ( Mathworks , Natick , MA ) . In Experiment 1 responses were collected through a custom-made response box and in Experiment 2 through a fiberoptic response box ( NordicNeuroLab , Norway ) , interfaced with the stimulus presentation PC . Stimulation was delivered using two MR-compatible battery-driven stimulators ( NeuroConn GmbH , Ilmenau , Germany ) . The stimulation electrodes ( 5 cm diameter \u2018donut\u2019 shaped rubber electrodes ) were positioned with their center locations at F4 and P4 and the return electrode at T8 , according to the International 10\u201320 system . Impedances were kept below 10 k\u03a9 using a conductive paste ( Ten20 , D . O . Weaver , Aurora , CO , USA ) , which also held the electrodes in place . Stimulation was sinusoidal , 6 Hz frequency , peak-to-peak amplitude of 1000 \u03bcA , and no DC offset . TACS was delivered in two different conditions: ( 1 ) Synchronous condition ( 0\u00b0 ) \u2013 Electrodes F4 and P4 with a 0\u00b0 phase offset and return electrode at T8; ( 2 ) Desynchronous condition ( 180\u00b0 ) \u2013 same montage as in the \u2018synchronous\u2019 condition , but electrodes F4 and P4 had a 180\u00b0 phase offset . In both conditions stimulation began with a 1 s ramp-up and ended with a 1s ramp-down . In the desynchronous condition the current in one channel was kept constant at 1000 \u03bcA after ramp-up for half a cycle . In Experiment 1 , participants performed one session of each tACS condition and sham in a pseudo-randomized cross-over design . Each condition was run in separated sessions at least one day apart ( range 1\u20138 days , mean 2 . 5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01 . 7 ) . Stimulation was administered for the duration of the tasks , starting at the beginning of each task and finishing when the task was over , total stimulation duration was 26 . 5 min . During sham sessions , tACS was applied in the synchronous condition for 30 s at the beginning of each task . In Experiment 2 , tACS was applied in a pseudo-randomized order for the duration of task ( 30s ) or fixation blocks ( 20s ) , where a fixation cross was presented centrally . The application of short trains of tACS has the advantage of allowing the measurement of many periods of neural entrainment without an increase of oscillatory power due to tACS aftereffects ( Vossen et al . , 2015 ) . Each participant performed one fMRI run of each task and tACS condition ( that\u00a0is , 2-back synchronous tACS , 2-back desynchronous tACS , CRT synchronous tACS and CRT desynchronous tACS ) . The order of the runs was counterbalanced across participants . In each run participants performed 24 blocks ( that\u00a0is , six blocks/condition: \u2018task + tACS ON\u2019 , \u2018task + tACS OFF\u2019 , \u2018fixation + tACS ON\u2019 , \u2018fixation + tACS OFF\u2019- see Figure 2B ) . Total stimulation duration in Experiment 2 was 20 min ( 11 min 36 s per run ) . A subset of participants ( n\u00a0=\u00a013 ) were questioned after each block whether they perceived the tACS stimulation; the question \u2018Have you had stimulation ? \u201d appeared on the screen for 4 s accompanied by the words \u2018Yes\u2019 in the lower right corner and \u2018No\u2019 in the lower left corner; participants were requested to press the corresponding button ( right for \u2018Yes\u2019 and left for \u2018No\u2019 ) . Experiment 2 was optimized to detect neurophysiological changes due to tACS by increasing signal-to-noise ratio and allowing computation of psycho-physiological interaction analyses . Stimulators were controlled and monitored through Spike2 software via a Micro1401\u20133 data acquisition unit ( both Cambridge Electronic Design , Cambridge , UK ) . The beginning and end of each stimulation block was controlled via an external trigger sent to the Micro1401\u20133 from the computer running the experimental paradigm ( which received TTL triggers from the MR scanner ) , this ensured that task and stimulation were synchronous to the scanner clock ( Experiment 2 ) . The experimental setup for Experiment 2 is represented in Figure 2A . In brief , the stimulators were placed outside the MR shielded room and the current from the stimulators was delivered into the scanner room after being filtered from RF noise by two filter boxes , one placed in the operator room and another inside the scanner bore , the latter was connected to the stimulation electrodes via a Y-cable . Phantom and pilot experiments were initially conducted to ensure that the experimental setup did not introduce artifacts in the fMRI signal . In agreement with previous studies ( Antal et al . , 2014; Cabral-Calderin et al . , 2016 ) the tACS montage employed in the study did not cause image artifacts . For each subject that took part in Experiment 2 we computed the electric field distributions on the cortex resulting from the two tACS conditions using a realistic finite element model as implemented in SimNibs 2 . 0 ( Opitz et al . , 2015; Thielscher et al . , 2015 ) . Briefly , different tissue types including white matter , grey matter , CSF , skin and skull were segmented and tetrahedral volume meshes of the head were generated using the SimNibs routine . In the case of the synchronous tACS condition three electrodes were included in the model: two anodes ( F4 and P4 ) and one cathode ( T8 ) . In the case of the desynchronous tACS condition the current in the cathode is cancelled by the opposing flow of currents in the anodes; this condition was modeled with an anode and a cathode ( P4 and F4 ) . The localization of each electrode was defined by transforming the electrode center coordinates in MNI space to the space of the individual meshes ( native FreeSurfer ( http://surfer . nmr . mgh . harvard . edu/ ) RAS space ) . The electric field distributions were very similar across participants ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . Before each experiment all participants were exposed to tACS stimulation for a short period of time ( <1 min ) to ensure that they were comfortable to proceed with the experiment . Participants were blind to the stimulation condition applied . At the end of each experiment , participants completed a questionnaire to assess possible side-effects of the tACS stimulation by rating from 0 ( none ) to 4 ( severe ) the intensity and duration of: pain , burning , warmth/heat , itchiness , pitching , metallic taste , fatigue , skin flush , effect on performance or any other side-effect perceived . Analysis of the tACS questionnaires for Experiment 1 indicated that participants were unaware whether or not they received stimulation ( 50% of the participants reported perceiving stimulation in the synchronous condition , 70% in desynchronous condition and 70% in the sham condition ) . In Experiment 2 , participants\u2019 demonstrated low accuracy for correctly detecting stimulation blocks ( 2-back task: tACS 0\u00b0\u00a0= 34 . 52% \u00b1 34 . 26; tACS 180\u00b0\u00a0= 17 . 86% \u00b1 26 . 52; CRT task: tACS 0\u00b0\u00a0= 41 . 03% \u00b1 27 . 73; tACS 180\u00b0\u00a0= 5 . 13% \u00b1 21 . 93 ) , which were explained by participants either perceiving stimulation during non-stimulation periods , or not perceiving the stimulation at all . The latter could possibly be explained by habituation due to frequent short trains of stimulation . Importantly , there was no difference between the accuracy for perceiving stimulation between the synchronous and desynchronous tACS conditions in the 2-back task ( t ( 13 ) = 1 . 59 , p=0 . 136 ) , indicating that our results were not influenced by participants perceiving the two tACS conditions differently . There was no significant difference between tACS conditions ( synchronous , desynchronous and sham ) for any of the side effects ( Chi Square tests ) , for Experiment 1 . There was no difference in side effects between Experiment 1 and Experiment 2 . None of the participants reported perceiving phosphenes . The pulse oximetry signal was acquired concurrently with fMRI using the integrated Siemens Physiological Monitoring Unit . Recordings were made using a photoplethysmograph ( 5 ms sampling rate ) with an infrared emitter placed under the pad of the right little finger . Registration to the fMRI images was made using a time stamp from the scanner\u2019s output file . Due to technical difficulties we only obtained time stamps for a subset of participants ( N\u00a0=\u00a08 initially and N\u00a0=\u00a06 after exclusion criteria , see \u2018Participants\u2019 paragraph above ) and therefore only those were analysed . Signal analysis was performed using in house scripts written in Matlab ( R2013b , MathWorks ) . Scanning was performed on a 3T Siemens Verio ( Siemens , Erlangen , Germany ) , using a 32-channel head coil . FMRI images were obtained using a T2*-weighted gradient-echo , echoplanar imaging ( EPI ) sequence , 3 mm3 isotropic voxel , repetition time ( TR ) 2 s , echo time ( TE ) 30 ms , flip angle ( FA ) 80\u00b0 , field of view 192\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0192\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0105 mm , 35 slices , GRAPPA acceleration factor\u00a0=\u00a02 , 348 volumes . Standard T1-weighted structural images were acquired using an MP-RAGE sequence , 1 mm3 isotropic voxel , TR 2 . 3 s , TE 2 . 98 ms , inversion time 900 ms , FA 9\u00b0 , field of view 256\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0256 mm , 256\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0256 matrix , 160 slices , GRAPPA acceleration factor =\u00a02 . Data preprocessing was performed using the FMRI Expert Analysis Tool ( FEAT ) Version 6 . 00 , from the FMRIB\u2019s Software Library ( FSL [Smith , 2004; Jenkinson et al . , 2012] ) . We performed motion correction using MCFLIRT ( Jenkinson et al . , 2002 ) , removal of low-frequency drifts ( high-pass filter of 0 . 01 Hz ) , spatial smoothing ( Gaussian kernel filter with a full width at half maximum of 6 mm ) , brain extraction to remove non-brain tissue ( BET [Smith , 2002] ) , and coregistration using FMRIB's Nonlinear Image Registration tool ( FNIRT ) to register the participant's fMRI volumes to Montreal Neurological Institute ( MNI ) 152 standard space using the T1-weighted scan as an intermediate . Single-session ICA was performed for each run using Multivariate Exploratory Linear Optimized Decomposition ( MELODIC [Beckmann et al . , 2005] ) . The resulting components were automatically classified into signal and noise using FMRIB's ICA-based Xnoiseifier ( FIX [Griffanti et al . , 2014; Salimi-Khorshidi et al . , 2014] ) . FIX was previously trained in an independent cohort of twenty individuals acquired in the same scanner with the same imaging parameters . Classifications were manually inspected and adjusted when required . Independent components classified as noise components were subsequently removed from each voxel\u2019s time series . Data analyses were performed using SPSS ( PASW Statistics Release 22 . 0 . 0 ) and Matlab ( R2013b , MathWorks ) . For the behavioural tasks we calculated mean reaction times ( RT ) and accuracy ( defined as the percentage of correct responses ) . Only correct RTs were included in the analysis . RTs were normally distributed ( Shapiro\u2013Wilk test ) for all subjects and all conditions , with the exception of one subject for the CRT task in the sham condition . Data from this subject was included in the analysis and excluding this subject did not change the results . Analyses of behavioural data were performed using repeated-measures ANOVA and missing data handled using listwise deletion . Thus , data of nineteen participants were included for the behavioural analysis of Experiment 2 . Effect sizes were measured by calculating the partial eta squared ( \u03b7p2 ) for repeated-measures ANOVAs and Cohen\u2019s d for post hoc t-test comparisons .", "headings": ["Abstract", "Introduction", "Results", "Discussion", "Materials and methods"], "keywords": ["neuroscience"], "id": "elife-22001-v1"}
{"lay_summary": "In warm-blooded animals , including chickens and humans , a single embryo can give rise to several separate individuals ( identical twins ) . Some species of armadillos routinely give birth to quadruplets in this way\u2014and in experiments , up to eight identical chick embryos can be produced by cutting one embryo into smaller pieces ( a type of \u2018experimental twinning\u2019 ) . This ability of a developing embryo to subdivide into separate individuals ends when the embryo starts to form its first midline structure , called the \u2018primitive streak\u2019 . This is the first line of symmetry and defines where the head\u2013tail axis will later develop . The steps that establish the axes of the embryo in birds and mammals , and the factors that prevent further splitting of the embryo to form twins after this point , are only just beginning to be understood . In chick embryos , the production of a protein called cVg1 is the first known step and precedes the development of a line of symmetry . A similar protein is produced in mammalian embryos and both proteins are members of an important family of signalling proteins . Now , Torlopp , Khan et al . have used a combination of techniques to search for other proteins that that control the production of the cVg1 protein . Genes that are active in the region of the embryo that will express cVg1 later in development were identified , both in normal embryos and during the process of experimental twinning . This search revealed Pitx2 as a protein that acts to switch on the expression of the gene that encodes cVg1 . When the Pitx2 protein is removed , the embryonic axis forms from the opposite side . Next , Torlopp , Khan et al . searched the chicken genome to identify stretches of DNA around the cVg1 gene where proteins that regulate gene expression might bind . Six potential sites were found , including four to which Pitx2 can bind . Further experiments confirmed that two of these regulatory sequences encourage the expression of the cVg1 gene at its correct position in the embryo . Pitx2 and related proteins were known to be involved with the development of left\u2013right symmetry later in development; the findings of Torlopp , Khan et al . reveal , unexpectedly , that these proteins are also involved in first establishing the position at which the midline of the embryo will arise . It remains unclear what prevents most embryos from forming twins . But Torlopp , Khan et al . 's findings could help to explain some strange observations , made long ago , about left\u2013right asymmetry in identical twins . For example , they could help explain why one of the twins in an identical twin pair is more likely to be left-handed than an individual in the general population , and why the direction of whorls of hair on the back of the head is often mirrored between identical twins .", "article": "Embryonic polarity of invertebrates , amphibians and fish is specified largely by maternal determinants , which fixes cell fates early in development . In contrast , amniote embryos remain plastic and can form multiple individuals until gastrulation . How is their polarity determined ? In the chick embryo , the earliest known factor is cVg1 ( homologous to mammalian growth differentiation factor 1 , GDF1 ) , a transforming growth factor beta ( TGF\u03b2 ) signal expressed posteriorly before gastrulation . A molecular screen to find upstream regulators of cVg1 in normal embryos and in embryos manipulated to form twins now uncovers the transcription factor Pitx2 as a candidate . We show that Pitx2 is essential for axis formation , and that it acts as a direct regulator of cVg1 expression by binding to enhancers within neighbouring genes . Pitx2 , Vg1/GDF1 and Nodal are also key actors in left\u2013right asymmetry , suggesting that the same ancient polarity determination mechanism has been co-opted to different functions during evolution . \n In most invertebrates and anamniote vertebrates ( fishes and amphibians ) , embryonic polarity is first established by localisation of maternal determinants in the cytoplasm and/or cortex of the fertilised egg . This generates differences between the blastomeres that will form by cell division from the egg , and which will culminate in specifying the orientation of the embryonic axes ( Wilson , 1898 ) . Separation of the first two blastomeres can lead to twinning: the formation of genetically identical , complete individuals ( Driesch , 1892 ) . Separation of blastomeres after the four-cell stage , however , does not generate twins; in most cases it interferes with development of even a single embryo owing to the removal of important determinants that have by then segregated to different cells . This is known as the mosaic mode of development . Among the vertebrates , amniotes ( birds and many mammals , and possibly also reptiles ) have a remarkably extended capacity to give rise to twins . Some species of the armadillo genus Dasypus generate quadruplets or octuplets from a single fertilisation event , as a result of two or more sequential \u2018splitting\u2019 events of the embryo at a stage when it is already highly multicellular ( Newman and Patterson , 1910; Loughry et al . , 1998; Enders , 2002; Eakin and Behringer , 2004 ) . Conjoined ( \u2018Siamese\u2019 ) twins occur in mammals including humans ( Chai and Crary , 1971; Vanderzon et al . , 1998; Kaufman , 2004 ) and are also seen in reptiles ( Cunningham , 1937 ) and birds ( Ulshafer and Clavert , 1979 ) ; most of these are thought to arise from splitting of the embryo relatively late in development ( Kaufman , 2004 ) . Perhaps the most dramatic example is seen in the chick , where cutting an embryo into fragments at the blastoderm stage ( when the embryo contains as many as 20 , 000\u201350 , 000 cells ) can lead to each fragment generating a complete embryo; up to eight embryos have been generated from a single blastoderm by experimental splitting , right up to the time of appearance of the primitive streak ( Lutz , 1949; Spratt and Haas , 1960 ) . The ability of higher vertebrate embryos to retain a regulative model of development until such a late stage strongly suggests that localisation of maternally inherited determinants is not an essential component of the mechanisms specifying embryo polarity ( Stern and Downs , 2012 ) . Moreover , since a single blastoderm can generate multiple embryos , mechanisms must exist that suppress this ability in regions of the embryo that do not normally initiate axis formation ( Bertocchini and Stern , 2002; Bertocchini et al . , 2004 ) . In chick embryos , the earliest symmetry breaking event known is the localised expression of cVg1 , the chick orthologue of mammalian growth differentiation factor 1 ( GDF1 ) \u2014a member of the transforming growth factor beta ( TGF\u03b2 ) superfamily of secreted proteins\u2014encoding a Nodal/Activin-type molecule that signals through Smad2/3 ( Weeks and Melton , 1987; Thomsen and Melton , 1993; Kessler and Melton , 1995; Seleiro et al . , 1996; Shah et al . , 1997; Kessler , 2004; Birsoy et al . , 2006; Chen et al . , 2006; Andersson et al . , 2007 ) . Before primitive streak stages , cVg1 is expressed in the posterior marginal zone ( PMZ ) , an extraembryonic region adjacent to where the primitive streak will form; misexpression of cVg1 in other ( anterior or lateral ) parts of the marginal zone is sufficient to induce a complete axis from adjacent embryonic cells ( Seleiro et al . , 1996; Shah et al . , 1997; Skromne and Stern , 2001 , 2002 ) . The mechanisms that position cVg1 in the PMZ are unknown . Moreover , when a blastoderm is cut in half at right angles to the future primitive streak axis , cVg1 expression spontaneously initiates in the marginal zone adjacent to the cut edge , in either the right or left side at equal frequency , foreshadowing the appearance of the primitive streak a few hours later ( Bertocchini et al . , 2004 ) . This observation shows that the mechanisms that position cVg1 are active in the blastoderm stage embryo . Here we take advantage of these observations to design a molecular screen for new genes involved in the earliest stages of specifying embryo polarity; together with bioinformatic analysis and embryological experiments we identify the transcription factor Pitx2 as a direct and essential regulator of cVg1 expression both during normal development and in embryonic regulation ( induced twinning ) . \n To search for putative upstream regulators of cVg1 , we took advantage of two of its properties: that it is expressed in the PMZ at early stages of development and that when a blastoderm is cut in half at right angles to the axis of the future primitive streak , cVg1 expression is initiated stochastically on either the left or the right corner ( adjacent to the cut edge ) of the isolated anterior half ( Bertocchini et al . , 2004 ) . We therefore performed two screens . First , we dissected the PMZ and an equivalent anterior explant ( anterior marginal zone , AMZ ) from 40 embryos ( in triplicate ) and analysed their transcriptomes using Affymetrix microarrays ( Figure 1A\u2013B , Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . At this stage of development , it is not possible to predict the polarity of the embryo with complete certainty . To prevent contamination of the samples , we designed a verification strategy by which the predicted posterior and anterior explants were collected , the rest of the embryo immediately fixed and then processed for in situ hybridisation for cVg1 , developing the colour reaction for long enough to detect residual cVg1 expression around the posterior explant site . From each set of 40 embryos , approximately 36 had been dissected correctly; the explants from the remainder ( 3 \u00d7 4 ) were discarded ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . Each set of verified PMZs and AMZs ( 3 \u00d7 36 of each ) was then pooled and run on Affymetrix 30K chicken microarrays . 10 . 7554/eLife . 03743 . 003Figure 1 . Microarray screens for upstream regulators of cVg1 . ( A ) Diagram of the first screen: the posterior marginal zone ( PMZ ) and anterior marginal zone ( AMZ ) were dissected from embryos at stage XI\u2013XII; the remaining embryo was then fixed and stained for cVg1 by in situ hybridisation ( ISH ) to confirm that the explants had been obtained from the correct regions . This was done from 40 embryos for each of three biological replicates , which were then run on microarrays . The diagram is accompanied by an example of an embryo after ISH . All 120 embryos are shown in Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1 . ( B ) Hierarchical clustering of differentially expressed genes for this experiment , and a plot of where cVg1-like probes ( enriched in PMZ ) are displayed in red and cVg1-unlike ( \u2018downregulated\u2019 ) probes shown in green across triplicate samples ( A1\u2013A3 for AMZ , P1\u2013P3 for PMZ ) . The scatter plot relates normalised log2 mean signal intensities and log2 fold changes of probes from both samples ( AMZ and PMZ ) . Probes identified as upregulated in the PMZ with a log2 fold change cut-off of 0 . 263 ( linear fold change 1 . 2 ) are displayed in red and those identified as downregulated in the PMZ with the same cut-off are displayed in blue . ( C ) Diagram of the second screen . An embryo at stage XI\u2013XII was cut in half at a right angle to the future midline; the posterior half was fixed for ISH with cVg1 to confirm the orientation ( an example is shown ) , and the isolated anterior half cultured for 7 hr . At this point , a small explant was dissected from the marginal zone adjacent to the left and right side of the cut , and the remaining anterior half-embryo fixed for ISH with cVg1 ( an example is shown ) . This allowed identification of the \u2018cVg1-like\u2019 and \u2018cVg1-unlike\u2019 explants , which were then pooled appropriately . This was done for 70 embryos for each of three biological replicates; all 210 posterior and anterior fragments are shown in Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2 after ISH for cVg1 . ( D ) Hierarchical clustering of the probes expressed differentially in this assay , and corresponding scatter plot; details similar to ( B ) \u2260V1 , \u2260V2 , and \u2260V3 correspond to each of the triplicate samples that do not express cVg1 and = V1 , =V2 , and = V3 correspond to explants that express cVg1 . ( E ) Venn diagrams showing the intersection of upregulated and downregulated probes common to both the PMZ and isolated anterior cut halves . A total of 122 upregulated probes and 78 downregulated probes were found to be common in both experiments using both p value and fold change as the criteria . The complete dataset has been submitted to ArrayExpress where it has been assigned the Accession number E-MTAB-3116 .

The 210 embryos used for the second screen ( lateral marginal zone from isolated anterior half embryos , cultured for 7 hr , then sorted into cVg1-like or cVg1-unlike expression ) . The procedure shown in Figure 1C was used . Embryos ( stage XI\u2013XII ) were bisected at right angles to the midline , the posterior half ( shown at the bottom of each panel ) fixed immediately and processed by ISH for cVg1 to confirm the orientation of the cut . The anterior half was cultured for 7 hr , a piece of marginal zone adjacent to the cut edge excised from each side , and the remainder of the anterior half fixed and processed for cVg1 expression ( upper image in each panel ) . The pieces corresponding to the side expressing cVg1 were pooled together ( \u2018cVg1-like\u2019 ) , and those on the opposite side pooled with each other ( \u2018cVg1-unlike\u2019 ) . Seventy embryos were used for each microarray , and the experiment performed in triplicate . The sets of embryo fragments shown here correspond to each of the three microarrays .

Analysis of microarray datasets for posterior marginal zone ( PMZ ) and isolated anterior cut halves . Volcano plots showing the correlation between p values and fold change of probes for each microarray experiment . The left graphs displays gene expression data from whole embryos ( PMZ vs AMZ ) , and the second graph displays data from the anterior cut halves ( cVg1-like and -unlike ) . Probes that pass a p value threshold of 0 . 05 together with a fold change cut-off of 1 . 2 ( 0 . 263 log2 ( FC ) ) are coloured red . Those that do not pass the p value threshold of 0 . 05 but pass the fold change cut-off of 1 . 2 ( 0 . 263 log2 ( FC ) ) are blue . Those that pass the p value threshold of 0 . 05 but not the fold change cut-off of 1 . 2 ( 0 . 263 log2 ( FC ) ) are green . The heat map on the right side of the figure uses hierarchical clustering to compare the 122 upregulated ( red ) and 78 downregulated ( green ) probes from the PMZ ( P vs A ) and the isolated anterior cut halves expressing cVg1 ( =V vs \u2260V ) . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 03743 . 006 Next , we used a similar strategy for isolated anterior halves of embryos . It was previously reported that cVg1 starts to be expressed in either the left or right corner of the cut anterior half around 6 hr after bisection ( Bertocchini et al . , 2004 ) . We chose to collect the left and right corners of the marginal zone adjacent to the cut edge 7 hr following bisection to ensure that surrounding cVg1 expression could be detected after excision of the fragment . To confirm that all embryos had been cut at exactly right angles to the future axis , the posterior half of each embryo was fixed immediately after cutting and subjected to in situ hybridisation for cVg1 . The anterior half was cultured for 7 hr , the left and right corners of the margin were dissected , and the remainder was fixed and processed for cVg1 expression ( with extended reaction time to detect weak expression ) . We estimated that 70 explants would be needed for microarray analysis of each sample; this was done in triplicate ( Figure 1C\u2013D; Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . Samples were designated \u2018cVg1-like\u2019 or \u2018cVg1-unlike\u2019 based on this and pooled accordingly . This strategy randomised any left\u2013right asymmetric genes unrelated to axial polarity and regulation , and enriched those for the cells in which cVg1 was just starting to be expressed de novo in one sample , and their contralateral equivalents ( not expressing cVg1 ) in the other . RNA from the pooled explants ( approximately 3 \u00d7 63 of each type ) was analysed using Affymetrix chicken microarrays . The intersection between the two datasets from the above screens was used to identify genes co-regulated with cVg1 , as well as those that are enriched in equivalent regions not expressing cVg1 , both in normal embryos and during regulation ( Figure 1B , D , E and Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3 ) . Using a threshold of just 1 . 2-fold change and p < 0 . 05 , this strategy identified 122 sequences ( corresponding to 85 genes ) with putative \u2018cVg1-like\u2019 expression ( a cVg1-synexpression group ) and 78 sequences ( 52 genes ) expressed more highly in the \u2018Vg1-unlike\u2019 explants ( cVg1 negative ) . A list of the top common genes ranked by fold change is shown in Table 1 . Comparison of the top \u2018Vg1-like\u2019 candidates from whole embryos ( PMZ vs AMZ ) with their counterparts from half-embryos shows highly significant correlation ( Spearman's rank Rho = 0 . 73; p = 0 . 00036 ) . Confirming that the screen was performed appropriately , cVg1 ( incorrectly annotated as GDF3 instead of GDF1 in the current version of the chicken genome , Galgal4 ) itself appears among the top genes: it is upregulated 4 . 3 fold , with a p value of 0 . 00006 ( rank 11 ) in whole embryos , and 1 . 71 , p = 0 . 0062 in the isolated anterior half ( rank 21 ) . Among all genes , Pitx2 immediately stands out as the best candidate , being very strongly co-regulated with cVg1 and the top transcription factor on the list . In the PMZ of whole embryos Pitx2 is upregulated almost 10-fold compared to the AMZ explants ( three different probes , ranking two , three and eight on the list; p = 0 . 0001 , 0 . 00019 and 0 . 003 respectively ) , whereas in the cut halves it is upregulated by about 2 . 4 fold ( three probes ranking four , six and eight on the list; p between 0 . 002\u20130 . 008 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 03743 . 007Table 1 .

S1_at2 . 8230 . 0025201 . 4060 . 028466List of the top 20 common upregulated probes expressed in both the PMZ of whole embryo and isolated anterior cut halves . Entries in red are probes that pass a fold change cut-off of 1 . 2 as well as a p value cut-off of 0 . 05; those in blue pass the fold change cut off of 1 . 2 but not the p value cut-off of 0 . 05; and those in black pass the p value cut-off but not the fold change . Common genes are ranked according to the fold change of genes expressed in the PMZ ( Spearman's rank Rho = 0 . 72 , p = 0 . 00048 ) . To confirm the microarray results , we examined 53 of the differentially expressed genes by whole-mount in situ hybridisation at pre-primitive streak stages X-XIII ( Eyal-Giladi and Kochav , 1976 ) ( 23 of these are shown in Figure 2 ) . Apart from Pitx2 three other genes show a similar expression to cVg1 at stage XII: Elk3 ( an Ets-domain protein also known as SRF accessory protein-2 ) , PKDCC ( protein kinase domain containing cytoplasmic protein ) and LITAF ( lipopolysaccharide-induced tumor necrosis factor-alpha ) . Others are expressed in cells adjacent to the PMZ ( and are therefore likely to represent early axial cells ) , such as ADMP , Brachyury ( T ) , Mixl1 , Tbx6 , FGF8 , and CHRD , or are expressed much later ( stage XIV ) , such as DENND5B . A final group is virtually undetectable , such as Thrombopoietin , Ovoinhibitor and PMEPA . All of these rank lower than Pitx2 ( see above and Table 1 , Table2 , Table3 , Table 4 ) : Elk3 ranks 17th in whole embryos and 43rd in cut halves , PKDCC ranks 7th in whole embryos and 33rd in the anterior half , and LITAF ranks 18\u201319th in whole embryos and 17th and 25th in anterior halves . Pitx2 is therefore the strongest candidate as a putative regulator of cVg1 . The \u2018cVg1-unlike\u2019 genes ( Figure 2P\u2013W ) give less obvious information . Comparison of the top genes identified from differential expression in whole embryos ( stronger in AMZ than in PMZ ) with their counterparts in the corners of anterior halves reveals weak correlation ( Spearman's rank Rho between \u22120 . 02 and 0 . 17; p = 0 . 44\u20130 . 93 ) . These genes include those encoding extracellular matrix proteins as well as glucose- , glutamate- , glycine- , GABA- and LDL transporters and receptors , the transcriptional repressor ID3 , and BASP1 , which has been reported to act as a transcriptional co-suppressor for WT1 ( Carpenter et al . , 2004 ) , among others . In situ hybridisation for these genes does not show enrichment in the AMZ or any other obvious pattern consistent with a putative role as an inhibitor of cVg1 expression in the PMZ at the appropriate stages of development ( Figure 2P\u2013W ) . Pitx2 therefore remains as the most likely candidate . 10 . 7554/eLife . 03743 . 008Figure 2 . Expression of \u2018cVg1-like\u2019 and \u2018cVg1-unlike\u2019 genes , verified by in situ hybridisation . Embryos at stage X\u2013XIII ( the earliest stage at which differential expression was detected is shown ) were processed using in situ hybridisation for genes co-regulated with cVg1 ( \u2018cVg1-like\u2019 , Table 1A\u2013B ( A\u2013O ) and genes expressed at lower level in the cVg1-positive region than in its counterpart ( \u2018cVg1-unlike\u2019 , Table 1C\u2013D ) ( P\u2013W ) , from the two microarray screens ( see Table 1C\u2013D ) .

Entries in red are probes that pass a fold change cut-off of \u22121 . 2 as well as a p value cut-off of 0 . 05; those in blue pass the fold change cut off of \u22121 . 2 but not the p value cut-off of 0 . 05; and those in black pass the p value cut-off but not the fold change cut-off . Common genes are ranked according to the fold change of genes in the anterior cut halves ( Spearman's rank Rho = 0 . 17 , p = 0 . 44 ) . To determine the temporal relationship between Pitx2 and cVg1 in whole embryos and during embryonic regulation , we compared their expression in time-course . In normal embryos cVg1 is first detected at around stage XI ( Bertocchini and Stern , 2012 ) . We detected Pitx2 in the PMZ by the time of laying , stage X ( Figure 3A ) , where it remains until early streak stages ( Figure 3B\u2013F ) . In isolated anterior halves , we increased the sensitivity of the assay by developing the NBT/BCIP colour reaction for several days to ensure that even weak expression could be detected . With this strategy we detected cVg1 expression 4\u20135 hr after cutting ( Figure 3L\u2013P ) , 1\u20132 hr earlier than in previous reports ( Bertocchini et al . , 2004 ) , while Pitx2 appeared even earlier , just 3 hr after embryo bisection ( Figure 3G\u2013K ) . Taken together , these results implicate Pitx2 as a good candidate for an upstream regulator of cVg1 expression: it is a transcription factor , it is expressed in the same domain as cVg1 in whole embryos and in bisected embryo marginal zone , and it is expressed before cVg1 . 10 . 7554/eLife . 03743 . 012Figure 3 . Time-course of expression of Pitx2 in whole embryos and in isolated anterior halves , and comparison with cVg1 . ( A\u2013F ) Time-course of Pitx2 expression in whole embryos . Expression is restricted to the posterior marginal zone ( PMZ ) already at the time of laying ( stage X ) ; this intensifies over the subsequent stages . At primitive streak stages ( HH2\u20133 ) , expression is seen in the primitive streak itself as well as in the PMZ ( F ) . ( G\u2013P ) Comparison of the time-course of Pitx2 ( G\u2013K ) and cVg1 ( L\u2013P ) upregulation in isolated anterior halves . cVg1 is first detectable 4\u20135 hr after cutting ( M ) , whereas Pitx2 can be detected an hour earlier ( G ) . Both Pitx2 and cVg1 expression appears randomly on the left or the right corner of the marginal zone adjacent to the cut edge . The series chosen for this figure shows upregulation on the right side of all embryo fragments . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 03743 . 012 To determine whether Pitx2 is important for embryonic regulation and for controlling cVg1 expression , we used targeted electroporation of morpholino oligonucleotides ( MOs ) . When a translation-blocking Pitx2-MO was targeted to the right edge of an isolated anterior half embryo , the frequency of axis formation shifted to the opposite side ( Figure 4A\u2013D; Figure 4\u2014source data 1A , B ) : embryos electroporated with control-MO at the right edge had random cVg1 expression on the right , left or neither edges in equal proportion . In contrast , Pitx2-MO on the right generated a majority ( 9/10 , p = 0 . 05 ) of embryos with no expression and the remaining embryo with expression on the opposite side 7 hr post-electroporation ( Figure 4B , Figure 4\u2014source data1B ) . After 16 hr ( Figure 4\u2014source data1B ) embryos electroporated with control-MO at the right edge formed a primitive streak expressing Brachyury randomly; with Pitx2-MO on the right ( Figures 4B ) , 8/10 embryos formed a streak on the left side and 2 had two streaks ( one from each corner ) , but no embryo formed a single streak arising from the MO-transfected side ( hypergeometric exact test with 2 \u00d7 3 contingency table , p = 0 . 026 ) . Equivalent results were observed with MO electroporations on the left ( Figure 4C\u2013D; Figure 4\u2014source data1A , B ) : control-MO embryos transfected on the left and examined for cVg1 expression had random expression on the right , whereas for Pitx2-MO cVg1 expression was biased towards the left . After 16 hr , control embryos transfected on the left formed a Bra-expressing streak on the right , again randomly , while Pitx2-MO embryos formed a streak on the right in 2/8 cases , none on the left , 1/8 on both sides and 5/8 with no streak ( p = 0 . 003 ) ( Figure 4D , Figure 4\u2014source data1B ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 03743 . 013Figure 4 . Pitx2 is required for cVg1 expression and for axis formation . ( A\u2013D ) A morpholino ( MO ) targeting Pitx2 applied to one side of the marginal zone of an isolated anterior half shifts axis formation to the opposite marginal zone .

The top row shows diagrams of the experiment , the middle row shows embryo fragments 7 hr after electroporation/cutting , hybridised for cVg1 ( purple ) and stained with anti-fluorescein ( in the MO , brown ) , and the lower row shows fragments processed for Brachyury ( T ) in purple and fluorescein in brown . ( E\u2013F ) In whole embryos , Pitx2-MO has a transient effect . At 5 hr , cVg1 expression is lost , at 12 hr a primitive streak ( T-expressing ) is sometimes seen especially at the edge of the electroporated domain , but by 16 hr embryos appear essentially normal . ( E ) Shows embryos electroporated with control-MO , F are embryos transfected with Pitx2-MO . ( G\u2013H ) . Embryos electroporated with MOs targeting both Pitx2 and Pitx1 do not recover: at 5 hr , no cVg1 is seen; at 12\u201316 hr there is a high proportion of embryos with either no streak or two T-expressing streaks arising from outside the MO-electroporated domain ( as shown in G ) . This effect can be rescued by co-electroporation of Pitx2 with the mixture of Pitx1-MO/Pitx2-MO ( H ) . ( I\u2013J ) Likewise , in isolated anterior half-embryos , the effects of electroporation of the Pitx1-MO/Pitx2-MO combination ( I ) can be rescued by co-electroporation with Pitx2 alone ( J ) : cVg1 expression is now seen on the electroporated side .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 03743 . 015 In intact embryos electroporated at stage X , Pitx2-MO affected cVg1 expression and streak formation ( Figure 4E\u2013F; Figure 4\u2014source data 1C\u2013D ) . Control-MO targeted to the PMZ did not alter cVg1 expression after 5 hr or streak formation after 12\u201316 hr ( Figure 4E; Figure 4\u2014source data1C , D ) . With Pitx2-MO , cVg1 expression was affected after 5 hr ( 0/6 embryos expressing; p < 0 . 001 ) . Embryos started to recover , however , at later time points: at 12 hr , 3/12 had a normal streak , 3/12 had a displaced streak , 3/12 had two streaks , and the remaining 3/12 had no streaks ( p = 0 . 1\u2014not significantly different ) . By 16 hr , the majority of the embryos were normal ( 7/8; the remaining embryo had a displaced streak ) ( Figure 4F; Figure 4\u2014source data 1D ) . These results suggest that while knockdown of Pitx2 affects cVg1 expression , embryos tend to recover by 12\u201316 hr . We reasoned that functional redundancy with another Pitx gene , or compensatory upregulation of such a gene in response to Pitx2 knockdown , could account for this recovery . To test this , we examined Pitx1 expression in normal embryos at stages X\u2013XII and in embryos electroporated with Pitx2-MO . Pitx1 is barely detectable in the PMZ at stage X\u2013XII ( Figure 4\u2014source data 1 ) . After Pitx2-MO electroporation , expression increased considerably ( 6/6 embryos; Figure 4\u2014source data 1 ) . We therefore repeated the targeting experiments in whole embryos using a mixture of two MOs targeting the translation start site of Pitx2 and an internal splice junction of Pitx1 , respectively . Pitx1+2-MOs caused loss of cVg1 at 5 hr in 6/6 cases ( p = 0 . 005 ) . By 12 hr 1/9 embryos had a normal streak , 3/9 had a displaced streak , 3/9 had two streaks and 2/9 had none ( p = 0 . 043 ) . By 16 hr no recovery was observed: 4/4 embryos had double streaks , neither arising from the targeted site ( p = 0 . 029; Figure 4G; Figure 4\u2014source data 1E , F ) . This effect could be rescued by supplying Pitx2 alone: co-electroporation of Pitx1+2-MO together with a Pitx2 expression construct lacking the MO target sequence led to normal axis formation: in 5/6 cases cVg1 expression was restored after 5 hr incubation and by 16 hr 12/16 embryos displayed a normal streak ( Figure 4H; Figure 4\u2014source data 1G\u2013H ) . Likewise in isolated anterior halves , the effects of Pitx1+2-MO ( Figure 4I; Figure 4\u2014source data 1I , J ) could be rescued by Pitx2 . After electroporation on the right , cVg1 expression was seen on the right in 4/10 , on the left in 3/10 , and in neither in 3/10 cases ( Figure 4J; Figure 4\u2014source data 1K ) . After 16 hr a primitive streak developed on the right in 3/8 cases , on the left in 2/8 and no streak in 3/8 cases ( Figure 4\u2014source data l ) . In conclusion , Pitx2 is required for expression of cVg1 in the PMZ as well as for formation of the normal primitive streak . In isolated anterior halves , Pitx2 is required both for cVg1 expression and for the later formation of a primitive streak . Knockdown of Pitx2 is followed by upregulation of the related transcription factor Pitx1 , which can partly compensate for the loss of Pitx2 . The cVg1 gene ( erroneously annotated as GDF3 in the chick genome; its orthologue is human GDF1 , as confirmed by synteny; see Figure 5 ) is located on chicken chromosome 28 . As a parallel approach to the above to identify putative upstream regulators , we applied a recently described pipeline ( Khan et al . , 2013 ) , starting with prediction of conserved , constitutive CTCF-binding sites ( CTCF is an 11 zinc-finger transcriptional repressor protein that co-localizes with cohesin and acts to delimit chromatin loops ) ( Holwerda and de Laat , 2013; Merkenschlager and Odom , 2013 ) around this locus which could act as insulators . This was followed by algorithms to identify conserved motifs in non-coding regions that are order independent , modified from the Enhancer Discovery using only Genomic Information ( EDGI ) tool described for Drosophila ( Sosinsky et al . , 2007 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 03743 . 016Figure 5 . CTCF insulator analysis , enhancer identification and synteny of the cVg1 locus . The chicken cVg1 locus with computationally predicted conserved CTCF-binding sites in chick , human , and mouse is shown ( genes represented in blue ) . This putative insulator region lies \u223c200 kB upstream and \u223c100 kB downstream of cVg1/GDF3 and harbours other genes such as CERS1/Lass1 , COPE , DDX49 and HOMER3 upstream and UPF1 downstream of cVg1 . Six putative enhancer regions ( E1\u2013E6 ) , predicted using DREiVe , are displayed in pink . In chick , E1 ( galGal4 genomic coordinates: chr28:3502783-3504834 ) and E2 ( chr28:3504993-3508041 ) lie in the first intron of the bicistronic CERS1/Lass1 gene . E3 ( chr28:3510154-3511032 ) and E4 ( chr28:3 , 511 , 413-3 , 511 , 725 ) lie in intron 4 of CERS1/Lass1 and E5 ( chr28:3471200-3471520 ) and E6 ( chr28:3 , 471 , 946-3 , 472 , 230 ) respectively lie in introns 1 and 2 of HOMER3 . E1 and E3 each contain conserved Pitx1 ( black ) and Pitx2 ( green ) binding sites . E2 and E4 do not contain any Pitx sites and E5 and E6 contain Pitx2-binding sites but no Pitx1-binding sites . The orthologous regions of human ( chromosome 19 ) and mouse ( chromosome 8 ) genomes are also shown . Note that the corresponding human region has been inverted , and that although all six elements are found within it , these appear in different order and are associated with different introns and intergenic regions than in chick and mouse .

Expression of Lass1/CERS1 , HOMER3 , COPE and UPF1 is shown . All are expressed posteriorly although the patterns are not quite identical to each other . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 03743 . 017 The insulator-predicting software identifies strongly conserved CTCF-binding sites about 200 kB upstream and about 100 kB downstream of cVg1/GDF3 ( Figure 5 ) . The cVg1/GDF3 gene itself is bicistronic , the upstream exons encoding Lass1/CERS1 and the last two exons containing the cVg1 sequence ( Wang et al . , 2007 ) . Several other genes lie in this region , including COPE , DDX49 and HOMER3 upstream and UPF1 downstream . If the predicted CTCF-binding sites are indeed insulators , we would expect these genes to be co-regulated with cVg1 . To test this , we examined their expression . Strikingly , all genes examined ( CERS1/LASS1 , COPE , HOMER3 , and UPF1 ) are expressed in a similar domain of the PMZ as cVg1 ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . We then applied the DREiVe tool ( Discovery of Regulatory Elements in Vertebrates , the vertebrate version of EDGI ) ( Sosinsky et al . , 2007; Khan et al . , 2013 ) , to identify de novo conserved sequence motifs around this region . This identifies six domains ( designated E1\u2013E6 ) , ranging in size from 600\u20133000 bases , located within the introns of CERS1/LASS1 and of the neighbouring Homer3 in chick ( Figure 5 ) . Analysis of these regions using Position Frequency Matrices from JASPAR and TRANSFAC databases together with the algorithms Matrix-Scan ( from RSAT ) and Clover predicts four of these regions ( E1 , E3 , E5 , and E6 ) to contain one or more putative binding sites for Pitx2 and/or the related factor Pitx1 ( Figure 5 ) . The power of DREiVe as a tool for discovering regulatory elements is highlighted by the observation that it is able to identify homologous non-coding regions in the human genome , where the syntenic region ( on chromosome 19 ) is not only inverted but also the orthologous elements are found in a different order , within introns of different neighbouring genes ( Figure 5 ) . In mouse ( chromosome 8 ) the arrangement is similar to chick ( Figure 5 ) . To determine whether any of the predicted regions bind Pitx2 in the PMZ of normal embryos , we conducted chromatin-immunoprecipitation experiments ( ChIP ) , assessing precipitation by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction ( qPCR ) analysis using primers targeting the predicted regions . We compared chromatin from the AMZ and PMZ ( Figure 6 ) . A monoclonal antibody against Pitx2 precipitated chromatin from the PMZ more effectively than from the AMZ for all predicted enhancers that contained consensus Pitx1/2-binding sites ( especially E3 , E5 , and E6 ) but not those that do not ( E2 and E4 ) . These findings suggest that Pitx2 is differentially bound to putative enhancer sites E3 , E5 , and E6 in the PMZ of normal embryos . We also tested each of the six putative enhancer regions for acetylation of Lys-27 of Histone-3 ( H3K27ac ) , which is associated with active enhancers ( Creyghton et al . , 2010 ) . Enhancers E5 and E6 showed the greatest differential activity in the PMZ relative to the AMZ . Together , these results suggest that E3 , E5 , and E6 are the most likely enhancers driving expression in the PMZ . 10 . 7554/eLife . 03743 . 018Figure 6 . Chromatin immunoprecipitation to test for active histone marks and Pitx2 binding to predicted enhancers . Relative immunoprecipitation around each of the putative six enhancers by an antibody to Pitx2 ( diagonal hatching ) or an antibody to acetyl-lysine-27 of Histone-H3 ( grey shading ) , expressed as a ratio of the amount precipitated from posterior and anterior marginal zone ( PMZ and AMZ ) chromatin . Primers were used to target each of the putative enhancers and precipitated chromatin measured by the quantitative polymerase chain reaction ( qPCR ) . Each data bar represents the average of at least three true biological replicates and the error bars indicate standard error of the mean . Amplification from input DNA from each of the same samples is also shown ( solid black shading ) . Note that enhancers that contain Pitx2-binding sites ( E1 , E3 , E5 , and E6 ) are precipitated much more strongly from the PMZ than the AMZ . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 03743 . 018 To test whether these putative enhancers do indeed direct transcription in the correct endogenous domain , we generated reporter constructs based on a vector designed by the group of Kondoh ( Uchikawa et al . , 2003 ) . Each construct contained one candidate enhancer ( E1\u2013E6 ) , a minimal promoter ( TK ) , and a reporter fluorescent protein ( EGFP or RFP ) and was electroporated either in a very broad domain including the PMZ and lateral marginal zones of normal embryos , or encompassing the entire cut edge ( including both corners ) of bisected embryos and the anterior half subsequently cultured . A ubiquitous reporter ( pCA\u03b2 with either EGFP or RFP ) was co-electroporated with each construct to reveal the extent of the electroporated domain ( Figures 7 and 8 ) . Embryos were then photographed live to reveal the electroporated and expressing domains , then fixed and processed for in situ hybridisation for cVg1 to determine whether the side with reporter activity corresponds to the cVg1 expressing region . In whole embryos , E3 and E5 are most efficient in driving expression of the reporter in the PMZ ( Figure 7 ) . The same two enhancers also drive expression in the cVg1-expressing side in isolated anterior halves ( Figure 8 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 03743 . 019Figure 7 . Enhancers E3 and E5 drive expression in the posterior marginal zone of whole embryos . Embryos were electroporated with a construct containing a candidate enhancer ( E1\u2013E6 ) , a minimal promoter ( TK ) and a fluorescent reporter ( GFP or RFP ) , together with a ubiquitous marker ( pCA\u03b2-EGFP or DS-RedExpress ) to reveal the electroporated area . After 5\u20139 hr culture the embryos were observed by fluorescence ( first 4 columns ) and then fixed and processed to reveal cVg1 expression by in situ hybridisation ( last column ) . The position of Koller's sickle is marked with a curved white line . Enhancers E3 and E5 faithfully recapitulate cVg1 expression in the posterior marginal zone ( PMZ ) , whereas E1 drives expression inside the embryo ( but not in the PMZ ) and the remaining enhancers show little or no detectable activity . In all cases , the electroporated area appears red and the activity of the specific enhancer construct in green .

Effects of mutations in Pitx-binding sites on activity of cVg1 enhancers in whole embryos .

Enhancer E1 is unaffected by mutation of either Pitx1- or Pitx2-binding sites , and continues to be active inside the embryo but not in the PMZ . E6 is also unchanged by mutation of the Pitx2-binding site ( no expression is seen from the intact reporter , see main Figure 7 ) . The activity of enhancers and E3 , E5 is destroyed by mutation of any of the Pitx1/2-binding sites . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 03743 . 02010 . 7554/eLife . 03743 . 021Figure 8 .

Effects of mutations in Pitx-binding sites on activity of cVg1 enhancers in isolated anterior halves . Each of the enhancers containing Pitx1- or Pitx2-binding sites was mutated either singly or , for those enhancers containing more than one discrete site , both together . The mutation is shown diagrammatically on the left column . Details as in Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1 . The specific activity of E3 and E5 is destroyed by mutation of any of the Pitx-binding sites . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 03743 . 022 To test whether the Pitx-binding sites are required within these enhancers to direct expression to the appropriate domain , we generated reporter constructs for enhancers E1 , E3 , E5 , and E6 containing mutations in each Pitx1- or Pitx2-binding site as well as constructs where all Pitx-binding sites were mutated . In whole embryos , mutations in either of the Pitx-binding sites ( Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013B ) or in both binding sites ( Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1C ) of E1 still showed GFP expression without selectivity , in the middle of the embryo . For E3 and E5 , however , mutations in either a single or both binding sites of each reporter completely abolished expression in the PMZ ( Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1D\u2013G ) . Un-mutated reporter E6 , which did not show any activity ( see above ) , was not altered by a mutation of its Pitx2-binding site ( Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1H ) . Similar results were found in isolated anterior half-embryos: mutations of any of the Pitx-binding sites in E3 or E5 completely eliminated expression in the cVg1-expressing corner of the isolated half ( Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . Taken together , these results suggest that cVg1 expression is regulated directly by Pitx2/Pitx1 binding to an enhancer ( E5 ) within an intron of the HOMER3 gene , adjacent to cVg1/GDF3 , and to an intronic enhancer ( E3 ) within the Lass1/CERS1 locus . The ChIP experiments suggest that Pitx2 binding to an additional intronic enhancer in HOMER3 ( E6 ) may also be functional in the PMZ , although this was not seen when a reporter construct containing this element was electroporated into the PMZ . The same enhancers ( E3 and E5 ) are involved in controlling cVg1 expression in the normal PMZ as in the portion of the lateral marginal zone where cVg1 is upregulated a few hours after isolation of a portion of embryo . These results implicate the transcription factor Pitx2 as the earliest gene described to date that regulates the position of the embryonic axis as well as embryonic regulation/regeneration and twinning . \n The PMZ of the chick embryo is the equivalent of the Nieuwkoop centre of amphibians: it can induce a complete axis including the organiser from neighbouring cells , without making a cellular contribution to the axis ( Azar and Eyal-Giladi , 1979; Khaner and Eyal-Giladi , 1989; Bachvarova et al . , 1998 ) . The Nodal/Activin-related TGF\u03b2 superfamily member cVg1 ( homologous to mammalian GDF1 ) is expressed in the PMZ . When ectopically applied to another region of the marginal zone , cVg1 is sufficient to initiate formation of a complete embryonic axis from adjacent embryonic ( area pellucida ) cells ( Seleiro et al . , 1996; Shah et al . , 1997 ) . To act , cVg1 requires canonical Wnt , which seems to be provided mainly by cWnt8C , expressed all around the marginal zone ( Skromne and Stern , 2001 ) . A target of cVg1 and Wnt is Nodal , transcribed in area pellucida cells next to the cVg1+Wnt expression domain ( Skromne and Stern , 2002 ) . The anterior end of the embryo also has an early identity , defined by the expression of GATA binding protein 2 ( GATA2 ) ( Sheng and Stern , 1999; Bertocchini and Stern , 2012 ) . However , unlike cVg1 , GATA2 is not a sufficient determinant of polarity and at best only acts as a bias ( Bertocchini and Stern , 2012 ) . While amphibian and teleost embryos lose their ability to generate complete , independent embryos if fragmented after the first few cell divisions , amniotes have huge regulative capacity . Dividing a chick blastoderm even just before primitive streak formation ( when the embryo may have as many as 50 , 000 cells ) into up to eight fragments can lead to formation of as many complete embryos ( Lutz , 1949; Spratt and Haas , 1960 ) . In an isolated anterior half , a visible primitive streak ( and expression of Brachyury and Snail2 ) can be detected about 12 hr after cutting . This appears randomly from either the left or right area pellucida adjacent to the cut edge of the marginal zone ( Spratt and Haas , 1960 ) , preceded at least 6 hr earlier by expression of cVg1 in the right or left marginal zone ( Bertocchini et al . , 2004 ) . Blocking cVg1 on one side of the marginal zone of an isolated anterior half will cause the axis to arise from the opposite side . A similar manipulation in the PMZ will cause a streak to arise from outside the MO-electroporated domain ( Bertocchini et al . , 2004; Bertocchini and Stern , 2012 ) . Thus , cVg1 expression in the marginal zone is both necessary and sufficient to initiate formation of a primitive streak . There was no information , however , about what positions cVg1 expression in the PMZ of normal embryos or in isolated fragments . This led us to undertake a screen for upstream regulators . We took two complementary approaches: a molecular screen , designed to identify genes co-expressed with cVg1 both in the normal PMZ and in the cVg1-expressing edge of the marginal zone in isolated anterior halves at the time when cVg1 first becomes detectable , and a bioinformatics-based approach , predicting and analysing putative enhancers of cVg1 situated on chromosome 28 . A particular difficulty of the molecular screen was that it is impossible to know , in a single embryo , which of the two edges of the isolated anterior half will express cVg1 . This required analysis of each individual fragment just after excising left and right edge explants , then pooling them appropriately according to whether they derived from the cVg1-expressing side or the opposite edge . This has the additional advantage of removing any intrinsic left\u2013right differences that may exist in the embryo at this stage . Selecting genes that are co-expressed with cVg1 when this is first upregulated at one edge of an isolated fragment , and also co-expressed with cVg1 in the normal PMZ , turned out to be a powerful strategy to reduce the number of relevant genes , thereby avoiding the \u2018cherry-picking\u2019 approaches often associated with molecular screens . This combination of molecular screens and bioinformatic analysis converged towards a single strong candidate: the transcription factor Pitx2 . The regulatory role of Pitx2 on cVg1 expression was then confirmed by loss-of-function experiments showing that Pitx2 is required for cVg1 activation and axis formation both in normal development and during embryonic regulation , and that it binds directly to four non-coding regions around the cVg1 locus ( E1 , E3 , E5 , and E6 ) , two of which ( E3 and E5 ) are sufficient to direct expression specifically to the PMZ and cVg1-expressing edge of an isolated anterior fragment . Moreover , mutation of any of the Pitx-binding sites in enhancers E3 and E5 abolishes the activity of these enhancers in the PMZ . These findings strongly implicate Pitx2 as a direct and essential regulator of cVg1 expression . Pitx transcription factors are characterised by possessing a Lysine residue at position 50 of the homeodomain , an unusual property shared with the vertebrate genes Goosecoid and OTX-1/2 and with the founder gene of the family , Drosophila Bicoid . In Drosophila , Bicoid is a critical specifier of \u2018anterior\u2019 identity and essential for setting up head\u2013tail polarity of the early embryo . Although it is tempting to speculate that a Bicoid/Pitx system may have an ancient function in the specification of head\u2013tail polarity , the Bicoid gene does not appear to have direct orthologues in species other than schizophoran flies ( closely related to Drosophila ) , so this may be either a coincidence or convergent evolution . The four key components that form part of this gene regulatory network initiating axis formation , Pitx2 , cVg1/GDF1 , Tbx6 , and Nodal , are also involved a little later in development ( from the late primitive streak stage ) in specifying left\u2013right asymmetry in different vertebrate classes ( Levin et al . , 1995; Hyatt et al . , 1996; Hyatt and Yost , 1998; Logan et al . , 1998; Meno et al . , 1998; Piedra et al . , 1998; Ryan et al . , 1998; St Amand et al . , 1998; Yoshioka et al . , 1998; Zhu et al . , 1999; Rankin et al . , 2000; Wall et al . , 2000; Levin , 2005; Raya and Izpisua Belmonte , 2006; Tanaka et al . , 2007; Hadjantonakis et al . , 2008 ) . Indeed , these are the main conserved components of the left\u2013right pathway among different vertebrates . These observations raise the possibility that the left\u2013right pathway may have evolved by co-opting a more ancient mechanism for initiating formation of the gastrular axis . This is supported by the finding that a Nodal/Pitx2 loop is involved in specifying both left\u2013right asymmetry and mesendoderm formation ( oral-aboral polarity ) in the sea urchin , a non-vertebrate deuterostome ( Duboc et al . , 2004; Hibino et al . , 2006; Warner et al . , 2012 ) . Pitx2 , Vg1 , Nodal , and Tbx6 are also involved in early mesendoderm development in anamniotes , although Vg1 is maternal ( Thomsen and Melton , 1993; Kessler and Melton , 1995; Faucourt et al . , 2001 ) . In the mouse , double mutants for Pitx1 and Pitx2 lead to early lethality ( at pre- or peri-implantation stages ) of the embryo ( Marcil et al . , 2003 ) . Only a single embryo was ever recovered that had survived to E10\u2013E12 ( Drouin , personal communication ) . Expression of these transcription factors has to date only been studied in detail at later stages of mouse development ( L'Honore et al . , 2007; Lanctot et al . , 1997 ) and it will therefore be interesting to see if they are indeed expressed as in the chick at pre-primitive streak stages . Certainly , the strong conservation of the active enhancers ( E3 and E5 , including the Pitx-binding sites contained therein ) near mouse and human GDF1 suggests that this is likely to be a conserved feature of birds and mammals , and despite the fact that the peculiar geometry of rodent embryos at these early stages has led to some differences in the processes leading to axis development ( Stern and Downs , 2012 ) . Monozygotic twins do not seem to occur commonly in the mouse and it is possible that these very small , cup-shaped embryos do not survive to term if more than one primitive streak appears within a single blastocyst . Together , these findings suggest that the retention of a regulative mode of development at late stages by amniote embryos ( that allows the formation of the types of monozygotic twins that arise relatively late in development , including Siamese twins ) evolved through novel uses of an ancient pathway , involved in both mesendoderm development and left\u2013right asymmetry , but in slightly different ways . Our study also brings forward the time at which the earliest responses to cutting an embryo can be detected . First , we can now detect cVg1 expression at one edge of a cut anterior fragment 4\u20135 hr after cutting , about 2 hr earlier than the 6 hr reported previously ( Bertocchini et al . , 2004 ) ; Pitx2 appears even earlier , 3 hr after cutting . But this also begs the question of what lies upstream of Pitx2 . At some early point in the cascade , the regulators will no longer be controlled at the transcriptional level and it will be considerably more difficult to identify them . The present finding that Pitx2 is upregulated locally just 3 hr after cutting an embryo suggests that its regulators may not be differentially expressed mRNAs , but other asymmetries . Our studies allow us to predict the Pitx2/cVg1 ( GDF1 ) /Nodal pathway as a possible candidate to explain the obligate quadruplets of armadillos ( Newman and Patterson , 1910; Loughry et al . , 1998; Enders , 2002; Eakin and Behringer , 2004 ) and/or the high incidence of monozygotic and conjoined twins in certain human populations ( Cox , 1963; Hamamy et al . , 2004; Forsberg et al . , 2010 ) . Answering these questions represent interesting future challenges . \n Fertile Brown Bovan Gold hens' eggs ( Henry Stewart , UK ) were incubated for 1\u201316 hr to obtain stages X\u2013XIII ( Eyal-Giladi and Kochav , 1976 ) and stage 4 ( Hamburger and Hamilton , 1951 ) ( HH ) . Embryo manipulation was performed in Tyrode's solution . Anterior halves were obtained by cutting embryos with a hair loop . Unlike previous studies ( Bertocchini et al . , 2004 ) , here we did not use a strip of anterior area opaca to seal the cut edge . Embryos and fragments were set up in modified New culture ( New , 1955; Stern and Ireland , 1981 ) and incubated at 38\u00b0C as required . Whole mount in situ hybridisation was performed as described previously ( Stern , 1998; Streit and Stern , 2001 ) . The probes used were: chick cVg1 ( Shah et al . , 1997 ) , Brachyury ( Kispert et al . , 1995a; Kispert et al . , 1995b; Knezevic et al . , 1997 ) , and Pitx2 ( Logan et al . , 1998; Zhu et al . , 1999 ) . Two microarray screens were performed with tissues collected from stages X\u2013XII ( Eyal-Giladi and Kochav , 1976 ) . A first screen was performed with triplicates of 40 pieces of PMZ and AMZ , dissected and individually frozen from whole embryos ( Figure 1A , Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . A second screen was done with triplicates of 70 pieces of the left and right corners of the marginal zone , dissected and frozen individually from anterior embryo halves that had been cultured for 7 hr ( Figure 1C , Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . After dissection , whole embryos and anterior halves were fixed in 4% PFA for in situ hybridisation with cVg1 . In both screens , in situ hybridisation was carried out for an extended period to detect low cVg1 expression adjacent to the excised pieces and confirm the orientation of the embryo ( see Results ) ; the orientation was ambiguous or incorrect in about 10% of the embryos , and explants obtained from them were therefore not included . The remaining validated PMZ and AMZ samples , cVg1-like and non-cVg1-like samples were pooled in TRIzol reagent ( Ambion , Invitrogen , UK ) . RNA was prepared and run for a complete Affymetrix analysis by ARK-Genomics . 500 ng of total RNA was required for the standard 3' IVT-Express protocol . Each label was quality checked through all stages of amplification and preparation for hybridisation on Affymetrix 30K chicken microarrays . Microarray raw data were analysed using Bioconductor in R ( Gentleman et al . , 2004 ) . Raw datasets were normalised using the Robust Multi-array Average ( RMA ) method ( Irizarry et al . , 2003 ) . Differentially expressed genes were then identified using the Limma package in R ( Smyth , 2005 ) with a fold change threshold of 1 . 2 and p < 0 . 05 . This strategy identified 122 sequences ( corresponding to 85 genes ) with putative cVg1-like expression ( \u2018cVg1-like\u2019 ) and 78 sequences ( 52 genes ) expressed in the cVg1-negative explants ( \u2018cVg1-unlike\u2019 ) . The complete dataset was deposited with ArrayExpress where it can be accessed under Accession number E-MTAB-3116 . A selection of genes from the top up- and downregulated genes was verified by in situ hybridisation: ADMP , PITX2 , THPO , PKDCC , PMEPA , TBX6 , FGF8 , Ovoinhibitor , ELK3 , LITAF , PITX1 , CAMK1G , DENND5B , MLLT6 , Homer3 , SEMA5B , PIK3R1 , GALNTL1 , SH2D4A , GLI3 , PDLIM5 , VANGL1 , LEF1 , FGF18 , LOC768709 , CXCL14 , PLCB1 , ZBTB1 , MED15 , SPOCK3 , BASP1 , LRP2 , GABRB2 , PDGFA , Autotaxin , SALL1 , MAFA , ESRRG , FOXD2 , FSTL4 , MALT1 , OLFM3 , GNAZ and GRB10; when not already available , probes were generated from the chick EST collection ( Boardman et al . , 2002 ) . Computational prediction of CTCF insulator elements was performed as previously described ( Khan et al . , 2013 ) . A PERL script ( http://www . ncbi . nlm . nih . gov/pmc/articles/PMC3664090/#SD1 ) was used to scan chromosome 28 ( location of GDF3/cVg1 ) from the galGal4 build of the chicken genome for occurrences of CTCF-binding sites with stringent parameters ( False Discovery Rate , FDR 0% ) . Equivalent regions of human chromosome 19 ( hg19 genome build , location of homologous GDF1 ) and mouse chromosome 8 ( mm10 genome build , location of homologous GDF1 ) were also scanned for CTCF-binding sites with the same FDR parameter . The nearest conserved CTCF-binding sites harbouring the same set of genes both upstream and downstream of GDF3/GDF1 in all three species were then identified and these domains were defined as regions bounded by putative insulators . Enhancer prediction was carried out using the software package Discovery of Regulatory Elements in Vertebrates ( DREiVe ) ( Khan et al . , 2013 ) , the vertebrate version of EDGI ( Sosinsky et al . , 2007 ) . Genomic coordinates for the predicted insulator region in human were used as the reference to predict order-independent conserved patterns of DNA sequences shared between human and any seven of the following species: horse ( Equcab2 ) , cow ( Bostau4 ) , rabbit ( Orycun2 ) , guinea pig ( Cavpor3 ) , mouse ( mm9 ) , opossum ( Mondom5 ) , platypus ( Taegut1 ) , chicken ( Galgal3 ) , and lizard ( Anocar1 ) . Parameters used included motif density of 6 matching nucleotides within a window length of 8 bp , where the minimum number of matching nucleotides in the motifs was set at 12 bp . The maximal cluster length ( maximum length of predicted enhancers ) was set at 3000 bp with a sequence conservation score cut-off of 2 . This set of parameters successfully predicted a series of conserved blocks , designated E1\u2013E4 ( see Figure 5 ) , in human , chicken , mouse , and other species . Transcription factor binding site analysis of these predicted enhancers was carried out using the matrix-scan algorithm from the RSAT workbench ( http://rsat . ulb . ac . be/rsat/ ) ( Thomas-Chollier et al . , 2011 ) . Position frequency matrices from both Jaspar ( http://jaspar . cgb . ki . se/ ) and Transfac ( http://www . gene-regulation . com/pub/databases . html ) libraries were used in matrix-scan where the background model estimation method was based on a Markov order of 0 . Organism-specific \u2018upstream no-orf\u2019 background sequences were used ( galGal4 ) with a pseudo-frequency of 0 . 01 and an upper p-value threshold of 1e\u22124 . As a complementary approach , a modified methodology of Clover ( http://cagt . bu . edu/page/Clover_about ) was used to detect enhancers that shared order-independent transcription factor binding sites rather than DNA patterns . This approach uncovered two additional putative enhancers , E5 and E6 . Fluorescein-labelled MOs against Pitx2 , Pitx1 and a standard control-MO ( Gene Tools , Philomath , Oregon , USA ) were delivered to young embryos by electroporation as described ( Voiculescu et al . , 2007; Voiculescu et al . , 2008 ) . Pitx2-MO was designed to target the translational start site: ( 5\u2032-CAAGTTTACGGCAGTTGGACTCCAT-3\u2032 ) . A splice blocking Pitx1-MO was designed to target the start of exon-2: ( 5\u2032-CTCTCTTTTTCTACGGTGGGATGTT-3\u2032 ) . The coding sequence of chicken Pitx2 ( Logan et al . , 1998 ) was cloned into pCA\u03b2-IRES-GFP to generate a Pitx2 expression construct . The expression of Pitx2 protein was confirmed by western blot with a Pitx2-antibody ( Abcam , UK , ab55599 ) . Candidate enhancers 1\u20136 ( E1\u2013E6 ) were amplified from chick genomic DNA using the following primer pairs: ( E1 ) -forward ( 5\u2032-CAGCCCCAGGCAGACAGGGCTGCAGGGAAGAAGGGG-3\u2032 ) , reverse ( 5\u2032-ACGGGACCCCCAGCCCTGCAGGATGCTGCCCGGGGT-3\u2032 ) ; ( E2 ) -forward ( 5\u2032-GGAGGTACCATAATTCATGCTTTCTGGGCTCGGGAC-3\u2032 ) , reverse ( 5\u2032-GTACTCGAGCAAAGGTATCCCAGACCCTGCTGTC-3\u2032 ) ; ( E3 ) -forward ( 5\u2032- GGAGGTACCACTCATTTGGTTTTAGCATTAATAAAC-3\u2032 ) , reverse ( 5\u2032- GTACTCGAGCTGCCAGGGCAGAGGGAGCAGGGTG-3\u2032 ) ; ( E4 ) -forward ( 5\u2032-CAGGGGATGAAGGGGGTGTTGGGGATCAAGCTCTTC-3\u2032 ) , reverse ( 5\u2032-CAGTCTGCTACAATCCCTTCCCATGGATTCCTGGGG -3\u2032 ) ; ( E5 ) -forward ( 5\u2032-GTGAGGTACCCTGTTCAGTC-3\u2032 ) , reverse ( 5\u2032- AACTCGAGGTACAAGCTCTGC -3\u2032 ) ; ( E6 ) -forward ( 5\u2032-GGTAGAGACCTGGTACCAGTAG-3\u2032 ) , reverse ( 5\u2032-GAAGGGAGCTCGAGTGTCAC -3\u2032 ) . The amplified fragments were subcloned into pGEMT-easy ( Promega , Madison , Wisconsin , USA ) , excised with inserted KpnI and XhoI sites and cloned into ptkEGFP ( Uchikawa et al . , 2003 ) or ptkRFP ( kind gifts of H Kondoh ) . All constructs were checked by sequencing . 3 \u00b5g of each enhancer construct were co-electroporated with pCA\u03b2-RFP , DS-RedExpress ( Invitrogen , UK ) or pCA\u03b2-IRES-GFP as appropriate . Mutations were introduced into each of the Pitx1- or Pitx2-binding sites of the four enhancers ( E1 , E3 , E5 , and E6 ) that contained such sites , with base changes highlighted in red ( Table 5 ) . The PCR primers used for site-directed mutagenesis are shown in Table 6 . For Enh5 , site 1 refers to the 5\u2032 Pitx2 , while site 2 is the 3\u2032 Pitx2-binding site ( see Figure 5 ) . Site-directed mutagenesis was performed as described ( Liu and Naismith , 2008 ) . Briefly , 100 ng of template Enhancer DNA was PCR amplified with 2 \u00b5M of each mutant primer pair , 200 \u00b5M dNTPs , 2 \u00b5l Phusion high-fidelity polymerase , and 5 \u00b5l 10X buffer in a total volume of 50 \u00b5l . The PCR programme was as follows: 94\u00b0C 3 min , 94\u00b0C 1 min , 52\u00b0C 1 min , 68\u00b0C 8 , 12 , or 24 min ( 500 bp/min ) , final extension 68\u00b0C 1 hr , then 4\u00b0C . 1/25th of each reaction was run on an Agarose gel to verify amplification , after which the remainder of the reaction was digested with DpnI to remove the parent template for 1 hr at 37\u00b0C . Another 1/25th of the DpnI digest was transformed into DH5\u03b1 cells and clones selected and amplified in culture for DNA extraction and sequence verification of the introduced mutations . 10 . 7554/eLife . 03743 . 023Table 5 .

Micro ChIP experiments were performed with pools of 25 pieces of PMZ and their anterior counterparts ( AMZ ) from whole pre-streak stage X\u2013XI embryos . Chromatin was cross-linked , extracted and sonicated to obtain 200\u20131000 bp fragments . Immunoprecipitation was done with rabbit anti-H3K27ac ( Abcam , UK ) , mouse anti-PITX2 ( Abcam , ab55599 ) , antibodies and rabbit IgG ( Millipore , Merck Millipore UK ) and mouse IgG ( Millipore , Merck Millipore UK ) bound to magnetic Dynabeads ( Life Technologies , Carlsbad , California , USA ) .

{"lay_summary": "Fruit flies are attracted to the smell of rotting fruit , and use it to guide them to nearby food sources . However , this task is made more challenging by the fact that the distribution of scent or odor molecules in the air is constantly changing . Fruit flies therefore need to cope with , and exploit , this variation if they are to use odors as cues . Odor molecules bind to receptors on the surface of nerve cells called olfactory sensory neurons , and trigger nerve impulses that travel along these cells . The olfactory sensory neurons are connected to other cells called projection neurons that in turn relay information to the higher centers of the brain . While many studies have investigated how fruit flies can distinguish between different odors , less is known about how animals can use variation in the strength of an odor to guide them towards its source . Kim et al . have now addressed this question by devising a method for delivering precise quantities of odors in controlled patterns to fruit flies , and then measuring the responses of olfactory sensory neurons and projection neurons . These experiments revealed that olfactory sensory neurons\u2014which are found mainly in the flies' antennae\u2014responded most strongly whenever an odor changed rapidly in strength , and showed relatively little response to constant odors . An independent study by Schulze , Gomez-Marin et al . found that olfactory sensory neurons in fruit fly larvae also respond in a similar way . Kim et al . also found that the response of the projection neurons depended on both the rate of nerve impulses in the olfactory sensory neurons and on how quickly this rate was changing . But , unlike the olfactory sensory neurons , projection neurons showed their strongest responses immediately after an odor first appeared . Thus , in contrast to organisms such as bacteria and worms , which are highly sensitive to the local concentration gradients of odors , fruit flies instead appear to be more responsive to the sudden appearance of an odor in their environment . Kim et al . suggest that this difference may reflect the fact that for ground-based organisms , local gradients are generally reliable predictors of the location of an odor source . However , for flying insects , continually changing air currents mean that predictable local gradients are less common . Therefore , the ability to detect a hint of an odor before the wind changes is a more useful skill .", "article": "Temporal experience of odor gradients is important in spatial orientation of animals . The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster exhibits robust odor-guided behaviors in an odor gradient field . In order to investigate how early olfactory circuits process temporal variation of olfactory stimuli , we subjected flies to precisely defined odor concentration waveforms and examined spike patterns of olfactory sensory neurons ( OSNs ) and projection neurons ( PNs ) . We found a significant temporal transformation between OSN and PN spike patterns , manifested by the PN output strongly signaling the OSN spike rate and its rate of change . A simple two-dimensional model admitting the OSN spike rate and its rate of change as inputs closely predicted the PN output . When cascaded with the rate-of-change encoding by OSNs , PNs primarily signal the acceleration and the rate of change of dynamic odor stimuli to higher brain centers , thereby enabling animals to reliably respond to the onsets of odor concentrations . \n Odor distribution in nature is intermittent and dynamic ( Murlis et al . , 1992; Vickers et al . , 2001 ) , and animals have evolved the ability to detect and respond to temporal variation of odor stimuli ( David et al . , 1983; Thesen et al . , 1993; Vickers et al . , 2001; Porter et al . , 2007; Semmelhack and Wang , 2009; Kato et al . , 2014 ) . In one of the most sophisticated examples , Drosophila larvae with only a single functional olfactory sensory neuron ( OSN ) are capable of moving toward a droplet of an attractive odor by actively orienting themselves ( Louis et al . , 2008 ) . Similarly , adult fruit flies exhibit robust odor-guided behaviors such as turning upwind in flight upon contact with an attractive odor plume ( Budick and Dickinson , 2006 ) and staying within a specific odor zone ( Semmelhack and Wang , 2009 ) . In order to enable such odor-guided tasks , it is essential for any olfactory system to process time-varying features of olfactory stimuli and supply behaviorally relevant information to higher brain centers . Several recent studies have investigated how dynamic olfactory stimuli are processed in insect early olfactory systems ( systems consisting principally of OSNs and projection neurons [PNs] ) and observed significant temporal processing of odor signals ( Bhandawat et al . , 2007; Geffen et al . , 2009; Kim et al . , 2011; Nagel and Wilson , 2011; Martelli et al . , 2013 ) . Most of these studies employed a simple odor delivery system that generated step-pulse-like odor stimuli without directly monitoring the actual odor concentration levels . For a rigorous understanding of sensory processing , however , it is essential to precisely measure the input stimuli and systematically explore the input space , as has been successfully done in the field of vision and audition ( Wu et al . , 2006 ) . Moreover , natural odor plumes are encountered in various spatiotemporal patterns , and their dynamics and statistics can influence the neural encoding mechanism ( Brenner et al . , 2000; Vickers et al . , 2001 ) . In Drosophila , OSNs expressing the same receptors connect with PNs in one of roughly 50 spherical compartments , termed olfactory glomeruli , which constitute a deutocerebral neuropil called the antennal lobe . PNs subsequently relay olfactory information to higher brain centers such as the mushroom body and the lateral horn ( Stocker et al . , 1990 ) . Two recent studies independently reported that Drosophila OSNs encode not only the odor concentration but also its rate of change as a function of time ( Kim et al . , 2011; Nagel and Wilson , 2011 ) . Building on this recent advance , we asked how PNs further contribute to creating internal representations of dynamic olfactory environments . We tested OSNs and PNs with short plume-like odor stimuli in a variety of settings and analyzed the correlation structure of input/output signals in the odor-OSN-PN pathway . We also constructed a two-dimensional ( 2D ) linear\u2013nonlinear ( LN ) model of the OSN-to-PN transformation by inducing an ensemble of triangle-shaped OSN spike rates via a systematic design of olfactory stimuli . \n We employed a novel odor delivery system that can reliably produce various odor concentration waveforms and provide measurements of the odor concentration with a millisecond resolution on every experiment trial ( Figure 1A , B ) ( Kim et al . , 2011 ) . Various odor concentration profiles were designed and tested ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1 ) , and the corresponding OSN and PN responses were measured in two separate assays sharing the same odor delivery system ( Figure 1A , B ) . The observed odor concentrations were closely matched between the two assays ( Figure 2A\u2013C ) . We used acetone as the primary odorant because its low ionization potential afforded a high signal-to-noise ratio in our odor concentration measurements . We tested a pair of directly connected OSNs and PNs innervating the DM4 glomerulus with five different acetone concentration waveforms . The dynamics of OSN and PN responses differed significantly from their respective feedforward inputs , and all responses initiated within a few tens of milliseconds of the odor onset ( Figure 1C ) . PNs generally showed a bigger peak spike rate and exhibited more phasic spiking patterns than the presynaptic OSNs . However , the exact functional transformation between OSNs and PNs could not be readily assessed due to the complex dynamics of OSN and PN signals . 10 . 7554/eLife . 06651 . 003Figure 1 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 06651 . 006 We therefore designed a set of elementary odor concentration waveforms: a step , a ramp and a parabola ( top row of Figure 2A\u2013C ) . We reasoned that the simple nature of these waveforms would facilitate the analysis of the input/output relationship . Consistent with previous reports ( Kim et al . , 2011; Nagel and Wilson , 2011 ) , OSNs responded most strongly to polynomial waveforms when the odor concentration rose rapidly . For the ramp and parabola odor signals , OSN responses were the exact rate-of-change function of their input: a step output to a ramp input ( Figure 2B , E ) and a ramp output to a parabola input ( Figure 2C , F ) . This pattern of encoding was preserved for different combinations of odorants and OSN-PN pairs ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . To look into this observation formally , we measured the similarity between three different input features\u2014concentration amplitude , rate of change , and acceleration\u2014and the output spike rate of OSNs by performing a set of cross-correlation analyses . The correlation was strong between the OSN output and both odor concentration and its rate of change , but weak between the OSN output and the acceleration of odor concentration ( Figure 2J ) . Given the very same panel of olfactory stimuli , PN responses exhibited bigger peak amplitude and more stereotyped temporal patterns than OSNs ( Figure 2G\u2013I ) . All PN responses transiently peaked at the time of the odor onset , and their peak times were on average advanced from the OSN peak times . Specifically , in response to ramp-shaped OSN signals , PNs exhibited a rapid step response ( Figure 2F , I ) . To step-like OSN signals , PN showed a phasic onset response , followed by a tonic spiking pattern ( Figure 2E , H ) . These input/output relationships are reminiscent of the rate-of-change encoding in the odor-to-OSN transformation , where the ramp and step odor signals were similarly transformed . Biophysically , this phenomenon suggests a rapid adaptation between OSNs and PNs , which is in agreement with previous reports demonstrating strong short-term depression in synapses between OSNs and PNs ( Kazama and Wilson , 2008 , 2009; Nagel et al . , 2015 ) . From a modeling perspective , this observation predicted a strong correlation between the PN spike rate and the rate of change of the OSN spike rate . A correlation analysis between the PN output and three different input features\u2014OSN spike rate , rate of change , and acceleration\u2014confirmed this prediction ( Figure 2K ) . Together , this supports the hypothesis that PN responses can be modeled as a function of the OSN spike rate and its rate of change , at least for the tested class of odor stimuli . We therefore propose a simple model of the OSN-to-PN transformation comprising two input blocks: the OSN spike rate and its rate of change , followed by a 2D nonlinearity that maps these inputs into the PN spike rate ( Figure 3D ) . The model has the structure of a classical 2D LN model with its linear blocks postulated as amplitude and rate-of-change filters ( Brenner et al . , 2000; Geffen et al . , 2009 ) . Given the hypothesized input blocks , the model can be fully identified by estimating the nonlinear block from experimental data . The validity of the model can be tested by assessing its ability to predict the PN response to new odor waveforms . In order to estimate the nonlinearity , we first designed OSN spike activity profiles that explore the hypothesized PN input space with an efficient sampling grid . An ensemble of triangle-shaped inputs was shown to be suitable for this purpose , since each up/down ramp stimulus tests the target system with a distinct pair of positive and negative gradients while also sweeping a wide range of input amplitudes ( Kim et al . , 2011 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 06651 . 007Figure 3 . A simple two-dimensional ( 2D ) model characterizes the OSN-to-PN transformation . ( A ) Input/output traces used in modeling the OSN-to-PN transformation ( n = 5 trials for both OSN and PN data ) . An ensemble of triangle-shaped OSN spike rates ( middle ) were designed as a direct in vivo input to the PNs . These OSN spiking patterns were induced by an ensemble of parabola odor inputs ( top ) . ( B ) Input and output samples for the 2D nonlinearity block . Input axes are OSN spike rate and its rate of change , and the output is the PN spike rate .

Six OSN spike rates\u2014five triangle-shaped signals and one step-pulse-shaped input\u2014and their rate-of-change functions were projected to the surface . Amplitude readouts from the trajectories on the surface constitute the simulated PN output . The step-pulse-shaped input was introduced for cross-validation of the model since this input was not used for building the model . ( F ) The predicted PN spike rate closely followed the magnitude and dynamics of the experimental PN spike rate , for six OSN spike rate inputs ( insets ) . The average prediction errors are 31 , 26 , 21 , 21 , 23 , 29 spike/s ( clockwise from the top-left corner , in root-mean-square error ) .

( A ) The triangle-shaped OSN spike rate ( top ) , its rate of change ( middle ) , and the corresponding PN spike rates ( bottom ) . At a fixed OSN spike rate ( 60 spike/s , a solid red line in the top panel ) , the PN spike rate varies from 0 to 280 spike/s depending on the rate-of-change value of the OSN spike rate . ( B ) At a fixed OSN spike rate ( blue line for 30 spike/s , red line for 60 spike/s , green line for 120 spike/s , as depicted in ( A ) ) , the PN spike rate is linearly related to the rate-of-change value of the OSN spike rate with half-wave rectification in the negative rate-of-change interval . ( C ) The gain \u03b2 of the PN response , with respect to the rate of change of the OSN output , decreases with increasing input amplitude . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 06651 . 008 How can we induce an ensemble of triangle signals at the OSN output ? We fine-tuned odor concentration signals , while observing the OSN spike rate , until the desired OSN spike rates were produced ( Figure 3A ) . The odor concentration signals inferred from this method are an ensemble of parabolas with systematically varying peak times and amplitudes ( Figure 3A ) . The 2D nonlinearity was estimated subsequently by running a ridge regression analysis on spike rate samples from the OSN and PN signals ( Kim et al . , 2011 ) ( Figure 3B , C ) . The estimated 2D nonlinearity showed a strong dependency on the rate-of-change of OSN spike rate ( Figure 3B , C ) . When the nonlinearity was estimated for samples with a fixed odor concentration value , the PN spike rate rose almost linearly with respect to the rate of change ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . However , the gain of the PN output with respect to the OSN rate of change decreased monotonically with concentration , suggesting that at least a 2D model is required to describe the OSN-to-PN transformation ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . We tested the model by comparing the simulated model output with the experimental PN spike activity ( Figure 3C ) . With step , ramp , and parabola odor inputs , the experimental outputs were closely matched by the model ( root-mean-square error = 25 spike/s , Figure 3F ) . While the odor-evoked responses were well matched by the model , including peak times and amplitudes , the model output often overestimated the actual PN spike rate before and after the stimulus interval . This is because the estimated nonlinearity exhibits a relatively high slope at low input amplitudes ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1 ) , which renders the system highly sensitive to the noisy fluctuations at low OSN spike rates ( Pahlberg and Sampath , 2011 ) . This problem is thought to be mitigated in olfactory glomeruli by pooling input from a population of OSNs , thereby achieving a higher signal-to-noise ratio than provided by a single OSN ( Bhandawat et al . , 2007 ) . In summary , the proposed simple 2D model provides a decent approximation of the OSN-to-PN transformation and corroborates the notion that PNs mainly encode OSN spike rate and its rate of change in a nonlinear fashion . What is the functional consequence of acceleration encoding by antennal lobe PNs ? In signal processing theory , the time derivative , or rate-of-change operation , advances the phase of a time signal . For example , cos ( t ) is the time derivative of sin ( t ) , and its phase is advanced by \u03c0/2 . Similarly , the rate of change of a sample triangle-shaped signal shows an advancement of a peak time , and its acceleration exhibits a peak time that is further advanced ( Figure 4A ) . Therefore , we reasoned that the computation of the first and second time derivatives ( rate of change and acceleration ) of odor concentrations by OSN and PNs , respectively , acts to advance peak times of olfactory stimuli . To investigate this idea with a larger set of odor stimuli , we designed a set of triangle-shaped odor waveforms with peak times varying uniformly between 0 . 6 s and 1 . 7 s after the stimulus onset ( Figure 4B , \u2018odor\u2019 curve in Figure 4C ) . As shown in the previous experiments with triangle-shaped stimuli ( Figure 2B ) , OSNs responded in a pulse-shaped pattern ( Figure 4B ) , with the peak response advanced by 400\u20131000 ms relative to the stimulus peak ( \u2018OSN\u2019 curve in Figure 4C ) . In response to the same panel of odor stimuli , PNs consistently produced peak output ( Figure 4B ) at around 200 ms after the stimulus onset , regardless of the dynamics of the odor/OSN signals ( \u2018PN\u2019 curve in Figure 4C ) . For the parabola-shaped odor stimuli ( Figure 3A ) , the peak OSN and PN responses were similarly advanced in time relative to the odor and OSN peaks ( right plot in Figure 4C ) but were more variable . The advancement of a peak time was previously reported for step-pulse odor stimuli ( Bhandawat et al . , 2007 ) , and our work confirms this result for a larger set of dynamically varying odor stimuli . Together , we hypothesize that acceleration encoding in the Drosophila antennal lobe allows higher olfactory centers to rapidly respond to onsets of slowly rising odor stimuli . 10 . 7554/eLife . 06651 . 009Figure 4 . A cascade of rate-of-change encodings leads to a rapid detection of the stimulus onset . ( A ) A cascade of two rate-of-change transformations leads to the advancement of the peak time near to the stimulus onset , in response to a triangle-shaped input .

Results with error bars indicate mean \u00b1 standard deviation . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 06651 . 009 \n We tested first- and second-order neurons in the Drosophila olfactory system with a wide range of dynamically varying odor concentrations and constructed a simple 2D LN model for the temporal processing of olfactory information . The shape of the 2D nonlinearity and the relatively low prediction error of the model support the hypothesis that the PN spike rate is most strongly dependent on the rate of change of its feedforward OSN input . When combined with the dynamic sensory encoding by OSNs\u2014encoding of odor concentration and its rate of change\u2014PNs signal the rate of change and , most strongly , the acceleration of odor concentration signals to higher brain centers . One remarkable example of the \u2018acceleration encoding\u2019 by PNs is found in the OSN/PN responses to the parabolically rising odor input , where the onset is enormously amplified to create step-like responses in PNs ( Figure 2C , I ) . To the best of our knowledge , the encoding of acceleration by an olfactory sensory system has not been demonstrated elsewhere . This sensory encoding mechanism is distinguished from other chemosensory systems . For example , in bacterial chemotaxis , the rate of change of a stimulus is computed and fed directly into its motor system that controls the flagellar rotation ( Bourret et al . , 1991 ) . The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans also exhibits a local-gradient-based chemotaxis behavior , and neurons in its sensorimotor pathway are shown to compute the rate of change of concentration gradients ( Suzuki et al . , 2008 ) . Why do fruit flies compute acceleration of odor concentrations ? How is the acceleration of an olfactory stimulus relevant to a fly's chemotaxis ? An efficient chemotaxis strategy should depend on the distribution of odor molecules in the behaviorally relevant range , which can be quantified using a Reynolds number ( Weissburg , 2000 ) . Habitats of both nematodes and bacteria have low Reynolds numbers ( Re < 1 ) , and thus the odor distribution is primarily determined by a diffusion process . In this environment , the steepest local odor gradient can be directly linked to the location of the odor source , and therefore animals in such environments are expected to encode the rate of change of odor concentrations in order to detect the steepest gradient . In contrast , flying insects experience fluid mechanics that have relatively high Reynolds numbers ( Re > 10 ) , with turbulence dictating the distribution of odor molecules over the diffusion process . In this regime , the local odor gradient within an odor plume would be less informative in determining the location of the odor source than the distribution of odor plumes over a macroscopic scale . In fact , it has been well established that insects , including fruit flies , use a strategy of turning upwind during odor plume encounters , a strategy that does not require interpreting local concentration gradients ( Budick and Dickinson , 2006 ) . Furthermore , the relative position of a flying animal and the distribution of odor plumes evolve rapidly over time . It is therefore crucial for flying insects to detect and respond to an encountered odor plume before the fly's position drifts relative to adjacent plumes . We showed that Drosophila's early olfactory system signals the acceleration of odor concentrations to higher brain centers . This encoding mechanism allows an animal to detect the odor onset at a very early phase ( Figure 4 ) . Therefore , it is tempting to speculate that the acceleration encoding has evolved in Drosophila to maximize its chance to locate the odor source in a turbulent environment . It has also been shown that fruit flies can respond to the spatial difference of the odor concentration between two antennae in both walking and flight ( Duistermars et al . , 2009; Gaudry et al . , 2013 ) . However , even with the lack of spatial sampling ability , fruit fly larvae can locate an odor source , based on the temporal sampling of odor gradients ( Louis et al . , 2008 ) . Therefore , adult fruit flies may rely on both spatial and temporal sampling methods to locate an odor source , although their relative importance may vary depending on the locomotive state , as Reynolds numbers are different between walking and flight . \n We built a precise and versatile odor delivery system ( Kim et al . , 2011 ) . An odorant was diluted in dipropylene glycol , and 20 ml of the resulting mixture was put into a glass vial ( 30 ml ) and subsequently sealed by a screw cap with a silicone septa . Inlet and outlet needles were inserted into the vial headspace . The saturated vapor in this headspace was puffed by directing a low-flow air stream ( \u2264100 ml/min ) from an air cylinder ( UN1002; TechAir , White Plains , NY ) into the odor vial by opening inlet and outlet solenoid valves ( Series 10; Parker-Hannifin Corporation , Cleveland , OH ) . Subsequently , the outlet needle carried the saturated vapor from inside the vial to a custom laminar mixer where the odor flow was combined with a strong carrier flow ( 800 ml/min ) . The mixer was carefully designed so as to minimize the turbulence that could be formed when the low-flow odor stream is added to a high-flow-rate carrier stream . The output of the mixer was then directed to the antennae and maxillary palps of a prepared animal through a glass capillary ( 1 mm inner diameter ) . The interval between two consecutive puffs was between 45 s and 70 s depending on the amount of vapor consumed in each puff , and the mixture was replenished about every 10 trials . All flows were electronically controlled by a miniature pressure controller ( VSO-EP; Parker-Hannifin , OH ) and measured using a digital flow meter ( PV9000; Key Instruments , Trevose , PA ) in real time . After hitting the animal , the odor flow was immediately sucked into a probe and measured by a photoionization detector ( PID; Aurora Scientific , Canada ) with 1 l/min flow rate . The output of the PID was digitally sampled at 10 kHz and later advanced by 2 ms in order to compensate for the latency caused by the suction probe . In order to convert the PID output voltage into the odor concentration in parts per million ( ppm ) , we regularly ( every 10 trials ) measured the output of the PID with a calibration odor ( 3% propylene ) and estimated the general sensitivity of the PID , which gradually decays over time . The PID sensitivity ratio of actual odor to standard odor was measured in a separate experiment with a fully saturated odor vapor and used to calculate a scaling factor between the PID output ( in Volts ) and the absolute odor concentration ( in ppm ) ( Kim et al . , 2011 ) . Drosophila stocks were maintained at room temperature on a 12-hr light/12-hr dark schedule and kept in standard plastic vials containing a cornmeal agar medium . All experiments were carried out with female flies of the NP3062-GAL4/NP3062-GAL4;UAS-mCD8::GFP/UAS-mCD8::GFP;+/+ genotype . NP3062-GAL flies were kindly provided by Kei Ito . Female flies 2\u20135 days posteclosion were used for both OSN and PN recordings . For the OSN recordings , single basiconic sensilla were targeted with electrolytically sharpened tungsten electrodes to measure the aggregate electrical activity of OSNs housed in these sensilla ( Figure 1B ) ( Kim et al . , 2011 ) . Recordings were analyzed by a custom MATLAB code ( Source code 1 ) to sort out action potentials from Or59b or Or7a OSNs ( Kim et al . , 2011 ) . For the PN recordings , a female fly was gently immobilized beneath a cellulose acetate film with an adhesive ( Datta et al . , 2008 ) . The film was then carefully transferred to a petri dish in which a circular hole was made at the center . When placing an animal in the hole , the location of the head was carefully adjusted so that the antennae and maxillary pals were located strictly within the odor stream between the odor delivery tubing and the suction probe , both of which were embedded in the petri dish . Antennal lobes were exposed by gently removing a head cuticle as well as the film under saline solution containing 108 mM NaCl , 5 mM KCl , 2 mM CaCl2 , 8 . 2 mM MgCl2 , 4 mM NaHCO3 , 1 mM NaH2PO4 , 5 mM trehalose , 10 mM sucrose , and 5 mM HEPES ( pH , 7 . 5; 265 mOsm ) ( Wang et al . , 2003 ) . In order to access the PN somas , the perineural sheath was weakened by a 1\u20132 min treatment with 1 mg/ml collagenase ( Type I Collagenase; Sigma\u2013Aldrich , St . Louis , MO ) . The dorsal part of the sheath was then gently ruptured by a sharp quartz glass electrode using a micromanipulator ( MP-285; Sutter Instrument , Novato , CA ) . A ground electrode was placed into the saline solution and connected to a headstage amplifier ( CV-7B; Molecular Devices , Sunnyvale , CA ) . In order to record action potentials of a single PN , a borosilicate patch electrode ( 7\u201310 M\u03a9 tip resistance ) filled with saline solution was attached to the target cell and gentle suction was applied through the electrode capillary until a loose seal ( 50\u2013100 M\u03a9 ) was formed . The current was amplified ( MultiClamp 700B; Molecular Devices , CA ) , low-pass filtered at 1 . 2 kHz , sampled at 10 kHz ( Digidata 1322A; Axon Instruments ) , and stored on a computer by software ( Clampex; Molecular Devices , CA ) . The animal was alive and active for a few hours as indicated by the spontaneous extension of its legs . Fresh oxygenated saline solution was perfused throughout the experiment . Finally , the PNs innervating the DM4 and DL5 glomeruli were identified by genetic means , using an enhancer trap line expressing Green Fluorescent Protein ( GFP ) in these cells . The identity of recorded cells was further verified by their odor response and the location of the soma in the dorsal cluster of the antennal lobe . Spike sequences were detected and sorted offline using custom software ( Source code 1 ) , written in MATLAB ( MathWorks , Natick , MA ) . Spike rates of OSNs and PNs were estimated by constructing a peristimulus\u2013time histogram ( PSTH ) with a 100-ms bin size and a 75-ms overlap between adjacent bins . For the correlation analysis and 2D model prediction , the rate of change and acceleration components of odor and OSN traces were estimated by a forward difference equation , with the difference time interval as the scaling factor; for example , dxdt=[x ( t\u2212\u0394 ) \u2212x ( t ) ]/\u0394 , where x represents either the odor concentration or the OSN response , and \u0394 denotes the time interval . The time interval was 50 ms for the odor rate of change , 100 ms for odor acceleration , the OSN rate of change and OSN acceleration . Since the output of the forward difference equation is sensitive to high-frequency components of the signal , we low-pass filtered the amplitude and rate-of-change signals before deriving the rate of change and acceleration , respectively . Cut-off frequencies of the low-pass filters were 20 Hz for the odor amplitude , 10 Hz for the odor rate of change , 4 Hz for the OSN spike rate , and 4 Hz for the OSN rate of change . The cross-correlation coefficient , \u03f1 ( x , y ) between an input x and the corresponding output y was computed as a normalized cross-covariance function; that is , \u03f1 ( x , y ) =1N\u2211i=1N ( x[i]\u2212\u03bcx ) ( y[i]\u2212\u03bcy ) \u03c3x\u03c3y , where \u03bc and \u03c3 are , respectively , the mean and standard deviation of the variable in the subscript . We hypothesized a nonlinear function f ( . , . ) that takes inputs from the OSN spike rate y and its rate of change dy/dt and whose output corresponds to the PN spike rate z; for example , z=f ( y , dydt ) , and f ( . , . ) was estimated using a 2D ridge regression method on 100 \u00d7 100 grids ( Kim et al . , 2011 ) .", "headings": ["Abstract", "Introduction", "Results", "Discussion", "Materials and methods"], "keywords": ["short report", "neuroscience"], "id": "elife-06651-v2"}
{"lay_summary": "The seeds of rice , wheat and other flowering plants store a variety of nutrients , largely in the form of sugars , proteins and oils . These stored reserves provide the main source of calories for humans and livestock all over the world , so they are of major social and economic importance . Seed development is an intricate process . It begins after male sperm cells fuse with female gametes inside the flower . This leads to the formation of the embryo , which will develop into a new plant , and a structure called the endosperm , which nourishes the growing embryo . A protective seed coat surrounds the embryo and endosperm , which develops from certain parts of the parent flower . In order for the seed to develop successfully , these three components have to communicate so they can coordinate their growth . Auxin is a key plant hormone that is needed for plants to grow and develop properly and is necessary for the endosperm to form . Previous research has shown that the endosperm is also required to trigger the formation of the seed coat , but the signal that triggers this process has not yet been identified . Figueiredo et al . now address this question in a small flowering plant called Arabidopsis thaliana . The experiments show that the endosperm produces auxin , which acts as a molecular signal for the seed coat to start forming . Exposing unfertilized flowers to auxin caused a seed coat to form even though the endosperm was absent . This suggests that this hormone alone is sufficient to trigger the formation of the seed coat without any other signals . Further analysis revealed that a protein called AGL62 regulates the movement of auxin to the parts of the flower that give rise to the seed coat . In the absence of AGL62 , the hormone remains trapped in the endosperm and the seed coat fails to develop . The next step following on from this work is to understand how auxin moves from the endosperm to the parts of the flower that form the seed coat .", "article": "In flowering plants , seed development is initiated by the fusion of the maternal egg and central cells with two paternal sperm cells , leading to the formation of embryo and endosperm , respectively . The fertilization products are surrounded by the maternally derived seed coat , whose development prior to fertilization is blocked by epigenetic regulators belonging to the Polycomb Group ( PcG ) protein family . Here we show that fertilization of the central cell results in the production of auxin and most likely its export to the maternal tissues , which drives seed coat development by removing PcG function . We furthermore show that mutants for the MADS-box transcription factor AGL62 have an impaired transport of auxin from the endosperm to the integuments , which results in seed abortion . We propose that AGL62 regulates auxin transport from the endosperm to the integuments , leading to the removal of the PcG block on seed coat development . \n In flowering plants , fertilization of the two female gametes , egg cell and central cell by the two male sperm cells results in the development of the embryo and the endosperm , a nourishing tissue which supports embryo growth . These two fertilization products are surrounded by the seed coat , a sporophytic tissue of purely maternal origin . While the embryo is the only component of the seed that will form the next generation , it contributes little to seed growth . Instead , the interplay between the\u00a0endosperm and seed coat determines the final size of the seed . Impaired endosperm proliferation has a negative effect on seed coat development , as is the case in the Arabidopsis haiku or miniseed mutants ( Garcia et al . , 2003; Luo et al . , 2005 ) or in transgenic lines expressing diphtheria toxin A in the endosperm ( Weijers et al . , 2003 ) . And , conversely , mutations that affect seed coat expansion limit endosperm growth , such as transparent testa glabra 2 ( Garcia et al . , 2005 ) , while mutants with increased integument cell proliferation like megaintegumenta/auxin responsive factor 2 , result in enlarged seeds with more abundant endosperm ( Schruff et al . , 2006 ) . Furthermore , the absence of the endothelium integument layer results in seed abortion , highlighting the importance of the developing seed coat for the establishment of a viable seed ( Mizzotti et al . , 2012 ) . Endosperm initiation in Arabidopsis is coupled to the production of auxin in the central cell following fertilization ( Figueiredo et al . , 2015 ) ; however , the factor initiating seed coat development is yet to be described . Seed coat initiation is dependent on the fertilization of the female gametophyte , but mutants for sporophytically-acting Polycomb Group ( PcG ) proteins develop a seed coat without fertilization in a dosage-sensitive manner ( Roszak and K\u00f6hler , 2011 ) . PcG proteins assemble into multimeric complexes , of which the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 ( PRC2 ) represses target loci through the deposition of trimethyl groups on lysine 27 of histone H3 ( H3K27me3 ) ( Mozgova et al . , 2015 ) . Therefore , the initiation of seed coat development prior to fertilization is inhibited by sporophytically active PRC2 complexes and this block is relieved following fertilization through a signal derived from the fertilization products ( Figueiredo and K\u00f6hler , 2014; Mozgova et al . , 2015 ) . Seed coat development is dependent on the development of the sexual endosperm ( Weijers et al . , 2003; Ingouff et al . , 2006; Roszak and K\u00f6hler , 2011 ) , strongly suggesting that the seed coat-initiation signal is generated in the fertilized central cell/endosperm . Here , we show that seed coat development requires production of auxin in the fertilized central cell/endosperm and most likely the transport of auxin to the ovule integuments in an AGL62-dependent manner . We demonstrate that application of auxin is sufficient to drive seed coat development and that AGL62 regulates the expression of P-GLYCOPROTEIN 10 ( PGP10 ) , in the endosperm , which likely functions as an auxin transporter to the sporophytic tissues . Finally , we show that auxin is sufficient to remove the PRC2 block on seed coat development . \n Seed coat initiation is dependent on the fertilization of the central cell by one of the paternally-contributed sperm cells , but this requirement can be bypassed in mutants of sporophytic PRC2 components that initiate the\u00a0autonomous development of the seed coat ( Roszak and K\u00f6hler , 2011 ) . In order to identify the signaling pathways that could be involved in seed coat initiation , we generated transcriptome data from non-fertilized wild-type ( WT ) ovules and vrn2/- emf2/+ ovules at four days after emasculation ( 4 DAE ) , and WT seeds at two days after pollination ( 2 DAP ) . In contrast to WT ovules , non-fertilized vrn2/- emf2/+ ovules initiate autonomous seed coat development ( Roszak and K\u00f6hler , 2011 ) , correlating with the activation of genes involved in auxin and gibberellin ( GA ) response or signaling that became also activated in fertilized seeds ( Table 1 and Table 1\u2014source data 1 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 20542 . 003Table 1 .

In order to test whether this activation was specific to the seed coat we investigated the behavior of auxin and GA reporter lines before and after fertilization ( Figure 1 ) . To monitor auxin signaling , we investigated expression of the DR5v2::VENUS reporter ( Liao et al . , 2015 ) before and after fertilization . There was no DR5v2::VENUS reporter activity in unfertilized ovules ( Figure 1A ) , with the exception of a few cells neighboring the vascular bundle and occasionally near the antipodal cells . However , shortly after fertilization VENUS activity was detectable in the sporophytic tissues , where it persisted throughout seed development , with particular incidence in the funiculus and the micropylar region ( Figure 1B\u2013C ) . We further substantiated these observations with the use of the R2D2 auxin sensor system ( Liao et al . , 2015 ) . Before fertilization there was a strong DII:VENUS expression in the integuments , indicating very low or absent auxin signaling ( Figure 1D ) . However , this signal was quickly depleted following fertilization , as early as the first division of the central cell ( Figure 1E ) . Conversely , the auxin-insensitive mDII:Tdtomato remained stable in the seed coat , indicating a stable expression of the RPS5a promoter , that drives both reporter genes . These observations indicate a rapid accumulation of auxin in the sporophytic tissues following fertilization of the maternal gametes . 10 . 7554/eLife . 20542 . 005Figure 1 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 20542 . 007 We further analyzed plants expressing the DELLA reporter RGA::GFP:RGA , as a marker for active GA signaling ( Dorcey et al . , 2009 ) . Before fertilization we observed a strong GFP signal in the integuments which quickly diminished after fertilization ( Figure 1F\u2013G ) , indicating an activation of GA signaling , similarly to what we observed with the auxin reporters . To test whether auxin and GA act in the same pathway during seed coat development , we treated unpollinated pistils of plants expressing the RGA reporter with the synthetic auxin 2 , 4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid ( 2 , 4-D ) and observed a removal of the RGA protein , similarly to what happens after fertilization or application of gibberellic acid ( GA3; Figure 1H and Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . Conversely , the\u00a0application of GA3 did not have an influence on the expression of the auxin reporters DR5v2 or R2D2 ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . These observations reveal that auxin acts upstream of GA during seed coat development . Seed coat growth initiating after fertilization is a process driven by cell elongation rather than cell division , since the\u00a0integument cell number did not change after fertilization ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . Given that both auxin and gibberellin signaling is active in the developing seed coat , and that both hormones are known for having a role in cell growth and expansion ( Rayle and Cleland , 1992; Cowling and Harberd , 1999 ) , we tested whether exogenous application of either auxin or GA3 was sufficient to drive seed coat development . We treated unpollinated pistils with either GA3 or 2 , 4-D and investigated autonomous seed coat development after three days ( Figure 2A\u2013B ) . We used vanillin staining as a marker for the\u00a0seed coat development , which stains the proanthocyanidins produced in the endothelium after fertilization ( Debeaujon et al . , 2000 ) . Mock-treated ovules were either not or only weakly stained with vanillin , while treatments with GA3 or 2 , 4-D resulted in 30% to 40% of ovules showing strong or very strong staining . Furthermore , the ovules treated with either GA3 or 2 , 4-D were significantly larger than the mock-treated ones ( Figure 2C ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 20542 . 008Figure 2 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 20542 . 009 We further tested whether over-production of either one of these hormones specifically in the integuments of unfertilized ovules would trigger seed coat development . We raised transgenic plants expressing a GA biosynthesis gene ( GA3ox1 ) under the control of the BANYULS ( BAN ) promoter , which is active in the innermost integument/seed coat layer ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1 ) ( Debeaujon et al . , 2003 ) . We emasculated BAN::GA3ox1 transgenic plants and performed vanillin staining at 5 DAE to test for initiation of seed coat development . As with the GA3 treatments , we observed an increased number of ovules stained in the transgenic lines when compared to WT plants ( Figure 2D\u2013F ) . In order to test whether increased auxin production in the integuments triggers autonomous seed coat development , we analyzed the gain-of-function yuc6-2D mutant , in which the auxin biosynthesis gene YUCCA6 ( YUC6 ) is ectopically expressed due to the insertion of a Cauliflower Mosaic Virus 35S ( CaMV35S ) enhancer sequence in its promotor region ( Kim et al . , 2007 ) . Activation of the YUC6 gene in yuc6-2D is expected to be restricted to sporophytic tissues , as the CaMV35S enhancer is not active in the female gametophyte ( Roszak and K\u00f6hler , 2011 ) . We therefore tested whether increased auxin production in the integuments of yuc6-2D plants resulted in the\u00a0autonomous development of the seed coat , as scored by vanillin staining . Indeed , up to 50% of yuc6-2D ovules stained with vanillin , while less than 5% of WT ovules were stained ( Figure 2D ) . These observations reveal that both auxin and GA3 are sufficient to trigger seed coat development without fertilization . Based on our findings that ectopic auxin and GA3 are sufficient to trigger the\u00a0seed coat development and that auxin acts upstream of GA , we hypothesized that auxin may be the post-fertilization signal that triggers seed coat development . This hypothesis is in agreement with our previous observations that auxin is produced in the endosperm after fertilization ( Figueiredo et al . , 2015 ) . In order to test whether auxin produced in the endosperm is necessary for seed coat development , we analyzed mutants deficient either in auxin signaling ( axr1/+ axl-1/- ) or auxin biosynthesis ( wei8/- tar1/- tar2-1/+ and wei8/- tar1/- tar2-2/+ ) . The homozygous axr1/- axl-1/- mutant is zygotic lethal , thus 25% of seeds from an axr1/+ axl-1/- plant will abort ( Dharmasiri et al . , 2007 ) . Nevertheless , those seeds did not differ in size compared to WT seeds at 3 DAP and were only slightly smaller compared to their WT counterparts at 5 DAP , indicating that seed coat development is not impaired ( Figure 3A and Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . We thus conclude that auxin signaling in the fertilization products ( endosperm and embryo ) is not necessary to initiate seed coat development . In contrast , wei/tar mutants affected in auxin biosynthesis showed seeds aborting at different sizes ( Figure 3B and Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . Namely , around 2 . 5% of seeds completely failed to develop a seed coat and another 20\u201330% of seeds did not reach full WT size ( Figure 3C\u2013E ) . No differences were observed in the integument cell number between the mutant and WT ovules ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2 ) , indicating that cell expansion following fertilization is affected in the wei/tar mutant . These observations strongly support the idea that post-fertilization production of auxin in the fertilization products is necessary for the early stages of seed coat development in Arabidopsis , but that auxin signalling does not seem to be required for full seed expansion until later developmental stages . 10 . 7554/eLife . 20542 . 010Figure 3 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 20542 . 011 Previous work had revealed that the endosperm , rather than the embryo , is solely responsible for triggering the\u00a0seed coat development in Arabidopsis ( Weijers et al . , 2003; Ingouff et al . , 2006; Roszak and K\u00f6hler , 2011 ) . Thus , our data showing that auxin biosynthesis after fertilization is necessary for seed coat development , strongly supports our hypothesis that auxin needs to be produced in the endosperm to initiate seed coat development . Additionally , we previously showed that seeds mutant for axr1 axl-1 have endosperm proliferation defects ( Figueiredo et al . , 2015 ) . Our observations reported here that these seeds develop a seed coat similar to that of WT seeds indicates that the proliferation of the endosperm per se is not required for seed coat initiation . This is in line with previous observations that mutants with severe endosperm proliferation defects , such as the titan mutants , still develop a seed coat ( Liu and Meinke , 1998 ) . To test whether production of auxin in the central cell is sufficient to trigger seed coat development , we expressed the auxin biosynthesis genes TAA1 and YUC6 under control of the central cell and early endosperm specific promoter DD65 ( Steffen et al . , 2007; Figueiredo et al . , 2015 ) and investigated the\u00a0autonomous seed coat development at 5 DAE . Indeed , DD65::TAA1; DD65::YUC6 expressing ovules initiated seed coat development , as evidenced by a significant increase in size ( Figure 4A\u2013B ) and the production of protoanthocyanidins ( Figure 4C\u2013D ) . The\u00a0integument cell number was not affected in the transgenic lines ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . The increased ovule size in DD65::TAA1; DD65::YUC6 expressing lines correlated with an increased auxin signaling in sporophytic tissues , revealed by the activation of DR5v2 in the integuments as well as the removal of the DII:VENUS signal in R2D2 expressing lines ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . Ovules expressing DD65::TAA1; DD65::YUC6 initiate central cell division in the absence of fertilization ( Figueiredo et al . , 2015 ) . However , the\u00a0autonomous central cell division in these ovules only occurs at 6 DAE , while at 5 DAE seed coat development did clearly initiate . This data reveal that seed coat development precedes replication of the central cell , further indicating that endosperm development per se is not required for the initiation of seed coat development . 10 . 7554/eLife . 20542 . 012Figure 4 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 20542 . 013 Our observations demonstrate that ectopic production of auxin in the central cell is sufficient to drive seed coat development without fertilization . Additionally , the transgenic lines showed pronounced parthenocarpic growth of the gynoecium ( Figure 4E ) , supporting the hypothesis that endosperm-produced auxin likely acts as a signal to the maternal tissues , inducing fruit development ( Dorcey et al . , 2009 ) . Our data strongly suggest that production of auxin in the developing endosperm is likely to be the trigger for seed coat development . To further challenge this hypothesis , we investigated plants mutant for the MADS-box transcription factor AGL62 . agl62 seeds abort early after fertilization ( around 3\u20134 DAP ) , correlating with early endosperm cellularization ( Kang et al . , 2008 ) and failure to develop a seed coat ( Roszak and K\u00f6hler , 2011 ) . The agl62 mutant did not show defects in integument cell number , implying compromised cell expansion following fertilization ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . To test whether the early cellularization of agl62 was the cause for the defects in seed coat development , we crossed plants mutant for agl62/+ with a mutant for HALLIMASCH ( hal/+ ) , whose seeds fail to undergo endosperm cellularization ( Mayer et al . , 1999 ) . In agl62 seeds the endosperm cellularizes at around 3 DAP , but in double mutant agl62 hal seeds this early cellularization phenotype is reverted ( Figure 5A\u2013C ) . However , similarly to the single agl62 mutant , agl62 hal seeds do not develop a seed coat and remain small . We thus propose that early cellularization of agl62 endosperm is a consequence , rather than a cause of the failure to develop seed coat . Given that AGL62 is solely expressed in the endosperm ( Kang et al . , 2008; Roszak and K\u00f6hler , 2011 ) , we hypothesized whether this transcription factor could be involved in regulating the pathways driving seed coat development . Consistently , GA signaling was not activated in agl62 integuments , as evidenced by the maintained GFP signal of the RGA DELLA reporter ( RGA::GFP:RGA ) in agl62 seeds ( Figures 1G and 5D ) . Importantly , also auxin signaling was impaired in agl62 integuments , which failed to express the DR5::VENUS reporter . Strikingly however , while no VENUS signal was observed in agl62 integuments , we could clearly observe VENUS expression in the endosperm of agl62 seeds ( Figure 5E\u2013F ) , contrasting the absence of VENUS activity in WT seeds . These results strongly suggest that in WT seeds , auxin is produced in the endosperm after fertilization and quickly exported into the integuments . However , in the absence of AGL62 , auxin export is impaired and it accumulates in the endosperm at sufficiently high levels to activate DR5 expression . 10 . 7554/eLife . 20542 . 014Figure 5 . agl62 seeds fail to develop a seed coat .

Seed abortion was scored at 3 DAP , in three manually dissected siliques per line . The five lines shown here are representative of 25 total analyzed lines . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 20542 . 015 Our observation that auxin is trapped in the endosperm of agl62 seeds suggests that AGL62 regulates the expression or activity of auxin transporters in the endosperm . We therefore investigated the transcriptome of agl62 seeds at 30 hr after manual pollination and searched for genes encoding putative auxin transporters that were downregulated in this mutant compared to WT seeds . We found that PGP10 , a gene coding for an ABCB-type transporter was significantly downregulated in agl62 seeds ( log2FC\u00a0=\u00a0\u22123 . 27 , p-value=\u22122 . 83E-41; See also Table 1\u2014source data 1 ) . PGP-type transporters are active auxin transporters ( Geisler et al . , 2005; Lin and Wang , 2005 ) , raising the possibility that lack of PGP10 expression could account for the accumulation of auxin in the endosperm of agl62 seeds . In order to test whether PGP10 was expressed in the endosperm , we developed a PGP10::GFP reporter and investigated its expression in ovules and seeds of Arabidopsis . Consistently , PGP10 was expressed before fertilization in the central cell and its expression was maintained in the endosperm after fertilization ( Figure 5G\u2013H ) . The\u00a0expression of PGP10 required AGL62 function , as PGP10 expression was not detectable in agl62 seeds at 2 DAP ( Figure 5I ) , in agreement with the agl62 transcriptome data . Nevertheless , the\u00a0PGP10 expression in agl62 under control of the AGL62 promoter was not sufficient to induce seed coat development ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1 ) , suggesting that additional factors are required to activate PGP10 function , similarly as previously reported for other PGPs ( Bouchard et al . , 2006; Wu et al . , 2010; Wang et al . , 2013 ) . Previous observations revealed that sporophytic PRC2s exert a block on seed coat development that is lifted following fertilization ( Roszak and K\u00f6hler , 2011 ) . Lack of the core PRC2 subunits VRN2 and EMF2 results in a\u00a0dosage-dependent autonomous seed coat development , as visualized by staining of protoanthocyanidins using vanillin ( Figure 6A\u2013C ) . Thus , lack of PRC2 function and ectopic auxin are sufficient to initiate seed coat development in the absence of fertilization; we therefore asked whether auxin and PRC2 act in the same pathway initiating seed coat development . To test this hypothesis , we generated triple mutant plants that have reduced PRC2 function and produce auxin ectopically in the integuments by combining mutant alleles for yuc6-2d , vrn2/- and emf2/+ . No differences in integument cell number were observed in these mutants , compared to WT , implying that autonomous ovule growth is mediated by cell expansion ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . By scoring protoanthocyanidin production as a proxy for seed coat formation we compared the number of ovules forming autonomous seed coat in this triple mutant to those formed in the yuc6-2d single mutant and the vrn2/- emf2/+ double mutant . Ovules of the triple mutant and the yuc6-2d single mutant initiated autonomous seed coat development at similar frequencies ( Figure 6D ) , suggesting that auxin and PRC2 act in the same pathway . 10 . 7554/eLife . 20542 . 016Figure 6 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 20542 . 018 Based on the results showing that auxin is the endosperm-derived seed coat initiation signal , it seems most likely that auxin acts upstream of PRC2 during seed coat development . That being the case , autonomous seed coat development in mutants for the PRC2 core components VRN2 and EMF2 should not coincide with the\u00a0activation of auxin signaling in the integuments . To test this hypothesis , we crossed the DR5v2 and R2D2 auxin reporters into the vrn2 emf2 double mutant background . As predicted , despite that vrn2/+ emf2/+ ovules initiated seed coat development at 5 DAE , there was no detectable expression of DR5v2 , contrasting to its expression post-fertilization ( Figure 6E\u2013F and Figure 1B\u2013C ) . Similarly , we did not observe an efficient removal of the DII:VENUS signal from vrn2/- emf2/+ ovules , unlike what happens post-fertilization ( Figure 6G and Figure 1E ) . These observations strongly support the hypothesis that auxin acts upstream of the PRC2 complex , and might have a role in removing the PRC2-block on seed coat development . To investigate how PRC2 function is depleted following either fertilization or application of auxin , we analyzed transgenic lines expressing translational reporters for the PRC2 components MSI1 and SWN , as well as for the PRC2-associated protein LHP1 ( Derkacheva et al . , 2013 ) . Before fertilization there was a strong expression of all three reporters in the integuments , which markedly decreased following fertilization ( Figure 7 ) . Interestingly , a similar decrease in reporter activity was observed in unfertilized ovules following exogenous application of 2 , 4-D ( Figure 7C , F and I ) , but no changes were observed in mock-treated ovules ( Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . These observations support the view that post-fertilization auxin transport to the integuments leads to the removal of PRC2 and LHP1 proteins . To test whether the downregulation of PRC2 components occurred at the transcriptional level , we tested the expression of genes coding for sporophytic PRC2 components . All the genes tested were strongly downregulated after fertilization ( Figure 7J ) as well as after exogenous application of 2 , 4-D in unfertilized ovules ( Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . This data reveals that the auxin-dependent removal of PRC2 function is likely to occur at the transcriptional level; nevertheless , an additional post-translational regulation of PRC2 components by auxin cannot be completely ruled out . 10 . 7554/eLife . 20542 . 019Figure 7 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 20542 . 020 Given that GA signalling is downstream of auxin during seed development ( Figure 1F\u2013H ) , we asked whether the\u00a0seed coat growth in mutants for sporophytic PRC2s would coincide with the\u00a0ectopic activation of GA signaling in the integuments , similarly to what happens following application of auxin . Indeed , the GA biosynthesis gene GA20ox2 was upregulated in vrn2/- emf2/+ ovules while the GA catabolism genes GA2ox6 and GA2ox2 were downregulated when compared to WT ( Table 1\u2014source data 1 and Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . To further test this hypothesis , we crossed the GA reporter RGA::GFP:RGA into mutants deficient for either PRC2 components VRN2 and EMF2 or SWN and CLF , and analyzed GFP expression in unfertilized ovules . Indeed , when compared to WT ovules , the ovules mutant for vrn2/+ emf2/+ or swn/+ clf/+ had a strongly reduced GFP:RGA signal , particularly in the innermost layers of the integuments ( Figure 6H\u2013J ) This was observed both at 5 DAE , when the autonomous seeds were significantly larger than WT ovules , but also at 2 DAE , indicating that activation of GA signalling takes place shortly after anthesis ( Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . This decreased signal is most likely due to RGA protein degradation , since the RGA gene was not downregulated in the vrn2/- emf2/+ mutant ( Table 1\u2014source data 1 and Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . We conclude that GA signaling is activated in the absence of fertilization , when PRC2 function is removed from the integuments . \n In this manuscript we reveal that auxin is the missing link connecting fertilization and seed coat development . As the maternal integuments do not take part in the fertilization process , the signal that coordinates the development of the fertilization products with the maternal integuments remained elusive ( Figueiredo and K\u00f6hler , 2016 ) . Based on previous research it seemed likely that the signal is generated in the endosperm , as endosperm development is required to drive seed coat initiation in Arabidopsis ( Weijers et al . , 2003; Ingouff et al . , 2006; Roszak and K\u00f6hler , 2011 ) . It was furthermore known that the presence of the paternal genome is necessary for the seed coat to develop , as mutants for cdka;1 and fbl17 , in which one of the sperm cells fails to undergo karyogamy with the central cell , do not develop a seed coat ( Gusti et al . , 2009; Aw et al . , 2010 ) . These observations strongly suggest that the signal driving seed coat development should be dependent on genes that are paternally-expressed in the endosperm . Auxin biosynthesis following fertilization of the central cell is dependent on the paternally-expressed genes YUC10 and TAR1 ( Figueiredo et al . , 2015 ) , raising the hypothesis that auxin could be the trigger for seed coat initiation . In this manuscript we provide multiple lines of evidence supporting this hypothesis: ( i ) auxin rapidly accumulates in the integuments after fertilization , ( ii ) impaired auxin biosynthesis but not auxin signaling in the endosperm causes defects in seed coat development , ( iii ) ovules of transgenic lines producing auxin ectopically in the central cell initiate seed coat development without fertilization , ( iv ) failure of seed coat development in the agl62 mutant correlates with failure to export auxin . Collectively , our data strongly support the hypothesis that auxin generated in the fertilized central cell/endosperm is the trigger for seed coat formation . Impaired auxin signaling in the endosperm did not impair seed coat formation , strongly supporting the hypothesis that auxin is exported to the integuments , where it initiates downstream signaling events . We could show that the ABCB transporter PGP10 is expressed in the fertilized central cell and its expression depends on the type I MADS-box transcription factor AGL62 , suggesting that PGP10 may regulate the export of auxin from the endosperm to the integuments . PGPs are known to depend on additional proteins for their localization and function ( Bouchard et al . , 2006; Wu et al . , 2010; Wang et al . , 2013 ) , likely explaining our failure to restore seed coat development in agl62 by ectopically expressing PGP10 . It is furthermore possible that additional AGL62 targets are required for successful auxin export from the endosperm and are therefore lacking in the agl62 mutant . Future research will focus on identifying the remaining factors required for PGP10 function . Post-fertilization auxin production was shown to lead to activation of GA biosynthesis in the ovules , which is then transported to the valves to promote silique growth ( Dorcey et al . , 2009 ) . Our observation that auxin produced in the central cell is sufficient to drive parthenocarpic growth of the silique couples the fertilization event to fruit development . We have previously shown that auxin drives endosperm development in Arabidopsis ( Figueiredo et al . , 2015 ) . We now propose a dual role for post-fertilization auxin production , both in driving endosperm and seed coat development . Additionally , the agl62 mutant has defects both in seed coat development in fertilized ovules and endosperm development in autonomous seeds . This suggests that AGL62 , like auxin , is involved in mediating both endosperm and seed coat developmental pathways . It was recently proposed that AGL62 in the endosperm also mediates non-autonomous cell signalling driving nucellus degeneration ( Xu et al . , 2016 ) . This transcription factor thus seems to be a central player in modulating diverse developmental pathways during seed development . While ectopic auxin production in the central cell was sufficient to initiate seed coat development , the autonomous seeds did not reach the final size of a fertilized seed and collapsed at around 6\u20137 DAE . This implies that auxin is sufficient to initiate seed coat development , but that additional signals are necessary to support its full expansion and prevent the degeneration of the ovule . Recent work has shown that the innermost layer of the outer ovule integument perceives mechanical cues from the expanding endosperm , which affects cell wall thickening and GA metabolism in that cell layer ( Creff et al . , 2015 ) . It is therefore an attractive hypothesis that auxin is the initial paternally-derived signal that drives the integument-to-seed coat developmental transition , and that mechanical pressure from the syncytial endosperm sustains seed coat growth . This view is supported by observations showing that mutants affected in syncytial endosperm proliferation have smaller seeds when compared to WT plants ( Garcia et al . , 2003; Luo et al . , 2005; Zhou et al . , 2009; Wang et al . , 2010 ) . Conversely , a gain-of-function mutation in SHORT HYPOCOTYL UNDER BLUE1 results in increased proliferation of the syncytial endosperm delayed cellularization and increased seed size ( Zhou et al . , 2009 ) . Additionally , it cannot be ruled out that other signalling pathways contribute to sustain seed coat growth , such as small peptide-mediated signalling ( Ingram and Gutierrez-Marcos , 2015; Figueiredo and K\u00f6hler , 2016 ) Mutants in sporophytic PRC2 components develop seed coat autonomously , implying that the PRC2 imposes a block on seed coat development that has to be lifted upon fertilization ( Roszak and K\u00f6hler , 2011 ) . Here , we demonstrate that ectopic auxin can bypass the PRC2 block on seed coat development , which leads to activation of GA signaling and production of protoanthocyanidins in the integuments . We propose that transport of auxin from the developing endosperm is required for the removal of PRC2 function in the integuments , allowing for the development of the seed coat by activation of GA signaling ( Figure 8 ) . Also in mammals PRC2 regulates the transition from proliferation to differentiation during organogenesis and PRC2 function has to be removed to allow differentiation of embryonic stem cells ( Leeb et al . , 2010; Aldiri and Vetter , 2012 ) . We further show that exogenous auxin is sufficient to remove PRC2 function from the ovule integuments . Our gene expression analysis revealed that sporophytic PRC2-coding genes are downregulated after fertilization , likely due to increased auxin signalling in the integuments . Auxin is known to extensively modulate transcription ( Weijers and Wagner , 2016 ) , but the mechanism by which it regulates PRC2-coding genes is yet to be understood . In fact , although there are reports on the transcriptional regulation of PRC2 genes in animals ( Neri et al . , 2012 ) , there is very little information on how the\u00a0plant PRC2 activity is regulated . Thus , we provide the first evidence on the modulation of the\u00a0PRC2 activity by a plant hormone , as a way to modulate developmental transitions . 10 . 7554/eLife . 20542 . 021Figure 8 . Model for the post-fertilization mechanism driving seed coat development . Before fertilization ( left panel ) sporophytic PRC2 represses seed coat developmental pathways . The fertilization of the central cell ( middle panel ) results in the production of auxin that is exported to the integuments , lifting the PRC2 block on seed coat development and allowing for cell elongation and differentiation . However , this process is highly dependent on the activity of the transcription factor AGL62 , since agl62 seeds fail to export auxin from the endosperm . This leads to auxin accumulation and consequently , failure to develop a seed coat ( right panel ) . We propose that AGL62 activity is important for the expression , and eventually for the activity , of endosperm-specific auxin-exporters . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 20542 . 021 In conclusion , we have discovered that auxin produced in the fertilized central cell is required to induce seed coat formation after fertilization and most likely acts as mobile signal linking fertilization with the\u00a0differentiation of the surrounding sporophytic tissues . \n The Arabidopsis thaliana mutants and reporters used were described previously: emf2-5 ( Yang et al . , 1995 ) , vrn2-1 ( Chandler et al . , 1996 ) , swn-3 ( Chanvivattana et al . , 2004 ) , clf-9 ( Goodrich et al . , 1997 ) , wei8-1/- tar1/- tar2-1/+ and wei8-1/- tar1/- tar2-2/+ ( Stepanova et al . , 2008 ) , axr1-12/+ axl-1/- ( Dharmasiri et al . , 2007 ) , agl62-2/+ ( Kang et al . , 2008 ) , hal/+ ( Mayer et al . , 1999 ) , SWN::SWN:YFP ( Wang et al . , 2006 ) , and LHP1::LHP1:GFP ( Kotake et al . , 2003 ) . Seeds were sterilized in 5% commercial bleach and 0 . 01% Tween-20 for 10 min and washed three times in sterile ddH2O . Sterile seeds were plated on \u00bd MS-medium ( 0 . 43% MS-salts , 0 . 8% Bacto Agar , 0 . 19% MES hydrate and 1% Sucrose; when necessary , the medium was supplemented with the appropriate antibiotics ) and stratified at 4\u00b0C in the dark for 48 hr . Plates were then transferred to a growth chamber ( 16 hr light/8 hr dark; 110 \u03bcmol . s\u22121 . m\u22122; 21\u00b0C; 70% humidity ) . After 10 days seedlings were transferred to soil and grown in a growth chamber ( 16 hr light/8 hr dark; 110 \u03bcmol . s\u22121 . m\u22122; 21\u00b0C; 70% humidity ) . The solutions used for hormone treatments contained 5% EtOH , 0 . 05% Tween-20 and 200 \u03bcM of 2 , 4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid ( 2 , 4-D ) or 200 \u03bcM Gibberellic acid ( GA3 ) . In all experiments a mock control was run in parallel . Flowers were emasculated two days before anthesis and treated at 2 DAE by covering the whole pistils with 2 \u03bcL of the respective solution . The treated pistils were then collected at the specified time-points and processed for microscopy analyses , as described below . WT ( Ler ) and double mutant vrn2/- emf2/+ plants were emasculated at 1\u20132 days prior to anthesis . Two days after emasculation half of the WT plants were hand-pollinated . Unfertilized ovules and young seeds were dissected from the siliques at 4 DAE and 2 DAP , respectively , collected in RNAlater ( Sigma-Aldrich Chemie GmbH , Switzerland ) and ground frozen in a Silamat S5 for 3 times 7 s . Three biological replicates were generated per sample . RNA was extracted using the QIAGEN RNeasy KIT followed by on-column DNase treatment ( QIAGEN Instruments AB , Switzerland ) . Labeling and hybridization to AGRONOMICS1 arrays ( Affymetrix UK Ltd . , United Kingdom ) was done as described ( Hennig et al . , 2003 ) . Signal values were derived from Affymetrix CEL files using RMA ( RRID:SCR_008549 ) ( Rehrauer et al . , 2010 ) . All data processing was done using the statistics package R ( version 2 . 6 . 2 , RRID:SCR_001905 ) that is freely available at http://www . rproject . org/ . Quality control was done using the affyQCReport package in R ( RRID:SCR_001318 ) . In addition , coefficients of variation ( cv ) were calculated between replicates as a quantitative measure of data quality and consistency between replicates as described previously ( K\u00f6hler et al . , 2003 ) . Differentially expressed genes were identified using the limma package in R ( RRID:SCR_010943 ) ( Smyth , 2004 ) . Multiple\u2010testing correction was done using the q\u2010value method ( Storey and Tibshirani , 2003 ) . Probesets were called significantly differentially expressed when q\u00a0<\u00a00 . 05 . The genes used in the analysis were selected by overlapping the list of significantly upregulated genes in 2 DAP seeds and in vrn2 emf2 ovules . The list of commonly upregulated genes was then used to determine enriched GO-terms using AtCOECIS . Only significantly enriched biological processes were considered ( p-value<0 . 05 ) . REVIGO was used to remove redundant GO terms and summarize the list . For the transcriptome analysis of agl62 seeds , we made use of homozygous agl62 mutant plants that arise at low frequency and that form small amounts of viable agl62/- seeds . agl62 plants were emasculated 1\u20132 days prior to anthesis , hand-pollinated and seeds were harvested 30 hr after pollination . Three biological replicates were generated per sample . Isolation of RNA and preparation of libraries was done as previously described ( Wolff et al . , 2015 ) . RNA was sequenced at the Functional Genomics Center Zurich ( Switzerland ) on an Illumina HiSeq2000 ( Ilumina , San Diego , USA ) on two lanes in 100 bp paired end fashion . Sequencing reads were aligned to the TAIR 10 . 0 version of the Arabidopsis reference genome ( Col-0 ) using TopHat ( RRID:SCR_013035 ) ( Trapnell et al . , 2009 ) . Only uniquely mapping reads were used for further analysis . Differentially expressed genes were identified using the DESeq package ( Anders and Huber , 2010 ) . Analysis of GO categories was performed using AtCOECiS ( Vandepoele et al . , 2009 ) and REVIGO ( RRID:SCR_005825 ) ( Supek et al . , 2011 ) . To enrich for biologically relevant changes , probesets with signal log ratio ( SLR ) >\u00a00 . 6 were selected for the transcriptome analysis of vrn2/- emf2/+ and with SLR<\u22121 for the analysis of agl62 . Affymetrix data and sequencing reads are deposited as CEL and fastq files , respectively , in the Gene Expression Omnibus ( RRID:SCR_005012 ) ( datasets GSE85751 and GSE85848 ) . To clone the promoters of PGP10 , BAN and AGL62 , as well as the coding region of GA3ox1 and PGP10 , WT Col-0 genomic DNA was used as a template . The primer sequences can be found in Table 2 . The amplified fragments were purified from the gel , recombined into the donor vector ( pDONR221 ) to create entry clones , and sequenced . Gateway cloning was done according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions ( Invitrogen , Fisher Scientific , Sweden ) . The promoter of PGP10 was recombined into vector pB7FWG . 0 . The coding region of GA3ox1 and PGP10 were recombined into vector pB7WG2 , where the 35 s promoter was replaced by that of BAN and AGL62 , respectively , using the restriction enzymes SacI and SpeI . The MSI1 translational reporter was obtained by replacing the TAP fragment in the MSI::MSI1:TAP construct with GFP ( Bouveret et al . , 2006 ) . The BAN::GFP reporter was generated by recombining the amplified promoter sequence of BAN and the coding sequence of GFP into the pBGW vector . Recombination was done using the In-Fusion enzyme ( Clontech , Takara Bio Europe , France ) , following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions . 10 . 7554/eLife . 20542 . 022Table 2 .

Transformants were selected with the appropriate antibiotics . For clearing of ovules and seeds the whole pistils/siliques were fixed with EtOH:acetic acid ( 9:1 ) , washed for 10 min in 90% EtOH , 10 min in 70% EtOH and cleared over-night in chloralhydrate solution ( 66 . 7% chloralhydrate ( w/w ) , 8 . 3% glycerol ( w/w ) ) . The ovules/seeds were observed under differential interference contrast ( DIC ) optics using a Zeiss Axioplan or Axioscope A1 microscopes ( Carl Zeiss AB , Sweden ) . The vanillin staining was done on 5 DAE ovules in 1% ( w/v ) vanillin ( 4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzaldehyde ) in 6 N HCl . The emasculated pistils were incubated in this solution for 30 min and then the ovules were dissected out and mounted on a microscope slide . Images were recorded using a Leica DFC295 camera with a 0 . 63x optical adapter ( Leica Microsystems , Sweden ) . For fluorescence analysis seeds were mounted in 7% glucose . Where indicated , 0 . 1 mg/mL propidium iodide ( PI ) was used . Samples were analyzed under confocal microscopy on a Zeiss 780 Inverted Axio Observer with a supersensitive GaASp detector with the following settings ( in nm; excitation-ex and emission-em ) : GFP \u2013 ex 488 , em 499\u2013525; PI \u2013 ex 488/514 , em 635\u2013719; YFP ( VENUS ) \u2013 ex 514 , em 499\u2013552 for DR5v2 and 525\u2013543 for DII; tdTomato \u2013 ex 561 , em 599\u2013622 . Images were acquired , analyzed and exported using Zeiss ZEN software . For Feulgen staining of seeds , fixation , staining and embedding were performed as described ( Braselton et al . , 1996 ) . Confocal imaging was performed using a Leica SP1-2 , excitation wavelengths were set to 488 nm and detection to 535 nm and longer . Ovule size and cell number measurements ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2 ) were performed through confocal imaging of PI stained ovules . Each ovule was imaged at the median longitudinal plane , and its area was subsequently measured using the ImageJ software ( RRID:SCR_002285 ) ( Schneider et al . , 2012 ) . For each condition , the area of 10 ovules was measured . Average ovule area for each condition was normalized to the average area of mock treated ovules . The determination of integument cell number in all lines was done for the outer layer of the inner integument at 2 DAE and 10 ovules were analyzed per line . Ovule and seed area measurements for WT and auxin mutants ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1 ) were performed through seed clearing ( as described above ) and measured using ImageJ software ( RRID:SCR_002285 ) ( Schneider et al . , 2012 ) . An average of 50 ovules/seeds was measured for each line per time-point . Ovules/seeds of 25 emasculated or hand-pollinated WT siliques were harvested at 2DAE , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 and 5 DAP in 20 \u03bcL of RNAlater solution ( Invitrogen ) and ground for 2 min using a TissueLyser II ( Qiagen\u00a0AB , Sweden ) .

{"lay_summary": "Bacteria can cause diseases , but they also battle their own microscopic enemies: a group of viruses known as bacteriophages . For instance , the T7 bacteriophage preys on various strains of Escherichia coli , a type of bacteria often found in the human gut . While many E . coli strains are inoffensive or even beneficial to human health , some can be deadly . Finding a way to kill harmful strains while sparing the helpful ones would be a helpful addition to the medicine toolkit . Bacteriophages identify and interact with their specific target through a structure known as the receptor binding protein , or RBP . However , it is still unclear exactly how RBP helps the viruses recognize which type of bacteria to infect . Here , Huss et al . set to map out and modify this structure in T7 bacteriophage so the virus is more efficient and specific about which strain of E . coli it kills . First , the role of each building block in the tip of RBP was meticulously dissected; this generated the knowledge required to genetically engineer a large number of different T7 bacteriophages , each with a slightly variation in their RBP . These viruses were then exposed to various strains of bacteria . Monitoring the bacteriophages that survived and multiplied the most after infecting different strains of E . coli revealed which RBP building blocks are important for efficiency and specificity . This was then confirmed by engineering highly active T7 bacteriophage variants against an E . coli strain that causes urinary tract infections . These findings demonstrate that even small changes to the bacteriophages can make a big difference to their ability to infect their preys . The approaches developed by Huss et al . help to understand exactly how the RBP allows a virus to infect a specific type of bacteria; this could one day pave the way for new therapies that harness those viruses to fight increasingly resistant bacterial infections .", "article": "The interaction between a bacteriophage and its host is mediated by the phage's receptor binding protein ( RBP ) . Despite its fundamental role in governing phage activity and host range , molecular rules of RBP function remain a mystery . Here , we systematically dissect the functional role of every residue in the tip domain of T7 phage RBP ( 1660 variants ) by developing a high-throughput , locus-specific , phage engineering method . This rich dataset allowed us to cross compare functional profiles across hosts to precisely identify regions of functional importance , many of which were previously unknown . Substitution patterns showed host-specific differences in position and physicochemical properties of mutations , revealing molecular adaptation to individual hosts . We discovered gain-of-function variants against resistant hosts and host-constricting variants that eliminated certain hosts . To demonstrate therapeutic utility , we engineered highly active T7 variants against a urinary tract pathogen . Our approach presents a generalized framework for characterizing sequence\u2013function relationships in many phage\u2013bacterial systems . \n Bacteriophages ( or \u2018phages\u2019 ) shape microbial ecosystems by infecting and killing targeted bacterial species . As a result , they are promising tools for treatment of antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections and microbiome manipulation ( Canfield and Duerkop , 2020; Chen et al . , 2014; Clokie et al . , 2011; Dedrick et al . , 2019; Kilcher and Loessner , 2019; Kutter et al . , 2015; Mizuno et al . , 2020; Sausset et al . , 2020; Schooley et al . , 2017; Shen et al . , 2015; Shkoporov and Hill , 2019; De Sordi et al . , 2019 ) . Interaction of phages with their bacterial receptors is a key determinant of their host range and virulence ( Bertozzi Silva et al . , 2016; de Jonge et al . , 2019; Rousset et al . , 2018 ) . This interaction is primarily mediated by the receptor binding proteins ( RBPs ) of the phage ( Nobrega et al . , 2018 ) . RBPs enable phages to adsorb to diverse cell surface molecules , including proteins , polysaccharides , lipopolysaccharides ( LPS ) , and carbohydrate-binding moieties . Phages exhibit high functional plasticity through genetic alterations to RBPs and by natural and laboratory-guided evolution , which can modulate activity and host range to different hosts and environments ( Ando et al . , 2015; Chen et al . , 2017; Dedrick et al . , 2019; Dunne et al . , 2019; Garcia et al . , 2003; Gebhart et al . , 2017; Holtzman et al . , 2020; Lin et al . , 2012; Meyer et al . , 2012; Yehl et al . , 2019; Yosef et al . , 2017 ) . In essence , survivability of a phage is intimately linked to the adaptability of its RBP . The challenge now is to understand the molecular code of RBPs in sufficient depth to enable predictable manipulation of host range and virulence . We sought to do so by combining deep mutational scanning ( DMS ) of the RBP with powerful selections on multiple hosts . Although RBPs remain the focus of many mechanistic , structural , and evolutionary studies and are a prime target for engineering , we currently lack a systematic and comprehensive understanding of how RBP mutations influence phage activity and host range . Though insightful , directed evolution enriches only a small group of \u2018winners\u2019 , which makes it difficult to glean a comprehensive mutational landscape of the RBP ( Holtzman et al . , 2020 ) . Random mutagenesis-based screens generate multi-mutant variants whose individual effects cannot be easily deconvolved ( Dunne et al . , 2019; Yehl et al . , 2019 ) . Other approaches including swapping homologous RBPs lead to gain of function; however , the underlying molecular determinants of function can be difficult to explain ( Ando et al . , 2015; Chen et al . , 2017; Gebhart et al . , 2017; Yosef et al . , 2017 ) . In summary , despite the extraordinary functional potential of phage RBPs , how systematic changes to their sequence shape the overall functional landscape of a phage remains unknown . Here , we carried out DMS , a high-throughput experimental technique , of the tip domain of the T7 phage RBP ( tail fiber ) to uncover molecular determinants of activity and host range . The tip domain is the distal region of the tail fiber that makes primary contact with the host receptor ( Gonz\u00e1lez-Garc\u00eda et al . , 2015; Molineux , 2001; Qimron et al . , 2006 ) . We developed ORACLE ( Optimized Recombination , Accumulation , and Library Expression ) , a high-throughput , locus-specific , phage genome engineering method to create a large , unbiased library of phage variants at a targeted gene locus . Using ORACLE , we systematically and comprehensively mutated the tip domain by making all single amino acid substitutions at every site ( 1660 variants ) and quantified the functional role of all variants on multiple bacterial hosts . We generated high-resolution functional maps delineating regions concentrated with function-enhancing substitutions and host-specific substitutional patterns , many of which were previously unknown . We discovered T7 variants with far greater virulence than wildtype T7 , demonstrating that even those natural phages that are well adapted to a host can be engineered for higher efficacy . However , many variants highly adapted to one host performed poorly on others , underscoring a tradeoff between activity and host range . This functional screening highlights ideal regions of the tip domain for engineering host range . Furthermore , we demonstrated the functional potential of RBPs by discovering gain-of-function variants against resistant hosts and host-constriction variants that selectively eliminate specific hosts . To demonstrate the therapeutic value of ORACLE , we engineered T7 variants that avert emergence of spontaneous resistance in pathogenic Escherichia coli causing urinary tract infections ( UTIs ) . Our study explains the molecular drivers of adaptability of the tip domain and identifies key functional regions determining activity and host range . ORACLE provides a generalized framework to describe sequence\u2013function relationships in phages to elucidate the molecular basis of phages , the most abundant life form on earth . \n ORACLE is a high-throughput precision phage genome engineering technology designed to create a large , unbiased library of phage variants to investigate sequence\u2013function relationships in phages . ORACLE overcomes three major hurdles . First , phage variants are created during the natural infection cycle of the phage , which eliminates a common bottleneck from transforming DNA libraries . By recombining a donor cassette containing prespecified variants to a targeted site on the phage genome , ORACLE allows sequence programmability and generalizability to phages with transformable bacterial hosts capable of maintaining a plasmid library . Second , ORACLE minimizes library bias that can rapidly arise due to fitness advantage or deficiency of any variant on the propagating host that may then be amplified due to exponential phage growth . Minimizing bias is critical because variants that perform poorly on a propagating host but well on targeted hosts may disappear during propagation . Third , ORACLE prevents extreme abundance of wildtype over variants , which allows for resolving and scoring even small functional differences between variants . The development of this technology was necessary to overcome challenges with existing engineering approaches for creating a large , unbiased phage library . Direct transformation of phage libraries , while ideal for creating one or small groups of synthetic phages , will not work because phage genomes are typically too large for library transformation ( Ando et al . , 2015; Kilcher et al . , 2018; Marinelli et al . , 2008; Marinelli et al . , 2019 ) . Homologous recombination has low , variable recombination rates and high levels of wildtype phage are retained , which mask library members ( Pires et al . , 2016; Yehl et al . , 2019 ) . Libraries of lysogenic phages could potentially be made using conventional bacterial genome engineering tools as the phage integrates into the host genome . However , this approach is not applicable to obligate lytic phages . Our desire to develop ORACLE for obligate lytic phages is motivated by their mandated use for phage therapy . Any phage , including lysogenic phages , with a sequenced genome and a transformable host that can maintain a plasmid library should be amenable to ORACLE . ORACLE is carried out in four steps: ( a ) making acceptor phage , ( b ) inserting gene variants through recombination , ( c ) accumulating recombined phages , and ( d ) expressing the library for selection ( Figure 1A ) . An \u2018acceptor phage\u2019 is a synthetic phage genome where the gene of interest ( i . e . , tail fiber ) is replaced with a fixed sequence flanked by Cre recombinase sites to serve as a landing site for inserting variants ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . We created T7 acceptor phages by assembling PCR fragments of the phage genome in yeast ( Ando et al . , 2015; Jaschke et al . , 2012 ) ( see Materials and methods ) . T7 acceptor phages lacking a wildtype tail fiber gene cannot plaque on E . coli and do not spontaneously reacquire the tail fiber during propagation ( Figure 1B , Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A ) . Furthermore , the T7 acceptor phages have no plaquing deficiency relative to wildtype when the tail fiber gene is provided from a helper plasmid ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A ) . Thus , the tail fiber gene is decoupled from the rest of the phage genome for interrogation of function . Next , phage variants are generated within the host during the infection cycle by Optimized Recombination by inserting tail fiber variants from a donor plasmid into the landing sites in the acceptor phage using site-specific recombination . To minimize biasing of variants during propagation , a helper plasmid constitutively provides the wildtype tail fiber in trans such that all progeny phages can amplify comparably regardless of the fitness benefit or deficient of any variant . At this stage , we typically have\u00a0approximately\u00a01 recombined phage among 1000 acceptor phages ( Figure 1C ) . To enrich recombined phages in this pool , we passage all progeny phages on E . coli expressing Cas9 and a gRNA targeting the fixed sequence flanked by recombinase sites we introduced into the acceptor phage . The helper plasmid is retained during this stage to continue minimizing bias by providing the wildtype tail fiber in trans . As a result , only unrecombined phages will be inhibited while recombined phages with tail fiber variants are Accumulated without bias . The Cas9-gRNA system successfully inhibits acceptor phages but has no effect on plaquing of untargeted phages ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A\u2013D ) . Recombined phages were highly enriched by over one\u00a0thousandfold in the phage population when an optimized gRNA targeting the fixed sequence was used , whereas a randomized control gRNA yielded no enrichment of recombined phages ( Figure 1D , Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2E , F ) . In the final step , phages are propagated on E . coli which lack the helper plasmid that previously provided the wildtype tail fiber in trans to prevent bias . In this Library Expression , propagation on this host allows for full expression of the library variant \u2013 this is the first time during library creation that the variant is fully expressed on the phage particle . We sequenced the distribution of the library of tail fiber variants integrated on the phage genome after ORACLE . We compared this distribution to the distribution of variants on the recombination plasmid library to evaluate how effective ORACLE was at integrating variants and preventing bias during library creation . The post-ORACLE phages were mildly skewed toward more abundant members but remained generally evenly distributed and comparable to the distribution of variants in the input donor plasmid library , retaining 99 . 8% coverage ( Figure 1E ) . Comparison of variant libraries with and without DNAse treatment was well correlated ( R\u00a0=\u00a00 . 994 ) , indicating no unencapsidated phage genomes influenced library distribution ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3 ) . In summary , ORACLE is a generalizable tool for creating large , unbiased variant libraries of obligate lytic phages . These phage variants , including those that have a fitness deficiency on the host used to create the library , can all be characterized in a single selection experiment by deep sequencing phage populations before and after selection in a host . Compared to traditional plaque assays , this represents increased throughput by nearly 3\u20134 orders of magnitude . DMS is a high-throughput experimental technique to characterize sequence\u2013function relationships through large-scale mutagenesis coupled to selection and deep sequencing . The scale and depth of DMS is used to reveal sites critical for activity , host specificity , and stability in a protein . DMS has been employed to study many proteins , including enzymes , transcription factors , signaling domains , and viral surface proteins ( Fowler and Fields , 2014; Lee et al . , 2018; Raman et al . , 2014; Romero et al . , 2015 ) . Bacteriophage T7 is a podovirus that infects E . coli . T7 has a short non-contractile tail made up of three proteins , including the tail fiber encoded by gp17 . Each of the six tail fibers is a homotrimer composed of a relatively rigid shaft ending with a \u03b2-sandwich tip domain connected by a short loop ( Garcia-Doval and van Raaij , 2012 ) . The tip domain is likely the very first region of the tail fiber to interact with host LPS and position the phage for successful , irreversible binding with the host ( Gonz\u00e1lez-Garc\u00eda et al . , 2015; Molineux , 2001; Qimron et al . , 2006 ) . The tip domain is a major determinant of host range and activity and is often naturally exchanged between phages to readily adapt to new hosts ( Fraser et al . , 2006; Fraser et al . , 2007; Lin et al . , 2012 ) . Even single amino acid substitutions to this domain are sufficient to alter host range between E . coli strains ( Heineman et al . , 2008 ) . Due to its critical functional role , we chose the tip domain to comprehensively characterize phage activity and host range by DMS . We generated a library of 1660 single mutation variants of the tip domain , prespecified as chip-based oligonucleotides , where all 19 non-synonymous and 1 nonsense substitution were made at each codon spanning residue positions 472\u2013554 ( Figure 2A , residue numbering based on PDB 4A0T ) . Using ORACLE , the library was inserted into T7 to generate variants to be selected and deep sequenced ( Figure 2B ) on three laboratory E . coli hosts: B strain derivative BL21 , K-12 derivative BW25113 , and DH10B derivative 10G . Each variant was given a functional score , F , based on the ratio of their relative abundance before and after selection consisting of an estimated four infection cycles , which was then normalized to wildtype to yield FN , where wildtype FN\u00a0=\u00a01 ( Figure 2C\u2013E , see Materials and methods ) . Selection on each host gave excellent correlation across biological triplicates ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . To validate the functional relevance of the screen , we hypothesized that the flexible C-terminal end ( residue positions 552\u2013554 and a three-residue extension if the stop codon is substituted ) is unlikely to have any structural or host recognition role . As expected , these positions broadly tolerated nearly all substitutions across all three hosts , indicating that the functional scores likely reflect true biological effects ( Figure 2C\u2013E ) . We compared the activities of phage variants across hosts to assess their fitness and evolutionary adaptation to each host . Between the three hosts , T7 variants appeared most and least adapted to BW25113 and 10G , respectively , as evidenced by the fraction of depleted variants ( FN\u00a0<\u00a00 . 1 ) after selection on each host ( 10G: 0 . 66\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00 . 03; BL21: 0 . 59\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00 . 01; and BW25113: 0 . 51\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00 . 01; all significantly different from each other with p<0 . 05 ) ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2A\u2013C ) . Furthermore , wildtype T7 fared relatively poorly on 10G ( F\u00a0=\u00a00 . 77\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00 . 05 ) , indicating a fitness impediment , but performed significantly better on BL21 ( F\u00a0=\u00a02 . 92\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00 . 2 , p\u00a0<\u00a00 . 01 ) and BW25113 ( F\u00a0=\u00a02 . 26\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00 . 1 , p\u00a0<\u00a00 . 01 ) ( Figure 2\u2014source data 1 ) . The fitness impediment gave many more variants competitive advantage , resulting in greater enrichment ( FN\u00a0>\u00a02 ) over wildtype on 10G ( 48 variants ) compared to BL21 ( 2 variants ) and BW25113 ( 16 variants ) ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2A\u2013C ) . In fact , the best performing variants on 10G were 10 times more enriched than wildtype , suggesting substantially higher activity ( Figure 2F , Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2D ) . Examining enriched variants on each host ( FN\u00a0>\u00a02 ) provides compelling evidence of the tradeoff between activity and host range ( Figure 2F , Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2E ) . The top ranked variants on each host were remarkably distinct from those on other hosts ( except G479Q shared between 10G and BL21 ) . Hierarchical clustering of FN across all three hosts revealed grouping of similar variants that performed better selectively on some hosts but not others ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3 ) . No variant performed exceptionally well on all hosts ( FN\u00a0>\u00a02 , Figure 2F ) ; however , 406 variants were tolerated on all three hosts ( Figure 2\u2014source data 2 ) . Thus , specialization toward a host comes at the cost of sacrificing breadth , mirroring observations made of natural phage populations ( Elena et al . , 2009 ) . We investigated the global physicochemical properties and topological preferences of substitutions after selection on each host ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2F\u2013H ) . On 10G , there was enrichment of larger and more hydrophilic amino acids and depletion of hydrophobic amino acids ( all p\u00a0<\u00a00 . 001 , r\u00a0>\u00a00 . 12 ) , which is visually striking on the heatmap ( see R , K , and H substitutions\u00a0in Figure 2C ) . In contrast , no significant enrichment or depletion was observed on BL21 ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2F\u2013H ) . This is consistent with our earlier observation that wildtype T7 is generally well adapted to BL21 since it had the fewest variants outperforming wildtype . We reasoned that since BL21 has been used to propagate T7 it may have already adapted well to this host over time . On BW25113 , hydrophobic residues were modestly enriched ( all p\u00a0<\u00a00 . 034 , r\u00a0>\u00a00 . 07 ) ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2H ) , a trend opposite to 10G . This provides a molecular explanation as to why high-scoring substitutions on one host fare poorly on others ( Figure 2F ) . We mapped positions of enriched substitutions ( FN\u00a0\u2265\u00a02 ) on each host onto the structure to determine topologically distinct patterns of substitution that may be masked in global comparisons of the entire tip domain ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2E ) . These fall predominantly on four exterior loops ( BC , DE , FG , and HI ) , the adjoining region ( \u03b2-strand H ) close to exterior loop HI , and less frequently on the \u2018side\u2019 of the tip domain . This suggests directionality to phage\u2013bacterial interactions and orientational bias of the tip domain with respect to the bacterial surface . Directionality and orientational bias is particularly valuable information since no high-resolution structure of this phage bound to receptor exists . Several key lessons emerged from these host screens . First , single amino acid substitutions alone can generate broad functional diversity , highlighting the evolutionary adaptability of the RBP . Second , T7 can be optimized and activity can be increased , even on hosts that T7 is already considered to grow well on . Third , enrichment patterns on each host follow broad trends but have nuance at each position . Next , we sought to elucidate features of each residue unique to each host or common across all hosts . There were over 30 residues with contrasting substitution patterns between different hosts , revealing fascinating features of receptor recognition for T7 ( Figure 2\u2014source data 2 ) . Here , we focus on five of these residues , N501 , R542 , G479 , D540 , and D520 , which showed starkly contrasting patterns of selection ( Figure 3A ) . N501 and R542 are located on exterior loops oriented away from the phage and toward the receptor ( Figure 3C ) . In fact , R542 forms a literal \u2018hook\u2019 to interact with the receptor ( Garcia-Doval and van Raaij , 2012 ) . On 10G and BL21 , only positively charged residues ( R , K , and H ) were tolerated at residues 501 and 542 , while in contrast many more substitutions were tolerated at both residues on BW25113 . One such substitution , R542Q , is the best performing variant on BW25113 ( FN\u00a0=\u00a03 . 31 ) but is conspicuously depleted on 10G and BL21 , suggesting that even subtle molecular disparities can lead to large biases in activity . The substitution profiles of G479 and D540 are loosely the inverse of N501 and R542 as many substitutions are tolerated on BL21 and 10G , but very few are tolerated on BW25113 ( Figure 3A ) . We hypothesize that D540 is critical for host\u00a0recognition on BW25113 . Since D540 , a receptor-facing position on an exterior loop , is only 6 \u00c5 from G479 , it is likely that any substitution at G479 may sterically hinder D540 , resulting in the noted depletion of G479 substitutions on BW25113 . This hypothesis is further supported by enrichment of adjacent S541D on BW25113 ( FN\u00a0=\u00a02 . 82 , the third highest scoring substitution ) , while this substitution is depleted on 10G and BL21 ( Figure 2\u2014source data 2 ) . D520 displays a third variation in substitution patterns where substitutions are generally tolerated on 10G and BW25113 , but not tolerated on BL21 ( Figure 3A ) . This loop is also oriented downward toward the receptor , and we hypothesize that D520 or the local region around this exterior loop is more important for receptor recognition in BL21 than it is for the other two hosts , mirroring the result for D540 for BW25113 . Another stark contrast can be drawn at adjacent S519 , where no substitutions are tolerated in BL21 or 10G but several substitutions are enriched on BW25113 , indicating that\u00a0substitutions can improve receptor binding on one host while reducing function on another host . Overall , these host-specific substitution patterns reveal a nuanced relationship between the tip domain composition and receptor preferences . We quantitatively characterized the role of every residue by integrating selection data across all hosts to reveal a functional map of the tip domain at granular resolution ( Figure 3B , C , Figure 3\u2014source data 1 ) . We classified every residue as \u2018intolerant\u2019 , \u2018tolerant\u2019 , or \u2018functional\u2019 based on aggregated FN scores of all substitutions across all three hosts at every residue . Our method of classifying functional regions was robust to adjusting the FN threshold used to identify functional variants ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . Residues where the majority of substitutions were depleted were considered intolerant to substitution , while residues where at least a third of substitutions were depleted in one host and tolerated or enriched in another host were considered functional; the remaining positions were considered tolerant ( see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods ) . The hydrophobic core comprising W474 , I495 , W496 , I497 , Y515 , W523 , L524 , F526 , I528 , F535 , and I548 is essential for stability and therefore is highly intolerant to substitutions ( Figure 3B ) . Other intolerant positions include an elaborate network of salt bridge interactions involving D489 , R491 , R493 , R508 , and D512 in the interior loops , which likely constrain the orientation of the tip domain relative to the shaft ( Figure 3C ) . Glycines generally provide conformational flexibility between secondary structure elements and normally tend to be mutable . Interestingly , several glycines ( G476 , G510 , G522 , and G532 ) are highly intolerant to substitutions . These glycines may be essential to minimize steric obstruction to adjacent larger residues , similar to G479 and D540 on BW25113 ( Figure 3C ) . For example , G510 and G532 may facilitate formation of salt bridges in the interior loop , while G476 and G522 may facilitate a required receptor interaction in exterior loops for all three hosts . It has been previously assumed that exterior loops are the primary functional region of the tip domain ( Garcia-Doval and van Raaij , 2012; Yehl et al . , 2019 ) . We found that functional positions did typically point outward and are densely concentrated along exterior loops BC , DE , FG , and HI , as well as adjacent \u03b2-sheet residues . This is consistent with two specificity-switching substitutions found in a previous study , D520Q and V544A , which are both located in exterior loops ( Heineman et al . , 2008 ) . However , several residues in exterior loops , such as G476 and S543 , were notably intolerant , indicating that\u00a0these residues may be poor targets for engineering or future combinatorial studies . Functional positions were also found in regions other than exterior loops , such as I514 , Q527 , and K536 , which are \u03b2-sheet residues located along one side of the tip domain ( Figure 3C ) . This suggests the phage can use the \u2018side\u2019 of the tip domain to engage the receptor , increasing the apparent functional area of the tip domain and highlighting several new regions as valuable engineering targets . We also determined if the functionally important regions could be predicted computationally as the ability to predict functionally important regions without DMS could rapidly accelerate engineering efforts . We used Rosetta , a state-of-the-art protein modeling software , to calculate the change in Gibbs free energy ( \u0394\u0394G ) for each of the 1660 mutations and compared this distribution to our DMS results ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1 , also see Materials and methods ) and generated a truth table to summarize results compared to our functional data ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3 ) . Predicted thermodynamic changes in stability mapped very well with over 93% of tolerated or functional positions having a substitution that was predicted to be stabilizing . The remaining 7% of tolerant or enriched substitutions were predicted to be destabilizing , and we hypothesize that this may indicate these substitutions result in improved dynamic or induced fit positioning of the tip domain for productive infection . Incorporating stability estimations could further improve the engineering power of the assay . For example , substitutions predicted to be stable but that are intolerant in the DMS assay may indicate that the substituted residue is necessary for all three hosts . Overall , these results paint a complex enrichment profile for each host with some broad trends but subtle host-specific effects . These results suggest that exterior loops and some outward-facing positions in \u03b2-sheets act as a reservoir of function-switching and function-enhancing mutations , likely promoting host-specific and orientation-dependent interactions between phage and bacterial receptors . Functional positions identified by this comparison are ideal engineering targets to customize host range and activity . The tail fiber is considered a reservoir of gain-of-function variants due to its principal role in determining fitness of a phage through host adsorption ( Holtzman et al . , 2020; Yehl et al . , 2019 ) . We hypothesized that novel gain-of-function variants against a resistant host could be discovered by subjecting our tail fiber variant library to selection on a resistant host . To identify a resistant host , we focused on host genes rfaG and rfaD involved in the biosynthesis of surface\u00a0LPS , which is a known receptor for T7 in E . coli ( Gonz\u00e1lez-Garc\u00eda et al . , 2015; Molineux , 2001; Qimron et al . , 2006 ) . Gene rfaG ( synonyms WaaG or pcsA ) transfers glucose to the outer core of LPS and deletion strains lack the outer core of LPS ( Pagnout et al . , 2019 ) , while rfaD ( synonyms gmhD or WaaD ) encodes a critical epimerase required for building the inner core of LPS ( Valvano et al . , 2002; Figure 4A ) . Deletion of either gene reduces the ability of T7 to infect E . coli by several orders of magnitude ( Figure 4F ) . We challenged the library of T7 variants against E . coli deletion strains BW25113\u0394rfaG and BW25113\u0394rfaD through pooled selection and deep sequencing as before ( Figure 2 ) and determined an FN score for each substitution on both strains ( Figure 4B , C ) . Independent replicates showed good correlation for BW25113\u0394rfaG ( R\u00a0=\u00a00 . 99 , 0 . 93 , 0 . 93 ) but only adequate correlation for BW25113\u0394rfaD ( R\u00a0=\u00a00 . 51 , 0 . 68 , 0 . 39 ) ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . Although the scale of FN was inconsistent across replicates on BW25113\u0394rfaD , the same substitutions were largely enriched in all three replicates , suggesting reproducibility of results ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3 ) . Inconsistencies in FN scores may arise due to severe loss of diversity causing stochastic differences in enrichment to become magnified across independent experiments and the four infection cycles used for selection . Separately we examined correlation after selection using only a single infection cycle , which produced more highly correlated results for BW25113\u0394rfaD ( R\u00a0=\u00a00 . 89 , 0 . 90 , 0 . 89 ) ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 4 ) , indicating\u00a0that fewer infection cycles may be ideal for future work with highly resistant hosts . We engineered several gain-of-function T7 variants that could infect both deletion strains with activity comparable to wildtype T7 infecting susceptible BW25113 ( Figure 4F ) . Low-sequence diversity and high enrichment scores of T7 variants indicate a strong selection bottleneck , which is consistent with diminished activity of wildtype T7 on the deletion strains . This is reflected in the significantly lower functional score of wildtype T7 on BW25113\u0394rfaG and BW25113\u0394rfaD ( F\u00a0=\u00a00 . 09\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00 . 3 and F\u00a0=\u00a00 . 03\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00 . 2 , respectively ) in comparison to BW25113 ( F\u00a0=\u00a02 . 26\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00 . 1 , p\u00a0<\u00a00 . 001 ) ( Figure 2\u2014source data 1 ) . The number of enriched variants outperforming wildtype T7 ( FN\u00a0\u2265\u00a02 ) on the deletion strains ( BW25113\u0394rfaG: 55 variants , 3 . 3% and BW25113\u0394rfaD: 68 variants , 4 . 1% ) was over three times higher than BW25113 ( 16 variants , 1% ) but comparable to 10G ( 48 variants , 2 . 9% ) ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2A , B ) . However , the enrichment scores of top performing variants such as G521H and G521R on BW25113\u0394rfaG and S541K and N501H on BW25113\u0394rfaD were over 100 times greater than wildtype T7 , suggesting strong gain\u00a0of\u00a0function on the deletion strains ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2C ) . Of the 78 variants with FN\u00a0\u2265\u00a02 on either deletion strain , 45 variants had FN\u00a0\u2265\u00a02 on both strains , indicating that variants that performed well on one strain typically performed well on the other strain . This implies that\u00a0the enriched variants may have broad affinity for truncated LPS but cannot discriminate based on the length of the LPS . Nonetheless , hydrophilic substitutions were more strongly enriched on BW25113\u0394rfaG ( p\u00a0<\u00a00 . 001 , r\u00a0>\u00a00 . 11 ) , but not as significantly on BW25113\u0394rfaD ( p\u00a0<\u00a00 . 033 , r\u00a0<\u00a00 . 10 ) , suggesting subtle differences in surface chemical properties of deletion strains leading to host-specific enrichments ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2D\u2013F ) . Indeed , there were several variants with contrasting F scores on both strains such as S541T ( BW25113\u0394rfaD FN\u00a0=\u00a044 . 8 , BW25113\u0394rfaG FN\u00a0=\u00a00 . 6 ) and G521E ( BW25113\u0394rfaD FN\u00a0=\u00a00 , BW25113\u0394rfaG FN\u00a0=\u00a017 . 4 ) , suggesting potential host preference . Most substitutions were concentrated in the exterior loops BG , FG , HI , and \u03b2-strand H , all pointing downward toward the bacterial surface , reinforcing the functional importance of these regions of the tip domain ( Figure 4D , E ) . Notably , the most enriched variants had large positively charged substitutions ( K , R , and H ) akin to the enrichment pattern on 10G , suggesting that\u00a0the bacterial surface of these truncated mutants likely resembles that of 10G . Our results are consistent with a recent continuous evolution study , which identified G480E and G521R as possible gain-of-function variants on a strain similar to BW25113\u0394rfaD and G479R and G521S as possible gain-of-function variants on BW25113\u0394rfaG ( Holtzman et al . , 2020 ) , although these variants only represent a small fraction of the gain-of-function variants discovered in our study . We validated the results of the pooled selection experiment by clonally testing the ability of phage variants with high FN ( A539R , G521H , and D540S ) to plaque on the deletion strains based on a standard efficiency of plating ( EOP ) assay . Indeed , EOP results showed significant gain of function in these variants on the deletion strains ( Figure 4F ) . D540S was particularly noteworthy as it performed better on the deletion strain BW25113\u0394rfaG over wildtype BW25113 by 1\u20132 orders of magnitude . Based on these results , we conclude that D540 is critical for infecting wildtype BW25113 ( Figure 3 ) likely by interacting with the outer core of LPS . When the outer core of the LPS is missing ( BW25113\u0394rfaG ) , a substitution at this position becomes necessary for adsorption either to a different LPS moiety or to an alternative receptor . We introduced stop codon at every position to systematically evaluate the function of tip domains truncated to different lengths . Many truncated variants performed well , especially on BW25113\u0394rfaG , which included some with FN\u00a0\u2265\u00a010 ( Figure 4\u2014source data 2 ) . Truncated variants that performed well are distributed throughout the tip domain and are not localized to any one region ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 5 ) . We clonally tested variant R525* , the best performing truncated library member ( BW25113\u0394rfaG FN\u00a0=\u00a09 . 55 , BW25113\u0394rfaD FN\u00a0=\u00a075 . 7 ) , and found that this mutant showed no ability to plaque on any host unless provided the tail fiber in trans . These truncated phages , detectable here only using deep sequencing , may demonstrate how obligate lytic phages could become less active in a bacterial population , slowly replicating alongside their bacterial hosts , requiring only a single mutation to become fully active again . In fact , acceptor phages altogether lacking a tail fiber were present at extremely low abundance ( Figure 4\u2014source data 1 ) . These phages are not artifacts from library creation as some ability to replicate is required to produce detectable concentrations of each phage . We concluded that these are viable phage variants albeit with a much slower infection cycle , resulting in their inability to form visible plaques . Phage therapy is emerging as a promising solution to the antibiotic resistance crisis . Recent clinical success stories against multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter and Mycobacterium showcase the enormous potential of phage therapy ( Dedrick et al . , 2019; Schooley et al . , 2017 ) . Despite notable exceptions , in general development of effective phage-based therapeutics is hindered by onset of bacterial resistance , resulting in low phage susceptibility . Although initial application of phages in a laboratory setting may reduce bacterial levels , the residual bacterial load remains high , causing bacteria to quickly recover after phage application ( Fister et al . , 2016; Huss and Raman , 2020; Silva et al . , 2014 ) . A high ratio of phage to bacteria ( multiplicity of infection [MOI] ) may productively kill bacteria in a laboratory setting by overwhelming a host with many phages ( Abedon , 2011 ) . However , ensuring an overwhelming amount of phages in a clinical setting is not always feasible ( Principi et al . , 2019 ) . Engineering highly active phages that overcome bacterial insensitivity and can therefore productively eliminate bacterial populations at low MOI in a laboratory setting would greatly enhance phage-based therapeutics . We hypothesized that engineered tip domain variants may abate bacterial insensitivity and be active even at low MOI by better adsorbing to the native receptor or recognizing a new bacterial receptor altogether . To test this hypothesis , we chose pathogenic E . coli strain isolate 473 isolated from a patient with\u00a0a UTI ( Arthur et al . , 1990 ) . Although T7 can infect this UTI strain , insensitivity arises rapidly , a phenomenon all too common with the use of natural phages . EOP assays for wildtype T7 showed insensitive plaque morphology consisting of small , slow-growing plaques . No visible lysis was detected after overnight incubation when wildtype T7 was applied in liquid culture ( MOI\u00a0=\u00a01 ) , indicating onset of insensitivity . However , the variant library applied on the UTI strain cleared the culture ( MOI\u00a0=\u00a01 ) after overnight incubation , suggesting that\u00a0T7 variants are capable of lysing and attenuating insensitivity existing in the pool . We clonally characterized three variants ( N501H , D520A , and G521R ) isolated from plaques . All three variants vastly outperformed wildtype T7 in terms of onset of insensitivity . Insensitivity emerged approximately 11\u201313 hr after initial lysis for the three variants , whereas it took merely 1\u20132 hr after initial lysis for wildtype ( Figure 5A ) . In particular , the N501H variant lysed cells faster and produced a lower bacterial load post lysis , suggesting far greater activity compared to wildtype T7 . Next , we compared the effect of phage MOI ( MOI\u00a0=\u00a0102-10\u22125 ) on the lysing activity of N501H and wildtype T7 ( Figure 5B ) . At all MOIs , wildtype phages lysed UTI473 significantly more slowly compared to N501H phages ( all p\u00a0<\u00a00 . 05 ) . At lower MOI , time to lysis of N501H was half that of wildtype T7 , though they were more comparable at higher MOI . A striking contrast between N501H and wildtype T7 is evident in reduced bacterial insensitivity at progressively lower MOI ( Figure 5C ) . Between an MOI of 100 to 1 , application of both N501H and wildtype phage resulted in similar bacterial insensitivity . However , between an MOI of 10\u22121 and 10\u22125 , application of N501H phage reduced insensitivity over a 10 hr window , while application of wildtype phages resulted in rapid onset of insensitive bacteria . We postulate that at high MOI wildtype T7 simply overwhelms the host before insensitivity arises , while at lower MOI insensitivity can emerge and only variants adapted to the host can effectively kill the host . These results indicate that ORACLE can generate phage variants superior to wildtype phage that could then become starting points for further engineering therapeutic phages . Further experiments will be required to assess the in vivo efficacy of the T7 variants . Most phages are specialists that selectively target a narrow range of hosts but are unable to productively infect other closely related hosts ( Hyman and Abedon , 2010 ) . We wanted to assess differences in the host range of individual variants on 10G , BL21 , and BW25113 and identify variants with constricted host ranges . Ideally , host specificities can be determined by subjecting a co-culture of all three hosts to the phage library . However , deconvolving specificities of thousands of variants from a pooled co-culture experiment can be technically challenging . Instead , we sought to estimate specificities by comparing FN of a phage variant on all three hosts . Although FN compares activity of variants within a host , it could nonetheless be a useful proxy for estimating specificities across hosts . For instance , a phage variant with high FN on BL21 but completely depleted on BW25113 is more likely to specifically lyse BL21 than BW25113 in a co-culture experiment . Based on this rationale , we considered different metrics of comparison of FN and settled on difference in FN of a variant with reduced weight for enrichment ( or FD , see Materials and methods ) between any two hosts as an approximate measure of host preference . This metric is not an absolute measure of host specificity , but one devised to reveal broad trends in specificity to prioritize variants for downstream validation . To assess if variants preferred one host over another , we computed FD for all three pairwise combinations and plotted functional substitutions as points on or above/below a \u2018neutral\u2019 line ( Figure 6A\u2013C ) . Variants above the line favor lysis of the noted host , and vice versa for variants below the line . To check if this FD-based approach is suitable for assessing host specificity , we compared our results with previously published data . Two substitutions , D520Q and V544A , that were reported to have a preference for BW25113 and BL21 , respectively , in head-to-head comparisons ( Heineman et al . , 2008 ) were placed correctly in our plots , confirming the validity of our FD-based classification scheme . We identified 118 out of 1660 variants as good candidates for constricting host range ( |FD|\u00a0\u2265\u00a01 , see Figure 6\u2014source data 1 ) . Of the 118 variants , 53 variants favor BW25113 over BL21 and 98 variants favor BW25113 over 10G in pairwise comparisons ( Figure 6A , C ) . Between BL21 and 10G , there are 15 variants that favor BL21 but none that favor 10G ( Figure 6B ) . Certain key positions , including G479 , D540 , R542 , and D520 , which we previously identified as functionally important ( Figure 3A ) , are the molecular drivers of specificity between hosts ( Figure 6A\u2013C ) . Taken together , our data suggests that it would be easier to find a variant capable of specifically lysing BW25113 , less so for BL21 , and most challenging for 10G . To validate our analysis , we clonally tested variant R542Q , which had a greater preference for BW25113 than BL21 or 10G ( BW25113 FD\u00a0=\u00a02 . 0 , BL21 FD\u00a0=\u00a00 , 10G FD\u00a0=\u00a00 ) , and variant D540S , which had a greater preference for BL21 and 10G than BW25113 ( 10G FD\u00a0=\u00a01 . 03 , BL21 FD\u00a0=\u00a00 . 62 , BW25113 FD\u00a0=\u00a00 . 03 ) . Indeed , R542Q showed a significant\u00a0approximately\u00a0hundredfold decrease in the ability to plaque on BL21 compared to BW25113 while 10G plaques were atypically small , indicating a severe growth defect ( Figure 6D ) . In contrast , D540S showed a significant\u00a0approximately\u00a0hundredfold decrease in the ability to plaque on BW25113 compared to BL21 and 10G ( Figure 6D ) , confirming the host constriction properties of these variants . In summary , pairwise comparison is a powerful tool to map substitutions that constrict host range and can be leveraged to tailor engineered phages for targeted hosts . \n In this study , we used ORACLE to create a large , unbiased library of T7 phage variants to comprehensively characterize the mutational landscape of the tip domain of the tail fiber . Our study identified hundreds of novel function-enhancing substitutions that had not been previously characterized . We mapped regions of function-enhancing substitutions on to the crystal structure to rationalize how sequence and structure influence activity and host range . Several important insights emerged from these results . Cross-comparison between different hosts and selection on resistant hosts allowed us to map key substitutions , leading to host discrimination and gain of function . Single amino acid substitutions are sufficient to enhance activity and host range , including some that confer dramatic increases in activity or specificity . The functional landscape on each host is unique , reflecting both different molecular preferences of adsorption and the fitness of wildtype T7 on these hosts . For instance , hydrophilic substitutions were enriched in 10G while hydrophobic substitutions were enriched in BW25113 . Notably , substitutions on 10G ( an E . coli K-12 derivative lacking LPS components ) mirrored substitutions that recovered function on BW25113 mutants with truncated LPS , which shows convergence of selection . Function-enhancing substitutions were densely concentrated in the exterior loops , indicating an orientational preference for receptor recognition . However , they were also found on other surface residues , albeit less frequently , suggesting alternative binding modes of the tip domain for host recognition , and several intolerant residues were located in exterior loops . Taken together , these results highlight the extraordinary functional potential of the tip domain and rationalize the pervasive use of this structural fold in nature for molecular recognition . Comparison of these functional profiles precisely reveals the\u00a0regions that are ideal engineering targets for customizing host range and activity and identifies intolerant residues that should be avoided when engineering synthetic phages . These results also highlight the power of deep sequencing to detect and resolve small functional effects over traditional low-throughput plaque assays . This is best illustrated in the case of truncated variants visible only to deep sequencing , but incapable of plaque formation without a helper plasmid . The truncated variants are likely not experimental artifacts as some ability to replicate is required to survive multiple rounds of selection on the host . Truncation of the tip domain may misorient the phage relative to the receptor , likely resulting in slower growth and deficiency in plaquing , while still capable of replicating . Since plaque formation is a complex process , inability to plaque may not imply a functionally incompetent phage . ORACLE is designed as a foundational technology to elucidate sequence\u2013function relationships in phage genes . On T7 , ORACLE can be used to investigate the function of several important genes , including the remainder of the tail fiber and tail structure , capsid components , or lysins and holins . Together , these will provide a comprehensive view of the molecular determinants of the structure , function , and evolution of a phage . Once the phage variants are created , scaling up ORACLE to investigate potentially tens of hosts merely scales up sequencing volume , not experimental complexity . Such a large-scale study will lead to a detailed molecular understanding and adaptability of phage bacterial interactions . Any phage with a sequenced genome and a transformable host capable of maintaining a plasmid library should be amenable to ORACLE because the phage variants are created during the natural infection cycle . This approach can be leveraged to tune activity for known phages with high activity , such as T7 , or to identify engineering targets that dramatically increase activity for newly isolated natural phages . The confluence of genome engineering , high-throughput DNA synthesis , and sequencing enabled by ORACLE together with viral metagenomics could transform phage biology . Phages constitute unparalleled biological variation found in nature and are aptly called the \u2018dark matter\u2019 of the biosphere . Their sequence diversity and richness are coming to light in the growing volume of viral metagenome databases . However , what functions these sequences encode remains largely unknown . For instance , fecal viromes estimate 108\u2013109 virus-like particles per gram of feces , but less than a quarter of sequence reads align to existing databases ( Reyes et al . , 2012 ) . While this knowledge gap is daunting , it also presents an opportunity to mine metagenomic sequences to characterize their function and engineer programmable phages . By enabling sequence programmability , we envision ORACLE as a powerful tool to discover new phage \u2018parts\u2019 from metagenomic sequences . \n T7 bacteriophage was obtained from ATCC ( ATCC BAA-1025-B2 ) .

Phage template was initially treated at 65\u00b0C for 10 min ( for YAC cloning ) , but we later simply extended the 95\u00b0C denaturation step to 5 min ( for deep sequencing ) . DpnI digest was performed on all PCR that used plasmid as template . Digestion was performed directly on PCR product immediately before purification by combining 1\u20132 \u03bcl DpnI ( 20\u201340 units ) , 5 \u03bcl 10\u00d7 CutSmart Buffer , PCR product , and dH2O to 50 \u03bcl , incubating at 37\u00b0C for 2 hr then heat inactivating at 80\u00b0C for 20 min .

E . coli 10G competent cells were made by adding 8 ml overnight 10G cells to 192 ml SOC ( with antibiotics as necessary ) and incubating at 21\u00b0C and 200 rpm until ~OD600 of 0 . 4 as determined using an Agilent Cary 60 UV-Vis Spectrometer using manufacturer's documentation ( actual incubation time varies based on antibiotic , typically overnight ) .

Detailed protocols for cloning are available on request . All primers used in experiments in this publication are listed in supplementary file 1 . pHT7Helper1 contains a pBR backbone , kanamycin resistance cassette , mCherry , and the T7 tail fiber gp17 . Both mCherry and gp17 are under constitutive expression . Gp17 was combined with promoter apFAB47 ( Kosuri et al . , 2013 ) using SOE and the plasmid assembled by Gibson assembly . There is a single-nucleotide deletion in the promoter that has no effect on plaque recovery for phages that require gp17 to plaque . This plasmid is used during optimized recombination and accumulation in ORACLE to prevent library bias and depletion of variants that grow poorly on E . coli 10G . pHRec1 contains an SC101 backbone , Cre recombinase , a spectinomycin resistance cassette , and the T7 tail fiber gp17 flanked by Cre lox66 sites with an m2 spacer , a 3\u2032 pad region , and lox71 sites with a wt spacer ( Langer et al . , 2002; Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . Cre recombinase is under constitutive expression . This plasmid was assembled with sequential PCR and Gibson assembly . During assembly , we used PCR overhangs and SDM to create two synonymous substitutions in gp17 to remove two BsaI restriction sites , facilitating downstream Golden Gate Assembly . This plasmid was used in recombination assays as it allows for recombination of wildtype gp17 and is used as template to generate the DMS variant library . The DMS variant library is referred to as pHRec1-Lib and is used during optimized recombination in ORACLE . Note that\u00a0this assembly was not tolerated in higher copy number plasmids . pHCas9 contains an SC101 backbone , a spectinomycin resistance cassette , and cas9 cassette capable of ready BsaI cloning of gRNA ( Jiang et al . , 2013 ) . This plasmid is used directly as part of the negative control for the accumulation assay and has five derivatives , pHCas9-1 through -5 , each with a different gRNA targeting the fixed region in the T7 acceptor phage . pHCas9 was created with Gibson assembly , while derivatives were assembled by phosphorylation and annealing gRNA oligos ( 100 \u03bcM forward and reverse oligo , 5 \u03bcl T4 Ligase Buffer , 1 \u03bcl T4 PNK , to 50 \u03bcl dH2O , incubate at 37\u00b0C for 1 hr , 96\u00b0C for 6 min , then 0 . 1 \u00b0C/s temperature reduction to 23\u00b0C ) , then Golden Gate cloning ( 1 \u03bcl annealed oligo , 75 ng pHCas9 , 2 \u03bcl T4 DNA Ligase Buffer , 1 \u03bcl Golden Gate Enzyme Mix , dH2O to 20 \u03bcl ) , incubation at 37\u00b0C for 1 hr then 60\u00b0C for 5 min , followed by direct transformation of 1 \u03bcl , plated on Lb with spectinomycin . Note that\u00a0pHCas9-3 was the most inhibitory ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A ) and was the only plasmid used in accumulation during ORACLE . This assembly was also not tolerated in higher copy number plasmids . All plasmid backbones and gene fragments are lab stocks . Bacterial concentrations were determined by serial dilution of bacterial culture ( 1:10 or 1:100 dilutions made to 1 ml in 1 . 5 microcentrifuge tubes in Lb ) and subsequent plating and bead spreading of 100 \u03bcl of a countable dilution ( targeting 50 colony-forming units ) on Lb plates . Plates were incubated overnight and counted the next morning . Typically , 2\u20133 dilution series were performed for each host to initially establish concentration at different OD600 and subsequent concentrations were confirmed with a single dilution series for later experiments . Stationary phase cultures are created by growing bacteria overnight ( totaling\u00a0~20\u201330 hr of incubation ) at 37\u00b0C . Cultures are briefly vortexed , then used directly . Exponential phase culture consists of stationary culture diluted 1:20 in Lb , then incubated at 37\u00b0C until an OD600 of\u00a0~0 . 4\u20130 . 8 is reached ( as determined using an Agilent Cary 60 UV-Vis Spectrometer using manufacturer's documentation ) , typically taking 40 min to 1 hr and 20 min depending on the strain and antibiotic , after which cultures are briefly vortexed and used directly . Phage lysate was purified by centrifuging phage lysate at 16 g , then filtering supernatant through a 0 . 22 \u03bcM filter . Chloroform was not routinely used unless destruction of any remaining host was considered necessary and is mentioned in such cases . To establish titer , phage samples were typically serially diluted ( 1:10 or 1:100 dilutions made to 1 ml in 1 . 5 microcentrifuge tubes ) in Lb to a 10\u22128 dilution for preliminary titering by spot assay . Spot assays were performed by mixing 250 \u03bcl of relevant bacterial host in stationary phase with 3 . 5 ml of 0 . 5% top agar , briefly vortexing , then plating on Lb plates warmed to 37\u00b0C . After plates solidified ( typically\u00a0~5 min ) , 1 . 5 \u03bcl of each dilution of phage sample was spotted in series on the plate . Plates were incubated and checked at 2\u20134 hr and in some cases overnight ( ~20\u201330 hr ) to establish a preliminary titer . After a preliminary titer was established , phage samples were serially diluted in triplicate for EOP assays . EOP assays were performed using whole plates instead of spot plates to avoid inaccurate interpretation of results due to spotting error ( Khan Mirzaei and Nilsson , 2015 ) . To perform the whole plate EOP assay , 250 \u03bcl of bacterial host in stationary or exponential phase was mixed with between 5 and 50 \u03bcl of phages from a relevant dilution targeted to obtain 50 plaque-forming units ( PFUs ) after overnight incubation . The phage and host mixture was briefly vortexed , briefly centrifuged , then added to 3 . 5 ml of 0 . 5% top agar , which was again briefly vortexed and immediately plated on Lb plates warmed to 37\u00b0C . After plates solidified ( typically\u00a0~5 min ) , plates were inverted and incubated overnight . PFUs were typically counted at 4\u20136 hr and after overnight incubation ( ~20\u201330 hr ) , and the total overnight PFU count used to establish titer of the phage sample . PFU totals between 10 and 300 PFU were typically considered acceptable , otherwise plating was repeated for the same dilution series . This was repeated in triplicate for each phage sample on each relevant host to establish phage titer . EOP was determined using a reference host , typically E . coli 10G with pHT7Helper1 but stated if otherwise . EOP values were generated for each of the three dilutions by taking the phage titer on the test host divided by the phage titer on the reference host , and this value was subsequently log10 transformed . Values are reported as mean \u00b1 SD . MOI was calculated by dividing phage titer by bacterial concentration . MOI for the T7 variant library after the variant gene is expressed was estimated by titering on 10G with pHT7Helper1 . Limit of detection ( LOD ) for T7 acceptor phages ( T7 Acc ) and T7 lacking a tail fiber ( T7\u0394gp17 ) was established based on the ability of these phages to clear a bacterial lawn . These phages are unable to plaque on host lacking pHT7Helper1 , but phages do express a tail fiber due to being propagated on host with pHT7Helper1 . Functionally this allows these phages to complete one infection cycle and kill one host but does not allow the creation of plaque-viable progeny phages if that host does not also contain pHT7Helper1 . At an MOI of greater than\u00a0~2 , we noted plates no longer form lawns of bacteria but instead contain individual colonies or are clear , reflective of these singular assassinations . As expected , this effect occurs at different concentrations of phages for exponential or stationary host due to different host concentration at those stages of growth . As plaques cannot form under these conditions and these infections are not productive beyond a single infection , we simply used this cutoff as the LOD for this assay . Growth time courses for UTI473 ( Figure 5 ) and OD600were performed using a Synergy HTX Multi-Mode 96-well plate reader , using 140 \u03bcl of host and 10 \u03bcl of relevant phage titers . Phages were applied after an hour of incubation in the plate reader . To establish recombination rate ( Figure 1C ) , we passaged T7 acceptor phages on 5 ml exponential phase E . coli 10G containing pHT7Helper1 and pHRec1 . pHRec1 was used because the recombined gp17 tail fiber is wildtype , ensuring every recombined phage is plaque-capable ( derived from Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2B results ) . We sought to evaluate recombination rate after only one passage through the host to avoid misinterpretation of results in case recombined phages had different fitness than unrecombined phages . We used an MOI of 10 and allowed passage for 30 min , sufficient time for one wildtype phage passage , after which we halted any remaining reactions by adding 200 \u03bcl of chloroform and lysing the remaining bacterial host . Phages were then purified to acquire the final phage population . We established the phage population titer on 10G and 10G with pHT7Helper1 . Both acceptor phages and recombined phages are capable of plaquing on 10G with pHT7Helper1 , and this phage titer is used to count the total phage population . Only recombined phages are capable of plaquing on 10G , and this titer is used to count recombined phages . Recombination rate was established as the fraction titer of recombined phages divided by recombined phages . This was repeated in triplicate and reported as mean \u00b1 SD . To create the DMS variant plasmid library , oligos were first designed and ordered from Agilent as a SurePrint Oligonucleotide Library ( product G7220A , OLS 131-150mers ) . Every oligo contained a single substitution at a single position in the tip domain , overall including all non-synonymous substitutions , a single synonymous substitution , and a stop codon from position 472\u2013554 . Note that\u00a0we did mutate the stop codon , which is position 554 , that when substituted results in a three amino acid extension ( -DAR ) of gp17 . We used the most frequently found codon for each amino acid in the gp17 tail fiber to define the codon for each substitution . Oligos contained BsaI sites at each end to facilitate Golden Gate cloning . To accommodate a shorter oligo length , the library was split into three pools covering the whole tip domain . Oligo pools were amplified by PCR using 0 . 005 pmol total oligo pool as template and 15 total cycles to prevent PCR bias , then pools were purified . pHRec1 was used as template in a PCR reaction to create three backbones for each of the three pools . Backbones were treated with BsaI and Antarctic Phosphatase as follows . A\u00a05 \u03bcl 10\u00d7 CutSmart , 2 \u03bcl BsaI , ~1177 ng backbone , dH2O to 50 \u03bcl was mixed and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 2 hr , after which 1 \u03bcl additional BsaI , 2 \u03bcl Antarctic Phosphatase , 5 . 89 \u03bcl 10\u00d7 Antarctic Phosphatase buffer was spiked into reaction . Reaction was incubated for one more hour at 37\u00b0C , then enzymes were heat inactivated at 65\u00b0C for 20 min ( concentration\u00a0~20 ng/\u03bcl at this point ) and used directly ( no purification ) in Golden Gate Assembly . Golden Gate\u00a0Assembly was performed using\u00a0~100 ng of relevant pool backbone and a 2\u00d7 molar ratio for oligos ( ~10 ng ) , combined with 2 \u03bcl 10\u00d7 T4 DNA ligase buffer , 1 \u03bcl NEB Golden Gate Enzyme Mix , and dH2O to 20 \u00b5l . These reactions were cycled from 37\u00b0C to 16\u00b0C over 5 min , 30\u00d7 , then held at 60\u00b0C for 5 min to complete Golden Gate\u00a0Assembly . Membrane drop dialysis was then performed on each library pool for 75 min to enhance transformation efficiency . Then , 2 \u03bcl of each pool was transformed into 33 \u03bcl competent E . coli 10-beta ( NEB C3020 ) cells . Drop plates were made at this point ( spotting 2 . 5 \u03bcl of dilutions of each library on Lb plates with spectinomycin ) , and total actual transformed cells were estimated at\u00a0~2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0105 CFU/ml . Each 1 ml pool was added to 4 ml Lb with spectinomycin and incubated overnight , then plasmids were purified . Plasmids concentration was determined by nanodrop and pools were then combined at an equimolar ratio to create the final phage variant pool , denoted as pHRec1-Lib . pHRec1-Lib was transformed into E . coli 10G with pHT7Helper1 . Drop plates were made ( spotting 2 . 5 \u03bcl of dilutions of each library onto Lb plates with spectinomycin and kanamycin ) and total actual transformed cells were also estimated at\u00a0~2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0105 CFU/ml . The 1 ml library was added to 4 ml Lb with spectinomycin and kanamycin and incubated overnight . This host , E . coli 10G with pHT7Helper1 and pHRec1-Lib , was the host used for Optimized Recombination during ORACLE . Acceptor phages were assembled using YAC rebooting ( Ando et al . , 2015; Jaschke et al . , 2012 ) , which requires yeast transformation of relevant DNA segments , created as follows . A prs415 yeast centromere plasmid was split into three segments by PCR , separating the centromere and leucine selection marker , which partially limits recircularization and improved assembly efficiency ( Kuijpers et al . , 2013 ) . Wildtype T7 segments were made by PCR using wildtype T7 as template . At the site of recombination , the acceptor phage contains , in order , lox71 sites with an m2 spacer ( Langer et al . , 2002 ) to facilitate one-way recombinase-mediated cassette exchange ( RMCE ) , a fixed sequence that was derived from sfGFP with a nonsense mutation , a short region mimicking gp17 to allow detection of acceptor phages by deep sequencing ( 5\u2032 NGS in Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1 ) , a 3\u2032 \u2018pad\u2019 to facilitate deep sequencing , and lox66 sites with a wt spacer ( see Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . This entire region was turned into one DNA segment by serial SOE reactions . Method note: Reversible or two-way RMCE using wildtype loxP sites could feasibly increase recombination efficiency as one-way RMCE is not necessarily required for ORACLE . Method note: PCR , including PCR for deep sequencing , behaved inconsistently at lox sites . We theorize that\u00a0this may be because these sites are inverted repeats . Our inclusion of the 3\u2032 \u2018pad\u2019 region corrected this problem and facilitated acceptor phage detection by deep sequencing . DNA parts were combined together ( 0 . 1 pmol/segment ) and transformed into S . cerevisiae BY4741 using a high-efficiency yeast transformation protocol ( Gietz and Woods , 2002 ) using SD-Leu selection . After 2\u20133 days , colonies were picked and directly assayed by multiplex colony PCR to assay assembly . Multiplex PCR interrogated junctions in the YAC construct and was an effective way of distinguishing correctly assembled YACs . Correctly assembled YACs were purified and transformed into E . coli 10G cells containing pHT7Helper1 , and after recovery 400 \u03bcl was used to inoculate 4 . 6 ml Lb . This culture was incubated until lysis , after which phages were purified to create the acceptor phage stock . Recombination was performed by adding T7 acceptor phages ( MOI\u00a0~\u00a05 ) to 15 ml exponential phase 10G with pHT7Helper1 and pHRec1-Lib ( shown as the donor plasmid in Figure 1 ) , split across three 5 ml cultures . A high MOI is used to allow for one effective infection cycle . Cultures were incubated until lysis ( ~30 min ) . Lysed cultures were combined and purified . This phage population constitutes the initial recombined phage population and contained an estimated 2 \u00d7 107 variants/ml in a total phage population of\u00a0~2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01010 PFU/ml . The remainder of the phages are acceptor phages . A schematic of the recombination is shown in Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1 . Note that\u00a0pHT7Helper1 ensures progeny should remain viable by providing gp17 in trans . Accumulation was performed by adding ~MOI of 0 . 2 of recombined phages ( 50 \u03bcl or\u00a0~1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0109 total phages ) to 5 ml of stationary phase E . coli 10G with pHT7Helper1 and pHCas9-3 resuspended in fresh Lb with kanamycin and spectinomycin . Cultures are incubated until lysis ( ~3 . 5 hr ) , then phages are purified . This MOI was chosen to target 1% of acceptor phages remaining in the final population as an internal control \u2013 the remainder of the phage population is accumulated variant phages . Stationary phase was used because it was more inhibitory based on EOP ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A ) . Note that\u00a0pHT7Helper1 still ensures progeny should remain viable by providing gp17 in trans and progeny from accumulation do not fully express variant genes . Method note: During ORACLE , the library gene is not actively repressed and some fraction of progeny phages are likely assembled with the variant gene or contain chimeric tail fibers with both proteins . This may account for some degree of the skew we see during accumulation , although skewed residues were not consistent with enrichment patterns on 10G . Here , this skew was not significant , but this could be an influencing factor in future studies . The bias can feasibly be further reduced by a number of methods of varying complexity , including repressing the genomic variant , increasing the amount of wildtype provided in trans , or simply reducing the number of replication events during ORACLE . Method note: See Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A for inhibition results for versions of pHCas9 . When sequenced , individual plaques after selection had mutations in the region targeted by each gRNA , as expected for how resistance to Cas9 occurs . Note that\u00a0acceptor phages are not actively destroyed but are rather inhibited and maintained at the same concentration . Selection may be improved by using multiple guide RNAs or using sgRNA platforms . Library expression was performed by adding the accumulated DMS library to 5 ml E . coli 10G ( with no plasmid ) at an MOI of\u00a0~1 . Cultures are incubated for 30 min , then 200 \u03bcl chloroform is added to the culture to lyse any remaining cells and phages are purified . This constitutes the final phage variant library with full expression of the variant gp17 tail fibers . This phage population is directly sequenced to establish the pre-selection library population . Method note: This MOI and culture conditions are chosen to prevent phages from undergoing more than one replication cycle . Additional replication cycles would result in skew toward variants that grow better on the host used for expression . At an MOI of 1 , progeny from the first replication cycle already comprise the majority of the possible concentration of phages for T7 . Chloroform is added at 30 min to halt any rogue second infections in process . Method note: Two points bear additional mention regarding ORACLE as a whole to create variant libraries . First , the importance of retaining variants that do not grow well on the host used to create the library cannot be overstated . These variants are critical for mapping functional regions . For example , we used 10G to grow our library , which happened to have the most significant selection of the susceptible hosts and had depletion of many functional regions . The resolution of this assay would have been deeply impacting if these variants had been lost . Second , due to possible depletion and skew , it is critical to assay library distribution after insertion and expression of the variants in the phage instead of , for example , assaying distribution in plasmid before phage insertion . While ORACLE is designed to avoid this problem , any selection that occurs during library construction needs to be identified prior to selection experiments . All DMS selection results , besides single-infection cycle experiments on resistant hosts noted later , were performed in the same way . The T7 variant library was added to 5 ml of exponential host at an MOI of\u00a0~10\u22122 , and the culture was allowed to fully lyse ( typically 40\u201380 min depending on the host ) . Phage lysate was purified and then the titer established for the host the phage was being selected on . This process was then repeated using the selected phage lysate . An MOI of 10\u22122 was chosen to allow phages that grow slower a chance to replicate . For reference under these conditions , we expect wildtype to complete four infection cycles on a susceptible host . Phage lysate from the second selection was retained and used as template for deep sequencing to establish the post-selection phage population . The entire process was repeated in biological triplicate for each host . Single-infection cycle results cited in Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 4 and Figure 4\u2014source data 1 and 2 were performed on BW25113\u0394rfaG and BW25113\u0394rfaD using an MOI of\u00a0~1 , then waiting for the culture to fully lyse , after which phage lysate was purified and sequenced directly . Method note: The number of infection cycles should be carefully considered due to the effect of multiple exponential replication events on the phage population . As noted in the text , we expected less consistency as we increased infection cycles , especially on severely bottlenecked populations as seen on BW25113\u0394rfaD , but additional infection cycles allow for increased competition between productive members . We used deep sequencing to evaluate phage populations . We first amplified the tip domain by two-step PCR , or tailed amplicon sequencing , using KAPA HiFi . Primers for deep sequencing attach to constant regions adjacent to the tip domain ( the target region is 304 bp total , between the 5\u2032 NGS region and 3\u2032 pad on Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . Constant regions are also installed in the fixed region of the acceptor phages for the same-size amplicon , so acceptor phages can also be detected . The first PCR reaction adds an internal barcode ( used for technical replicates to assay PCR skew ) , a variable N region ( to assist with nucleotide diversity during deep sequencing , this is essential for DMS libraries due to low nucleotide diversity at each position ) , and the universal Illumina adapter . Undiluted phages are used as template . Four forward and four reverse primers were used in each reaction , each with a variable N count ( 0 , 2 , 4 , or 8 ) . Primers were mixed at equimolar ratios , and total primers used was per recommended primer concentration . PCR was performed using 12 total cycles in the first PCR reaction , then the product of this reaction was purified . The second PCR reaction adds an index and the Illumina \u2018stem\u2019 . Then , 1 \u03bcl of purified product from the first reaction was used as template using eight total PCR cycles . The product of this reaction was purified and used directly for deep sequencing . Each phage population was sampled at least twice using separate internal barcodes , and no PCR reactions were pooled . Total PCR cycles overall for each sample were kept at 20\u00d7 to avoid PCR skew . All phage samples were deep sequenced using an Illumina MiSeq System , 2 \u00d7 250 read length using MiSeq Reagent Kit v2 or v2 Nano according to manufacturer's documentation . Paired-end Illumina sequencing reads were merged with FLASH ( Fast Length Adjustment of SHort reads ) using the default software parameters ( Edgar and Flyvbjerg , 2015 ) . Phred quality scores ( Q scores ) were used to compute the total number of expected errors ( E ) for each merged read , and reads exceeding an Emax of 1 were removed ( Mago\u010d and Salzberg , 2011 ) . Wildtype , acceptor phages , and each variant were then counted in the deep sequencing output . We correlated read counts for each technical replicate to determine if there was any notable skew from PCR or deep sequencing . Replicates correlated extremely well ( R\u00a0\u2265\u00a00 . 98 for all samples ) , indicating no relevant PCR skew . Besides wildtype and acceptor counts , we included only sequences with single substitutions in our analysis . While this limited the scope of the analysis , it greatly reduced the possibility of deep sequencing error , resulting in an incorrect read count for a variant , as virtually every relevant error would result in at least a double substitution in our library . With this in mind and to avoid missing low abundance members after selection , we simply used a low read cutoff of 2 and did not utilize a pseudo-count of 1 for each position . Of the 1660 variants , 3 ( S487P , L524M , and R542N ) fell below our LOD in the variant pool before selection . These positions were excluded from analysis as a pre-selection population could not be accurately determined , although both S487P and L542M subsequently emerged in several post-selection populations , indicating that\u00a0they were present below the LOD . Technical replicates of each biological replicate were aggregated and each biological replicate was correlated to determine reproducibility , reported for each relevant figure as a figure supplement . Possible outliers were identified by data sorting , and lower correlation in 10G was noted to primarily be a result of differences in enrichment of several polar , uncharged substitutions and proline substitutions in the first biological replicate . These substitutions are proximally located near exterior loop HI and may indicate an unknown variable or growth condition in the first replicate that produces a slightly different enrichment pattern . Correlation was otherwise robust , and excluding only G479Q produces R\u00a0=\u00a00 . 94 , 0 . 95 , and 0 . 99 as displayed in Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1 . Positively charged , downward-facing substitutions were universally enriched in BW25113\u0394rfaD , but correlation was reduced due to inconsistencies in which particular substitutions were the most enriched in a given replicate . While the same substitutions were enriched in all three replicates , suggesting reproducibility of results , the scale of enrichment varied considerably . Correlation was otherwise robust , and\u00a0excluding the single most enriched substitution of each replicate ( G521R , A500R , and G521H ) produces R\u00a0=\u00a00 . 90 , 0 . 93 , and 0 . 86 as displayed . Method note: BW25113\u0394rfaD is the most resistant host by EOP , and we hypothesize that\u00a0these inconsistencies in FN may arise due to\u00a0severe loss of diversity , \u2018bottlenecking\u2019 the population , and causing stochastic differences in enrichment to become magnified with multiple rounds of selection across independent experiments . Future work with very resistant hosts may benefit from fewer rounds of selection to prevent significant stochastic divergence . Single-infection cycles are more consistent but provide fewer cycles for variants to directly compete with one another , as noted in methods for DMS selection . To score enrichment for each variant , we used a basic functional score ( F ) , averaging results of the three biological replicates , where F=x\u00afVariant%Post\u2212PassageVariant%Pre\u2212Passage . To compare variant performance across hosts , we normalized functional score ( FN ) to wildtype , where FN=x\u00afVariant%Post\u2212PassageVariant%Pre\u2212Passage/WT%Post\u2212PassageWT%Pre\u2212Passage . To define variant behavior on E . coli 10G , BL21 , and BW25113 , we considered variants depleted if FN was below 0 . 1 ( i . e . , performed 10 times worse than wildtype ) , tolerated if between 0 . 1 and 2 , and enriched if above 2 ( i . e . , performed twice as good as wildtype ) ( Figure 2 ) . As wildtype T7 effectively grows on all three hosts , we reasoned that it would be more challenging for an enriched mutant to surpass wildtype than it would be for a mutant to become depleted . These cutoffs were supported based on preliminary plaque assay results and the extent of standard deviation across biological replicates . For BW25113\u0394rfaD and BW25113\u0394rfaG , we further defined significantly enriched variants as performing at least 10 times better ( FN\u00a0\u226510 ) than wildtype because wildtype does not grow effectively on these strains ( Figure 4 ) . We compared variant FN across 10G , BL21 , and BW25113 to further characterize each variant and find functional variants ( Figure 3 ) . We sought to identify variants that had meaningfully different performance on different hosts , which would be strong evidence that either the wildtype residue or the variant substitution was important in a host-specific context . In addition to providing direct insight intro structure\u2013function relationships , such substitutions or positions are ideal engineering targets for altering host range or increasing activity in engineered phages . We considered substitutions that were depleted ( FN\u00a0<\u00a00 . 1 ) on all three hosts to be intolerant , while substitutions that were tolerated or enriched ( FN\u00a0\u2265\u00a00 . 1 ) in all three hosts to be generally tolerated . Substitutions that were depleted on one host but tolerated or enriched on another were considered functional . To broadly characterize each position , we counted the number of substitutions at that position that fell into each category , and colored positions ( Figure 3C ) as functional if over 33% of substitutions at that position were functional , intolerant if over 50% of substitutions were intolerant , and tolerant otherwise . We found these cutoffs to effectively group residues of interest , although we note that\u00a0there remain substitutions that could be tolerant and relevant in different contexts or intolerant for these three hosts but not others . For defining ideal host constriction mutants ( Figure 6 ) , we first constricted FN values that were greater than 1 to reduce the impact of higher scores on this comparison . Specifically we generated functional difference ( FD ) , where if FN<1 , FD=FN , and where FN\u22651 , FD=FN\u22121max ( Strain\u00a0FN ) \u22121+1 . FD thus ranged from 0 to 2 for each substitution , where scores above 1 are normalized to the maximum value for that host and fall between 1 and 2 , minimizing but not eliminating weight for enrichment . We reasoned that for the purposes of finding host constriction mutants the extent of enrichment for a substitution is less relevant than if that substitution did poorly on another host . Put another way , it does not matter if a substitution is tolerated or enriched so long as it is depleted on a different host . For example , V544R has an FN of 9 . 09 in E . coli 10G but 0 . 07 in E . coli BW25113 , while G479E has an FN of 1 . 73 in E . coli 10G and falls below the LOD for E . coli BW25113 . For host constriction , both positions should be scored highly as the mutations can be tolerated or enriched in one host but are depleted in another . In contrast , A500H has an FN of 7 . 46 in E . coli 10G and 1 . 2 in E . coli BW25113 . While FN differs significantly and the substitution is enriched on one host , it is still tolerated in the other host and thus makes a poor host constriction target . After generating FD , we simply subtracted the substitution\u2019s FD on one host from the other in a pairwise comparison ( Figure 6 ) . Substitutions for host range constriction were considered ideal candidates if |FD|\u00a0\u2265\u00a01 . Variants with individual substitutions tested for EOP ( Figures 4\u20136 ) were either picked from plaques or created using SDM on pHRec1 , which was used to create the variant using ORACLE . The crystal structure of the gp17 tip domain was obtained ( PDB ID: 4A0T ) and water molecules removed before calculations run . All modeling calculations were performed using the Rosetta molecular modeling suite v3 . 9 . Substitutions were generated using the standard ddg_monomer application ( Kellogg et al . , 2011 ) to enable local conformational to minimize energy . For comparison to FD ( Figure S5 ) , a \u0394\u0394G of 10 or greater was considered destabilizing and \u0394\u0394G values between 10 and 30 were transformed to values between 0 and 1 , with any \u0394\u0394G greater than 30 set to 1 . \u0394\u0394G values below 10 were transformed to values between 0 and \u22121 based on a range to \u22129 . 29 , the most stabilizing \u0394\u0394G value calculated . We calculated FD for this plot using the maximum FD value from E . coli 10G , BL21 , or BW25113 . The maximum was used because any substitution that has a high FD on any host was theorized to require a stable protein . Positions considered destabilizing ( right side ) are expected to have a very low maximum FD , whereas stabilizing positions ( left side ) may have a low or high FD based on tolerance of the substitution . Positions that were tolerated or functional that Rosetta predicted to be unstable on the right of the plot may be due to errors in stability calculations or actual structural distortions that are either smaller perturbations that do\u00a0not affect fitness or are accommodated by quaternary arrangement . Alternatively , structural instability could be beneficial in some cases , allowing for enhanced receptor binding by , for example , exposing critical residues . To compare physicochemical properties for E . coli 10G , BL21 , and BW25113 , we binned depleted ( FN\u00a0\u2264\u00a00 . 1 ) , tolerated ( FN\u00a0>\u00a00 . 1 and\u00a0<2 ) , or enriched ( FN\u00a0\u2265\u00a02 ) substitutions and derived the change in mass , hydrophilicity , and hydrophobicity for each substitution ( Li et al . , 2016 ) . For BW25113\u0394rfaG and BW25113\u0394rfaD , we binned using an FN of 10 for the cutoff for enrichment instead . Packages ggplot2 and ggpubr in R were then used to compare the means of the three groups using a Kruskal\u2013Wallis test ( Hollander and Wolfe , 1973 ) , while subsequent pairwise comparisons were made using a Wilcoxon test ( Bauer , 1972 ) . Effect size ( r ) was calculated and can be summarized as r = abs ( zscore ) /sqrt ( n ) , where n is the total number of observations among the two groups . Alluvial plots ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2 , Figure 4 ) and Figure 2F parallel plot were generated with RawGraphs . Violin plots for physicochemical properties are output from R . Significance for FN values in Figure 2\u2014source data 2 and Figure 4\u2014source data 2 was defined as an average FN two or more standard deviations from wildtype or below the LOD in all biological replicates . p-Values for EOP graphs compare plaque capability on the tested host to the reference host for the EOP graph . Hierarchical clustering in Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3 is performed in R using heatmap . 2 without scaling . p-Values to compare functional data and EOP measurements were performed using two-tailed t-tests where values below the LOD were considered as the LOD . All other calculations and plots were made in Excel . Relevant statistical details of experiments can be found in the corresponding figure legends or relevant methods section .

{"lay_summary": "Spoken language is colored by fluctuations in pitch and rhythm . Rather than speaking in a flat monotone , we allow our sentences to rise and fall . We vary the length of syllables , drawing out some , and shortening others . These fluctuations , known as prosody , add emotion to speech and denote punctuation . In written language , we use a comma or a period to signal a boundary between phrases . In speech , we use changes in pitch \u2013 how deep or sharp a voice sounds \u2013 or in the length of syllables . Having more than one type of cue that can signal emotion or transitions between sentences has a number of advantages . It means that people can understand each other even when factors such as background noise obscure one set of cues . It also means that people with impaired sound perception can still understand speech . Those with a condition called congenital amusia , for example , struggle to perceive pitch , but they can compensate for this difficulty by placing greater emphasis on other aspects of speech . Jasmin et al . showed how the brain achieves this by comparing the brain activities of people with and without amusia . Participants were asked to read sentences on a screen where a comma indicated a boundary between two phrases . They then heard two spoken sentences , and had to choose the one that matched the written sentence . The spoken sentences used changes in pitch and/or syllable duration to signal the position of the comma . This provided listeners with the information needed to distinguish between \"after John runs the race , . . . \" and \"after John runs , the race . . . \" , for example . When two brain regions communicate , they tend to increase their activity at around the same time . The brain regions are then said to show functional connectivity . Jasmin et al . found that compared to healthy volunteers , people with amusia showed less functional connectivity between left hemisphere brain regions that process language and right hemisphere regions that process pitch . In other words , because pitch is a less reliable source of information for people with amusia , they recruit pitch-related brain regions less when processing speech . These results add to our understanding of how brains compensate for impaired perception . This may be useful for understanding the neural basis of compensation in other clinical conditions . It could also help us design bespoke hearing aids or other communication devices , such as computer programs that convert text into speech . Such programs could tailor the pitch and rhythm characteristics of the speech they produce to suit the perception of individual users .", "article": "Individuals with congenital amusia have a lifelong history of unreliable pitch processing . Accordingly , they downweight pitch cues during speech perception and instead rely on other dimensions such as duration . We investigated the neural basis for this strategy . During fMRI , individuals with amusia ( N = 15 ) and controls ( N = 15 ) read sentences where a comma indicated a grammatical phrase boundary . They then heard two sentences spoken that differed only in pitch and/or duration cues and selected the best match for the written sentence . Prominent reductions in functional connectivity were detected in the amusia group between left prefrontal language-related regions and right hemisphere pitch-related regions , which reflected the between-group differences in cue weights in the same groups of listeners . Connectivity differences between these regions were not present during a control task . Our results indicate that the reliability of perceptual dimensions is linked with functional connectivity between frontal and perceptual regions and suggest a compensatory mechanism . \n Congenital amusia is a rare condition characterized by impaired perception of and memory for pitch ( Peretz et al . , 2002 ) . Although congenital amusia presents as an auditory condition , auditory cortical responses are normal ( Moreau et al . , 2013; Norman-Haignere et al . , 2016 ) , as is subcortical encoding of pitch ( Liu et al . , 2015b ) . The dominant view of amusia\u2019s neural basis is that connectivity between right inferior frontal cortex and right auditory cortex is impaired , resulting in impaired conscious access to pitch information for guiding behavior ( Hyde et al . , 2011; Albouy et al . , 2013; Leveque et al . , 2016; Zendel et al . , 2015; see Peretz , 2016 for review ) . While congenital amusia is believed to be innate , there is evidence that recovery is possible through training ( Whiteford and Oxenham , 2018 ) . Although pitch is usually associated with music , it is also important for cueing categories in spoken language ( de Pijper and Sanderman , 1994; Streeter , 1978 ) and conveying emotion in speech ( Frick , 1985 ) . In highly controlled laboratory tasks in which speech perception judgments must be made based on pitch alone , only minor deficits have been observed in amusia ( Liu et al . , 2015a; Patel et al . , 2008 ) . In naturalistic speech perception contexts , people with amusia rarely report any difficulties ( Liu et al . , 2010 ) . This may be because , in natural speech , pitch variation tends to co-occur with variation in other acoustic dimensions , such as duration and amplitude . Our lab has shown that in such cases where multiple redundant cues are available , English-speaking individuals with amusia tend to rely less on pitch than non-amusic controls , suggesting they may calibrate their perception by down-weighting the cues that are less reliable for them ( Jasmin et al . , 2020a ) . As for emotional prosody in speech , individuals with amusia can recognize emotions in spoken sentences , but not in short samples such as isolated vowels ( Pralus et al . , 2019 ) , or when speech has been filtered to remove high-frequency non-pitch cues ( Lolli et al . , 2015 ) . It is unknown how decreased reliance on a particular acoustic cue during speech perception ( such as pitch cues in amusia ) is reflected in the brain . Previous neural studies of cue integration have focused on integration of multiple modalities , for\u00a0example the \u2018weighted connections\u2019 model of multisensory integration . In this model , the relative reliability of the modalities involved with perception of a stimulus is related to differential connectivity strength ( Beauchamp et al . , 2010; Rohe and Noppeney , 2018 ) . For example , when participants simultaneously view and feel touches to the hand , and reliability of visual and tactile perception is manipulated experimentally via introduction of noise , connection strength ( effective connectivity measured with functional MRI and structural equation modeling ) between unimodal and multimodal sensory areas adjusts accordingly . More concretely , when visual information is degraded , the connection strength between lateral occipital cortex ( a visual area ) and intraparietal sulcus ( a multimodal area ) decreases , and when tactile perception is made noisier , connection strength between secondary somatosensory cortex and intraparietal sulcus becomes weaker ( Beauchamp et al . , 2010 ) . Similarly , effective connectivity between the ( multimodal ) superior temporal sulcus ( STS ) and visual and auditory areas has shown similar modulations during processing of audiovisual speech: connection strength between auditory cortex and the STS is weaker when noise has been introduced to the auditory speech , and conversely connection strength between visual cortex and STS is weaker if visual noise is introduced ( Nath and Beauchamp , 2011 ) . Just as connectivity differences have been shown to reflect the precision of different sensory modalities during multisensory integration , an analogous phenomenon may be at work within a single modality during multidimensional integration . As mentioned , the acoustic speech signal carries multiple co-occurring acoustic dimensions ( e . g . roughly described as voice pitch , duration , and amplitude ) , which often provide redundant cues to disambiguate a linguistic category ( Patel , 2014; Winter , 2014; Jasmin et al . , 2020a ) . Individuals with typical pitch perception have learned through a lifetime of experience with speech acoustics that vocal pitch is a useful and reliable cue . By contrast , individuals with amusia , who have unreliable perception of and memory for pitch ( analogous to the \u2018noise\u2019 introduced in the multisensory integration studies cited above ) , would have learned that , for them , pitch is not a reliable cue for processing spoken language . Thus , by analogy to the multisensory weighting results described above , we hypothesize that amusics may exhibit decreased connectivity between language regions and pitch-related areas during speech processing . The neural foundations of perceptual weighting in speech have thus far not been investigated in atypical individuals . Indeed , only one previous functional neuroimaging study has examined the neural processing of spoken material in people with amusia . In this study , no group differences were detected in task-related activation or functional connectivity during processing of speech ( whereas group differences were observed during processing of tones; Albouy et al . , 2019 ) . However , the connectivity analyses in this study focused on the silent retention interval in a task in which participants needed to maintain phonemic and not pitch-related information in memory; the analyses also used broader bilateral ROIs within networks associated with language processing . It remains an open question how functional connectivity in amusic and non-amusic participants may differ during speech encoding in pitch-related language tasks within regions of interest selected with a whole-brain data-driven approach . To determine whether the relative reliability of auditory dimensions in speech perception is reflected in functional connectivity , we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to scan 15 individuals with amusia and 15 controls . Participants matched spoken sentences with visually presented ones on the basis of the position of intonational phrase boundaries . These intonation changes were conveyed differently , in three conditions: Pitch-Informative ( where only pitch cues could be used to make the judgment ) , Duration-Informative ( where only duration cues could be used ) or Both-Informative ( both pitch and duration cues could be used; Jasmin et al . , 2020a; Jasmin et al . , 2020b ) . Functional connectivity was then examined using a data-driven approach that allowed us to identify the largest group differences , without the need for regions of interest to be selected a priori . The benefit of this approach is that any set of regions could emerge , not only ones reported in previous literature . Crucially , task performance was matched between the groups ( based on prior behavioural testing; Jasmin et al . , 2020a ) , ensuring that any neural differences did not simply represent an inability to perform the task . Finally , functional connectivity between these areas was analyzed with respect to prosodic cue weights obtained outside the scanner , and also compared to functional connectivity calculated from different scanning runs with a passive listening task . \n On each trial , participants read one visually presented text sentence , then heard two auditory versions of the sentence , only one of which contained an acoustically conveyed phrase boundary in the same place as in the text sentence ( see Figure 1 for schematic and example sentences ) . Trials were scored as correct if a participant pressed the button associated with the auditory sentence that correctly matched the text sentence . Proportions of correct judgments ( Figure 2 ) were subjected to a repeated-measures analysis of variance . Overall , proportion correct across amusia and control groups was matched ( main effect of Group , F ( 1 , 84 ) = 0 . 16 , p=0 . 69 , interaction of Group by Condition , F ( 2 , 84 ) = 0 . 374 , p=0 . 96 ) . This lack of interaction was predicted based on previous results obtained from a similar paradigm using out-of-scanner data but from the same participants ( Jasmin et al . , 2020a ) . There was a main effect of condition ( F ( 2 , 84 ) = 3 . 32 , p=0 . 04 ) . Follow-up post-hoc testing indicated that performance in the Both-Informative condition ( with pitch and duration cues simultaneously present ) was more accurate than either Pitch-Informative ( t ( 84 ) = 2 . 31 , p=0 . 023 ) or Duration-Informative ( t ( 84 ) = 2 . 15 , p=0 . 03 ) , a result that was also predicted and which replicates the behavioral findings in Jasmin et al . , 2020a . One outlier control participant\u2019s performance was less than 0 . 3 . Re-analysis of the data without this participant did not change the results pattern . Results from these analyses are available online ( see Data Availability Statement for details ) . A data-driven approach was taken to identify brain regions with the largest group- and condition-related differences in functional connectivity ( see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods ) . Comparing whole-brain connectedness values by group ( Amusia vs . Controls ) revealed four significant locations ( where z of peak vertices\u00a0>\u00a04 . 61 , FDR-corrected p<0 . 05 ) that showed greater whole-brain connectedness for the control than for the amusia group ( see Figure 3 , yellow crosses ) . All group differences were located in the inferior frontal cortex: two left hemisphere vertices ( inferior frontal gyrus p . triangularis and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ) and two right hemisphere vertices ( inferior frontal gyrus p . triangularis and p . orbitalis ) . There were no areas where whole-brain connectedness differed by Condition , or showed an interaction of Group and Condition . Follow-up testing was conducted on the four significant regions ( Control\u00a0>\u00a0Amusia , collapsed across the three conditions ) identified above to characterize the specific cortical regions driving these group connectivity differences ( Berman et al . , 2016; Gotts et al . , 2012; Jasmin et al . , 2019; Song et al . , 2015 ) . Relative to control participants , amusic participants' left inferior frontal gyrus seed region showed particularly notable decreases in connectivity with the right posterior superior temporal and inferior parietal cortex , as well as with the right posterior superior temporal sulcus ( Figure 3A ) . Analysis of subcortical connectivity indicated that there was also weaker connectivity with the right nucleus accumbens ( Table 1 ) . The left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in amusic participants showed decreased functional connectivity with the mid portions of the right superior temporal gyrus , posterior part of the right middle temporal gyrus extending into the inferior bank of the superior temporal sulcus , and the right anterior insula ( Figure 3A ) . Several subcortical structures - bilateral caudate nucleus and putamen , bilateral pallidum , bilateral cerebellum , and bilateral thalamus - also showed significantly reduced ( FDR-corrected ) connectivity with the seed in amusics ( Table 1 ) . The right pars triangularis seed showed Control\u00a0>\u00a0Amusic connectivity with right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and left posterior superior temporal gyrus ( Figure 3B ) . It also showed decreased connectivity with left nucleus accumbens . Right pars orbitalis showed decreased connectivity with right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ( Figure 3B ) . There was also decreased connectivity with the left thalamus ( Table 1 ) . Of the 30 participants in this study , 21 took part in an experiment that measured the degree to which they relied on pitch versus duration to categorize prosody , that\u00a0is , their \u2018normalized prosodic cue weights\u2019 , which ranged from 0 to 1 , with values greater than 0 . 5 indicating greater reliance on pitch than duration , and values less than 0 . 5 indicating greater reliance on duration than pitch ( Experiment 1 , Jasmin et al . , 2020a ) . These cue weights were assessed with respect to the functional connectivity results reported above . Across this subset of participants , normalized cue weights were correlated with L-DLPFC\u00a0<=>\u00a0R insula connectivity ( Spearman R\u00a0=\u00a00 . 78 , p=0 . 000037 ) , and L-DLPFC\u00a0<=>\u00a0R auditory\u00a0cortex connectivity ( Spearman R\u00a0=\u00a00 . 75 , p=0 . 000154; Figure 4 ) . This indicated that participants who relied least on pitch information to process speech had the weakest functional connectivity between these areas , while those who relied most on pitch had the strongest . Although analyzing the control and amusic groups independently results in extremely small sample sizes , this pattern also held ( albeit with \u2018marginal significance\u2019 ) within the 11 control participants alone , for both auditory cortex connectivity ( R\u00a0=\u00a00 . 58 , p=0 . 06 ) and insular connectivity ( R\u00a0=\u00a00 . 55 , p=0 . 08 ) . Both these correlations were in the predicted direction , suggesting that even non-amusics may perform dimensional reweighting of acoustic dimensions and functional connectivity . Correlations within the ( much more variable ) amusic group alone were weaker and non-significant ( although again , the group size is very small ) . To ensure that\u00a0the pattern of connectivity we observed between groups ( decreased right auditory cortex and right insula with L-DLPFC connectivity ) was not due to intrinsic , task-irrelevant differences in neural architecture , the data from the language task was compared to that collected during passive listening to tone sequences . Whereas during speech perception amusic subjects showed reduced functional connectivity between left frontal and right insula/auditory ROIs relative to controls ( p=0 . 0001 for both ROIs; in line with the whole-brain imaging analyses ) , this pattern did not hold during passive listening to tones ( Amusia vs Control connectivity , p=0 . 29 , Group ( Amusic , Control ) by Task ( Speech Perception , Passive Tone Listening ) interaction p=0 . 045 for the insula ROI; Amusia vs Control p=0 . 30 , Group by Task interaction p=0 . 035 for the auditory cortex ROI - see Figure 5 ) . These interactions suggest that our neural connectivity results are specifically linked to speech perception , rather than reflecting an overall connectivity difference between groups regardless of task state . Although we were concerned with functional connectivity rather than activation , we also tested for differences in activation levels between groups and conditions . False Discovery Rate correction was used to correct for multiple comparisons across both hemispheres for each test ( Group , Condition and Group X Condition ) . No significant differences were detected for the main effects of group and condition , nor the interaction of those factors . \n We found that individuals with amusia , who have been previously shown to rely less on pitch than controls to process spoken language ( Jasmin et al . , 2020a ) , exhibited decreased functional connectivity between left frontal areas and right hemisphere pitch-related regions . In our task , participants matched spoken sentences with visually presented sentences based on pitch , duration , or both these acoustic dimensions together . Using a data-driven approach , we identified four regions in left and right inferior frontal cortex for which the amusic group exhibited decreased functional connectivity with several other sites in frontal , temporal and occipital cortex . The most prominent of these results was decreased connectivity between left frontal regions classically implicated in language processing ( left IFG and DLPFC ) and right hemisphere regions \u2014in the superior temporal gyrus and sulcus , Heschl\u2019s gyrus , and anterior insula\u2014that have been implicated in pitch processing ( Lee et al . , 2011; Garcea et al . , 2017; Warren et al . , 2003; Hohmann et al . , 2018 ) . We suggest that this decreased connectivity between right hemisphere pitch and left hemisphere frontal cortices may relate to the unreliability of the amusics\u2019 perception of and memory for pitch . This is similar to the \u2018weighted connections\u2019 model of multisensory integration , where a more ( or less ) reliable modality is given a stronger ( or weaker ) weight ( Beauchamp et al . , 2010 ) . Congenital amusia is often described as a disorder related to structural and functional connectivity within the right hemisphere , particularly between right inferior frontal cortices and right posterior temporal cortex ( see Peretz , 2016 for review ) . Consistent with this proposal , we found in the present study that right inferior frontal cortex exhibited strongly decreased functional connectivity in the amusia group , and follow-up seed testing revealed that right auditory areas were involved as well . However , we also found that sites in left frontal cortex also showed large decreases in connectivity in amusia , also most prominently with right hemisphere auditory areas . Our results are consistent with an account that right hemisphere auditory areas are not only abnormally connected to right frontal areas ( as observed during tonal tasks ) but are less integrated with frontal left hemisphere regions when processing speech and language . Our null results for group differences in activation during speech processing are consistent with prior reports that amusics and controls do not differ in pitch representations within sensory regions . For example , the extent of pitch-responsive regions within auditory cortex has been shown to be similar in participants with amusia and controls ( Norman-Haignere et al . , 2016 ) . Brainstem encoding of pitch in speech and musical stimuli is similarly unimpaired in individuals with amusia ( Liu et al . , 2015b ) . Moreover , in oddball EEG paradigms , amusics show similar pre-attentive mismatch negativity responses to small pitch deviants , but impaired attention-dependent P300 responses ( Moreau et al . , 2009; Peretz et al . , 2009; Mignault Goulet et al . , 2012; Moreau et al . , 2013 ) . These findings , along with the fact that amusics show intact non-volitional behavioral responses ( unconscious pitch shifts ) when presented with pitch-altered feedback of their own voice ( Hutchins and Peretz , 2012 ) , have been interpreted as evidence that amusia is a disorder of pitch awareness rather than one of low-level pitch processing ( Peretz et al . , 2009 ) , with differences in structural connectivity as one possible foundation of this putative impaired pitch awareness ( Hyde et al . , 2006; Loui et al . , 2009; but see Chen et al . , 2015 ) . Our interpretation of differences in functional connectivity between amusics and controls diverges somewhat from these previous approaches: we argue that down-weighting of pitch information during perceptual categorization in both speech and music is adaptive , inasmuch as amusics have learned that pitch is an unreliable source of evidence relative to other perceptual dimensions . The evidence above suggesting that encoding of pitch in the brainstem and auditory cortex and pre-attentive responses to pitch changes are unaffected in amusia can be interpreted as suggesting that the fundamental deficit in amusia may not be increased perceptual noise or decreased pitch awareness but difficulties with retention of pitch information in memory ( see Tillmann et al . , 2016 for review ) . Our task arguably taxed working memory resources: in a similar paradigm performed by the same participants in quiet listening conditions ( Jasmin et al . , 2020a ) , the mean reaction time measured from the end of the second auditory stimulus was 1 . 64 s , indicating that participants needed some time to compare both auditory presentations and make their judgments . This interpretation is consistent with evidence suggesting that amusics have difficulty with pitch sequence processing tasks even when discrimination thresholds are accounted for ( Tillmann et al . , 2009 ) , as well as the finding that delaying the time interval between standard and comparison tones exacerbates pitch discrimination impairment in individuals with amusia ( Williamson et al . , 2010 ) . Moreover , the pitch awareness account of amusia cannot explain the Jasmin et al . , 2020a finding that pitch cues are downweighted only during longer-scale suprasegmental speech perception , while pitch weighting is not different between amusics and controls during shorter-scale segmental speech perception , despite pitch cues being arguably more subtle in the segmental condition . However , this finding can be explained by the pitch memory account , as the suprasegmental task requires detection of and memory for pitch patterns within a complex sequence , while the segmental task does not . Furthermore , an account of amusia which suggests that the disorder primarily stems from differences in structural connectivity cannot account for the recent finding that functional connectivity patterns do not differ between amusics and controls during a verbal memory task ( Albouy et al . , 2019 ) , as well as our finding that amusics and controls show similar functional connectivity patterns during passive listening to tone sequences . We suggest , therefore , that amusics neglect pitch because they have implicitly learned that their memory for pitch is unreliable , and that this down-weighting of pitch is reflected in decreased functional connectivity between right auditory areas and downstream task-relevant areas which integrate information from perceptual regions . One way to test this hypothesis would be to examine functional connectivity during perceptual categorization of consonant-vowel syllables as voiced versus unvoiced based on a pitch cue ( F0 of the following vowel ) and a durational cue ( voice onset time ) . We predict , based on our previous findings ( Jasmin et al . , 2020a ) , that functional connectivity will not differ between amusics and controls on this task , a finding which would not be predicted by the pitch awareness account of amusia . We note that a previous fMRI study on amusia detected group differences in functional connectivity during passive listening to tones . That study used task-defined seed voxels in bilateral auditory cortex and found , in the amusia group , increased connectivity between left and right auditory cortex , but decreased connectivity between right auditory cortex and right inferior frontal gyrus ( Hyde et al . , 2011 ) . The present study does not necessarily clash with these findings , as we used different seed ROIs selected with a different procedure . We did not observe any differences in functional connectivity between conditions in our speech task . This may be because our functional imaging protocol was timed to capture the peak in the BOLD signal corresponding to the presentation of the second auditory stimulus . Participants never knew ( even implicitly ) which acoustic dimension might be useful on any given trial until after they had heard both spoken sentences and needed to compare them to make their response . Furthermore , pitch fluctuations in the stimuli were above participants\u2019 thresholds , even in the Duration-Informative condition ( where the standard deviation of F0 over each spoken utterance was , on average , 2 . 7 semitones ) , and so it is unsurprising that functional connectivity did not change on a trial-by-trial basis , and instead the same \u2018neural strategy\u2019 was employed to process speech regardless of the trial type . Several other future directions are suggested by our results , particularly for examining cue weighting during auditory/speech perception . In the multimodal integration studies mentioned above ( Beauchamp et al . , 2010; Nath and Beauchamp , 2011 ) , reliability of two different sensory modalities was manipulated experimentally by severely degrading input channels with noise , resulting in changes in connectivity . Similarly , aspects of speech could be selectively masked with noise in order to make them less reliable , which in turn could cause corresponding changes in functional or effective connectivity . Indeed , behavioral work has indicated that when fundamental frequency ( pitch ) or durational aspects of speech are manipulated to be unreliable cues , categorization behavior shifts such that participants place less relative weight on the dimension that has been made less reliable ( Holt and Lotto , 2010 ) . Certain groups , such as tone language speakers , are known to have fine-grained pitch perception abilities , and tend to place greater weight on pitch even when processing speech from a second , non-tonal language that they have learned ( e . g . English; Yu and Andruski , 2010; Zhang and Francis , 2010 , Zhang et al . , 2008; Qin et al . , 2017; Jasmin et al . , 2020a ) . Given the increased reliability of their pitch perception , tone language speakers may exhibit correspondingly high connectivity strength between right hemisphere auditory regions and left hemisphere \u2018language regions\u2019 when pitch cues are present ( more so than native non-tonal language speakers ) . Expert musicians also have extensive pitch-related experience and training and could also serve as a population to examine in future work . \n Participants , 15 individuals with amusia ( 10 F , age\u00a0=\u00a060 . 2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09 . 4 , range\u00a0=\u00a043\u201374 ) and 15 controls ( 10 F , age\u00a0=\u00a061 . 3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010 . 4 , range\u00a0=\u00a038\u201374 ) , were recruited from the UK and were native British English speakers . The amusic group sample size reflected the maximum number of participants that could be screened and tested during our data collection period . The control group sample size was matched to this . All participants gave informed consent , and ethical approval was obtained from the relevant UCL and Birkbeck ethics committees . Amusia status was obtained using the Montreal Battery for the Evaluation of Amusia ( MBEA ) . Participants with a composite score ( summing the Scale , Contour and Interval tests scores ) of 65 or less were classified as having amusia ( Peretz et al . , 2003 ) . We also note that the amusics defined using the MBEA had higher pitch thresholds than controls ( Wilcoxon Rank Sum W\u00a0=\u00a029 , p=0 . 001 ) but did not differ from controls in tone duration discrimination ( W\u00a0=\u00a0129 , p=0 . 74 ) , speech-in-noise threshold ( W\u00a0=\u00a0155 . 5 , p=0 . 17 ) , or audiometric hearing thresholds ( t ( 28 ) = 1 . 33 , p=0 . 20; see Jasmin et al . , 2020a for detailed methods for these procedures ) . The stimuli were 42 compound sentences that consisted of a pre-posed subordinate clause followed by a main clause ( see Figure 1 for an example , and Jasmin et al . , 2020a , Jasmin et al . , 2020b for details ) . There were two versions of each sentence: ( 1 ) an \u2018early closure\u2019 version , where the verb of the subordinate clause was used intransitively and the following noun was the subject of a new clause [\u2018After Jane dusts , the dining table [is clean]\u201d]; and ( 2 ) , \u2018late closure\u2019 , where the verb was transitive and took the following noun as its object , moving the phrase boundary to a slightly later position in the sentence [\u2018After Jane dusts the dining table , [it is clean]\u201d] . The words in both versions of the sentence were identical from the start of the sentence until the end of the second noun ( \u2018After Jane dusts the dining table \u2026\u201d ) , and only the lexically identical portions of the sentences were presented to participants; thus the two stimuli did not differ in words spoken . A native British English speaking male ( who had previously trained as an actor ) recorded early closure and late closure versions of each sentence in a sound-proofed room . The recordings were cropped such that only the portions with the same words remained , and silent pauses after phrase breaks were removed . Synthesized versions of these sentences were created with STRAIGHT voice-morphing software ( Kawahara and Irino , 2005 ) . First , the two versions of the sentence were manually time-aligned by marking corresponding \u2018anchor points\u2019 in the two recordings . Then , morphed speech was synthesized by varying the degree to which the early closure and late closure recordings contributed duration and pitch information . We synthesized pairs of stimuli in three conditions: ( 1 ) In the Pitch-Informative condition , the stimulus pair had exactly the same durational properties ( that is , the length of phonemes , syllables , and words was the average between the two original recordings ) but the vocal pitch indicated early or late closure at a morphing level of 80%; ( 2 ) in the Duration-Informative condition , vocal pitch in the stimulus pair was identical ( at 50% between both versions ) but the durational characteristics indicated early or late closure at a morphing level of 80%; ( 3 ) in the Both-Informative condition , both pitch and time cued early or late closure simultaneously at 80% . The morphed speech varied only in duration and pitch , while all other aspects of the acoustics ( such as amplitude and spectral characteristics other than pitch ) were the same , held constant at 50% between the two original recordings during morphing . This stimulus set is freely available ( Jasmin et al . , 2020b ) . Across all stimuli , F0 ( vocal pitch ) differences between early and late closure versions were large , with a mean of maximum difference of 7 . 7 semitones and range of 4 . 0\u201312 . 6 semitones . Thus , even the stimulus pair with the smallest pitch difference ( 4 . 0 semitones ) exceeded the\u00a0~1 . 5 semitone pitch change detection threshold of the \u2018most impaired\u2019 participant in the amusia group ( Jasmin et al . , 2020a ) , which increased the chances that the amusia group would not suffer from poor performance , thereby avoiding a performance-related confound with our experimental design ( see Church et al . , 2010 for discussion ) . Subjects were scanned with a Siemens Avanto 1 . 5 Tesla magnetic resonance imaging scanner with a 32-channel head coil , with sounds presented via Sensimetrics S14 earbuds , padded around the ear with NoMoCo memory foam cushions . Functional data were collected using a slow event-related design with sparse temporal sampling to allow presentation of auditory stimuli in quiet . We used an echo planar image sequence , with 40 slices , slice time 85 ms , slab tilted to capture the entire cerebrum and dorsal cerebellum , ascending sequential acquisition; 3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a03\u00a0\u00d7\u00a03 mm voxel size; silent stimulus and response period\u00a0=\u00a08 . 7 s , volume acquisition time\u00a0=\u00a03 . 4 s , total inter-trial interval\u00a0=\u00a012 . 1 s , flip angle\u00a0=\u00a090 degrees , bandwidth\u00a0=\u00a02298 Hz/pixel , echo time ( TE ) =\u00a050 ms . After collecting functional runs , a high-resolution T1-weighted structural scan was collected ( MPRAGE , 176 slices , sagittal acquisition , 2x GRAPPA acceleration , 1 mm isotropic voxels , acquisition matrix\u00a0=\u00a0224\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0256 ) . Each run began with three dummy scans to allow magnetic stabilization . Each trial ( repetition time ) lasted 12 . 1 s . The start of each trial was triggered by a pulse corresponding to the start of a volume acquisition ( which acquired neural data from the previous trial , at a delay ) . At t\u00a0=\u00a01 s into the trial , the sentence appeared on the screen; before scanning participants were instructed to read each sentence silently to themselves . At t\u00a0=\u00a05 s ( plus or minus a random 100 ms jitter ) participants heard a spoken version of the first part of the sentence . At t\u00a0=\u00a07 . 4 s ( plus or minus 100 ms jitter ) the second version was presented . The two spoken versions contained the same words but their pitch and/or timing characteristics cued a phrase boundary that occurred earlier or later in the sentence . Following this , there were approximately 2 s of silence during which the participant responded with the button box , before the scanner began acquiring the next volume at t\u00a0=\u00a012 . 1 s . Participants performed three blocks of 42 trials ( 14 each of Pitch-Informative , Duration-Informative , and Both-Informative ) with 8 Rest trials interspersed within each block . Following data collection for this task and the structural scan , participants took part in two task-free fMRI scanning runs in which they watched a silent film ( The General , starring Buster Keaton , or an episode of the Planet Earth series played without sound ) while being presented auditorily with semi-random tone sequences . Stimuli consisted of sequences of \u2018pips\u2019 - 30 ms 6-harmonic complex tones . The fundamental frequencies of the pips were either 440 , 466 . 16 , 493 . 88 or 523 . 25 Hz , and the time between tone onsets was 0 . 075 , 0 . 125 , 0 . 175 , or 0 . 225 s . The transition probabilities ( determining whether pip N+1 had the same pitch or duration properties as pitch N ) were set at either 0 . 1 and 0 . 9 for duration and either 0 . 3 and 0 . 7 for pitch . These two transition parameters were \u2018crossed\u2019 to create four design cells , and 25 random sequences were generated for each cell . MRI scanning parameters were identical to those used in the active , prosody task , except the time between volume acquisitions was 17 . 1 s . Participants listened to 100 tone sequences across two runs ( 50 per run ) . Matlab code used to create the stimuli can be found online ( see Data Availability Statement ) . Image preprocessing was performed with FreeSurfer 6 . 0 . 0 ( Fischl , 2012 ) and AFNI-SUMA 18 . 1 . 18 ( Cox , 1996 ) . Anatomical images were registered to the third echo planar image of the first run using Freesurfer\u2019s bbregister and processed with FreeSurfer\u2019s automated pipeline for segmenting tissue types , generating cortical surface models , and parcellating subcortical structures . Masks of inferior colliculi were obtained by manually examining individual subjects\u2019 anatomical images and selecting a single EPI voxel located at its centre , bilaterally . Freesurfer cortical surface models were imported to AFNI with the @SUMA_Make_Spec_FS program . Then a standard pre-processing pipeline using AFNI\u2019s afniproc . py program was used: all echo planar image volumes were aligned to the third repetition time of the first run using AFNI\u2019s 3DAllineate , intersected with the cortical surface with SUMA , smoothed along the surface with a 2D 6-mm-FWHM kernel , and converted to a standard mesh ( std . 141 ) for group analyses , separately for each hemisphere , where each vertex in the mesh ( 198812 per hemisphere ) is aligned to the 'same' location in the cortex across subjects , using curvature-based morphing . Preprocessing of the passive listening experiment data was identical . The magnitude of transient head motion was calculated from the six motion parameters obtained during image realignment and aggregated as a single variable using AFNI's @1dDiffMag to calculate a Motion Index ( Berman et al . , 2016; Gotts et al . , 2012; Jasmin et al . , 2019 ) . This measure is similar to average Frame Displacement over a scan ( Power et al . , 2012 ) and is in units of mm per repetition time . The difference in average motion between the groups was small ( amusia group mean motion\u00a0=\u00a00 . 31 mm/TR; control group mean\u00a0=\u00a00 . 28 mm/TR ) and amounted to 32 micrometers ( ~1/30th of a millimeter ) per TR . The mean and distribution of motion did not differ statistically between groups ( two sample t-test p=0 . 70 , two-tailed ) . Given the previous reports ( described above ) of changes in connection strength between unimodal and multimodal areas in response to noise ( Beauchamp et al . , 2010; Nath and Beauchamp , 2011 ) , we chose a connectivity-based analysis approach for our study . Beta series correlation ( Rissman et al . , 2004 ) is a technique for examining functional connectivity and its modulation by task , using correlations in trial-by-trial responses . It has been shown to be more powerful than alternatives such as generalized psycho-physiological interaction ( gPPI ) for event-related designs ( Cisler et al . , 2014 ) . In a beta series analysis , one beta weight is calculated for each trial in the experiment ( rather than for each condition ) . All the trial-wise betas associated with a given condition are then serially ordered to form a \u2018beta series\u2019 . Finally , using the beta series in the same way as a standard BOLD fMRI time series , functional connectivity ( measured as Pearson correlations ) is calculated between seed regions of interest and the rest of the brain . Differences in functional connectivity can then be examined by comparing groups , comparing conditions , or examining the interaction of these factors . Our experiment used a slow event-related design with a long repetition time ( 12 . 1 s ) and sparse temporal sampling ( with volume acquisition separated by silent periods ) . Therefore , the time between acquisitions was long enough for the haemodynamic response to return to baseline , and each echo planar image acquisition corresponded to exactly one trial ( Figure 1 ) . For this reason , we did not convolve the echo planar image time series with a basis function during subject-level statistical analysis ( Hall et al . , 1999 ) . In the design matrix for obtaining trial-wise betas , 126 column regressors were used ( one for each non-rest trial ) . Each column vector was of length 150 ( corresponding to all trials , including rest trials ) and had a single \u2018one\u2019 in the position where the trial associated with that column occurred , while zeros were located in every other position . Polynomials up to second degree were also included in the model , on a run-wise basis , to remove the mean and any linear or quadratic trends . Fitting the trial regressors on a subject-wise basis resulted in cortical surface models of beta weights for each of the 126 trials , at each vertex on the reduced-vertex icosahedral cortical surface , with beta weights reflecting the neural response associated with that trial . As noted above , trial-wise betas were then serially ordered to form beta series separately for each of the three experimental conditions ( Pitch-Informative , Duration-Informative , and Both-Informative ) ( Rissman et al . , 2004 ) . Because there were 30 participants , this procedure resulted in a total of 90 beta series ( 30 participants\u00a0\u00d7\u00a03 conditions=90 beta series ) . As for the passive tone listening data , because all \u2018trials\u2019 were of the same type , it was not necessary to separate them into conditions and perform a first-level model to obtain betas . However , polynomials up to second degree were detrended from the pre-processed data ( as was done with the task data ) . Beta series analysis requires initial seed voxels , vertices , or regions to be identified , whose trial-to-trial changes in activity are then compared to those of the rest of the brain . Rather than choose a priori seeds derived from the literature , which used mainly musical tasks or resting state , we used a data-driven approach to search for the largest group and condition differences in functional connectivity ( Berman et al . , 2016; Cole et al . , 2010; Gotts et al . , 2012; Jasmin et al . , 2019; Meoded et al . , 2015; Song et al . , 2015; Steel et al . , 2016; Stoddard et al . , 2016; Watsky et al . , 2018 ) . To do this , we first calculated the \u2018whole-brain connectedness\u2019 of each cortical vertex ( a procedure available in AFNI as the 3dTCorrMap function ) . The whole-brain connectedness of a given vertex is defined as the Pearson correlation of activity within that vertex/voxel and the average signal across all neural gray matter in the rest of the brain . Mathematically , this is equivalent to calculating thousands of Pearson correlations , of a given vertex/voxel series and every other vertex/voxel series in the brain , and then taking the mean of those correlations ( Cole et al . , 2010 ) , then repeating the process for every individual voxel/vertex . As such , it represents the global connectedness ( or \u2018global correlation\u2019 ) of a vertex/voxel . To calculate whole-brain connectedness , first , the average of trial-wise betas in gray matter across the brain was calculated in volume space , separately for each subject and for each condition , by running first-level ( subject ) models . The statistical models were identical to those conducted on the cortical surface , described above , but were performed on volumetric Talairach images instead of the cortical surfaces . The reason for this choice was so that voxels in cortex and subcortex would contribute equally to our measure of global ( whole-brain ) connectivity . First , the\u00a0average gray-matter beta value was calculated for each trial by intersecting each image in the beta series with a whole-brain gray matter mask ( which excluded white matter and ventricles ) and calculating the average beta value within the mask ( Gotts et al . , 2012; Jasmin et al . , 2019 ) . Next , this gray matter average was correlated with each cortical surface vertex\u2019s beta series , separately for each subject and condition , to obtain whole-brain connectedness maps . These values were then subjected to a statistical analysis based on our 2 ( Group ) \u00d7\u00a03 ( Condition ) experimental design . Linear mixed effects models ( AFNI\u2019s 3dLME ) ( Chen et al . , 2013 ) were constructed whose dependent variables were the vertex-wise whole-brain connectedness maps from each beta series . Group and Condition and their interaction were included as fixed effects . Participant was treated as a random intercept . Results of this step were corrected vertex-wise for multiple comparisons with False Discovery Rate ( q\u00a0<\u00a00 . 05 ) , separately for each test ( Main Effect of Group; Main Effect of Condition; Interaction of Group by Condition ) by pooling the p-values from both hemispheres\u2019 cortical surfaces . This False Discovery Rate threshold corresponded to uncorrected p<4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22126 for the Main Effect of Group . Four significant results ( contiguous significant vertices ) survived this threshold and were taken forward for the next analysis step . For the Main Effect of Condition and Interaction of Condition x Group , no results survived statistical correction at\u00a0FDR ( q\u00a0<\u00a00 . 05 ) . An analogous procedure was run on the passive tone listening data , in which whole-brain connectedness values were compared by group ( amusic vs . control ) in a linear mixed effects model . No significant FDR-corrected group differences were detected , nor at a reasonable uncorrected threshold of p<0 . 001 . A similar procedure was performed for subcortical structures . Beta series were obtained for each subject , structure , and experimental condition , from their standard Freesurfer subcortical parcellations by masking the EPI data within each structure and calculating the average of the voxels . Each structure\u2019s beta series was then correlated with the whole-brain gray matter beta average , separately for each condition , and the resulting values were subjected to linear mixed effects models with the same factors as above . Tests for Main Effect of Condition , of Group , and the Interaction of these factors was performed . All p-values were greater than p>0 . 001 and no results survived an FDR-correction calculated over them . The first analysis step ( seed definition , described above ) identified which , if any , brain areas showed the largest connectivity differences between groups . However , this step is insufficient to localize the other specific regions driving this pattern . An analogy is in Analysis of Variance , where a significant omnibus test indicates a difference exists , but follow-up testing is required to determine where in the model differences exist ( Gotts et al . , 2012 ) . Thus , to locate the regions driving this pattern , we undertook a second step: follow-up seed-to-whole-brain testing ( Cole et al . , 2010; Gotts et al . , 2012; Jasmin et al . , 2019 ) . Each seed region was examined with respect to its connectivity pattern with every cortical vertex and subcortical structure . For each of the 90 beta series ( 30 subjects by three conditions ) , values within the seed vertices were averaged and then correlated with the beta series for every vertex in the brain . These correlations were Fisher Z-transformed and used as the dependent variables in linear mixed effects models ( 3dLME ) with the same fixed and random effects as above . For each of the seeds , we tested for the group difference ( Amusia vs Control ) in connectivity . Results were False Discovery Rate corrected to ( q\u00a0<\u00a00 . 05 ) across all eight follow-up tests [four seeds\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02 hemispheres] corresponding to a threshold of p<0 . 00035 . Similarly , for the subcortical structures , each seed beta series was correlated with subcortical structure beta series , with resulting values subject to statistical testing . An FDR correction over all tests involving subcortex was applied . For display in figures , the data were converted from SUMA\u2019s standard mesh ( std . 141 ) to Freesurfer\u2019s standard surface ( fsaverage ) using AFNI\u2019s SurfToSurf program and mapping values from the closest nodes ( i . e . vertices ) . To determine whether the functional connectivity patterns we observed were related to the importance placed on acoustic dimensions during prosodic categorization ( cue weighting ) , the functional connectivity results were analyzed with respect to previously acquired cue weights obtained behaviorally from a subset of participants ( Jasmin et al . , 2020a ) . The right anterior insula and right auditory cortex results were used as ROIs ( Figure 3A ) . The beta series for each ROI ( averaged across vertices ) was correlated with the beta series within the L-DLPFC seed area , separately for each condition , then averaged and Fisher Z-transformed . For the 21 participants for whom we had prosodic cue weight data ( from Jasmin et al . , 2020a ) , these cue weights were analyzed with respect to the functional connectivity between the L-DLPFC seed and the two ROIs using Spearman correlations . As described above , functional connectivity between L-DLPFC , and right auditory cortex and right insula was calculated using data from the passive tone listening task , using ROIs derived from the active speech perception task . After pre-processing and de-trending , the averaged value from the tone listening experiment within these ROIs was extracted , as well as the LDLPFC seed , for each experiment . Correlations between signal within the seed and the two ROIs was calculated and Fisher Z-transformed . As mentioned above , because all trials in the tone-listening experiment were analyzed as the same type , it was not necessary to use a first-level model to obtain trial-wise betas . Similarly for the data from the speech task , the average value within the seed region and both ROIs was extracted , separately for each of the 3 Beta series ( Pitch- , Time- and Both-Informative ) , and the seed and ROI series were correlated . The mean of these three correlation coefficients was calculated and Fisher Z-transformed . Finally , statistics were performed using a mixed ANOVA with Experiment ( Speech or Tones ) as the within-subject factor and Group ( Amusia or Control ) as the between-subject factor . A standard General Linear Model comparing activation strength ( rather than connectivity ) was also conducted . As in the General Linear Model for obtaining beta weights , no basis function was used , and polynomials up to second degree were included in the models . The data that support the findings of this study are openly available in the Birkbeck repository ( https://researchdata . bbk . ac . uk/65/ ) , as are the speech stimuli ( Jasmin et al . , 2020b; https://researchdata . bbk . ac . uk/37/ ) .

{"lay_summary": "While cancer cells typically cannot spread between individuals , there are a few examples of contagious tumours . Remarkably , two examples have emerged in a single species , the Tasmanian devil , a marsupial carnivore . These tumours are known as Devil Facial Tumour 1 ( or DFT1 ) and Devil Facial Tumour 2 ( or DFT2 ) ; both cause tumours round the faces of infected devils . Since it emerged in the 1990s , DFT1 has killed 60\u201390% of the devil population . Preserving the few remaining healthy devils has been a major challenge for conservationists . This challenge became more urgent in 2014 , when the second contagious cancer , DFT2 , was discovered circulating in the population . Contagious cancers are rare because the immune system usually eliminates cells coming from outside the body . Each healthy cell carries molecules known as the major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) that act as a barcode showing where each cell comes from . The immune system uses these molecules to help it tell the difference between the body\u2019s own cells and those from elsewhere . DFT1 can avoid the immune system and spread to new hosts because it has lost MHC . In 2014 , scientists identified a new Tasmanian devil cancer named DFT2 , but it was unclear how this second cancer evades the immune system as it spreads from host to host . Caldwell et al . have now examined the MHC on cells from DFT2 cancers , including cells grown in the laboratory and cells taken from cancer biopsies . Biochemical tests showed that the DFT2 cells do carry MHCs , but that the MHC barcodes of DFT2 are similar to those of the devils infected with the disease . This finding may explain how the cancer can spread undetected in these animals , because the immune system does not recognize it as coming from outside the body . Further analyses also reveal that the cancer cells are slowly evolving to lose their MHCs . This means DFT2 could , with time , become as contagious as DFT1 . These two contagious cancers threaten the future of the Tasmanian devil . As top predators , devils are key to the ecosystem in Tasmania and their preservation is vital . While DFT2 provides a unique opportunity to study an emerging cancer as it develops , this research will also help to protect the devils and may lead to effective vaccines . These results could also reveal how other cancers avoid the immune system and may help to detect them during treatment . In addition , there are many similarities between contagious cancer cells and organ transplants . Understanding the role of MHC in DFT2 could lead to better ways to prevent rejection following transplants .", "article": "Devil Facial Tumour 2 ( DFT2 ) is a recently discovered contagious cancer circulating in the Tasmanian devil ( Sarcophilus harrisii ) , a species which already harbours a more widespread contagious cancer , Devil Facial Tumour 1 ( DFT1 ) . Here we show that in contrast to DFT1 , DFT2 cells express major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) class I molecules , demonstrating that loss of MHC is not necessary for the emergence of a contagious cancer . However , the most highly expressed MHC class I alleles in DFT2 cells are common among host devils or non-polymorphic , reducing immunogenicity in a population sharing these alleles . In parallel , MHC class I loss is emerging in vivo , thus DFT2 may be mimicking the evolutionary trajectory of DFT1 . Based on these results we propose that contagious cancers may exploit partial histocompatibility between the tumour and host , but that loss of allogeneic antigens could facilitate widespread transmission of DFT2 . \n Contagious cancers have emerged and circulate in two species of mammals ( dogs and Tasmanian devils ) and four species of molluscs ( Metzger et al . , 2015 , 2016; Novinski , 1876; Pearse and Swift , 2006 ) . The Tasmanian devil is the only mammalian species in which two independent contagious cancers exist , Devil Facial Tumour 1 ( DFT1 ) and Devil Facial Tumour 2 ( DFT2 ) ( Pye et al . , 2016b ) . Although both cancers have similar gross morphology , causing tumours on the face , neck and oral cavity , genetic analysis shows that they emerged in different individuals ( Pearse and Swift , 2006; Pye et al . , 2016b; Stammnitz et al . , 2018 ) . DFT1 was first identified in 1996 in the northeast of Tasmania ( Hawkins et al . , 2006 ) , but has since spread widely , causing close to 100% mortality and drastic decline of affected populations ( Hamede et al . , 2015 ) . In contrast , DFT2 is a more recent contagious cancer , it was first characterised in 2014 and has been formally identified in eleven devils from the Channel region of Southwest Tasmania ( Pye et al . , 2016b; Kwon et al . , 2018 ) . Recent immunohistochemical and drug sensitivity analyses of DFT2 indicate it arose from a similar tissue to DFT1 ( Stammnitz et al . , 2018 ) . As allografts , DFT1 and DFT2 cells should be rejected by the host devil through T cell recognition of non-self MHC class I molecules encoded by the major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) ( Sherman and Chattopadhyay , 1993 ) . The mature MHC class I molecule is a trimer that acts as a ligand for the T cell receptor ( TCR ) and is composed of a light chain , \u03b22-microglobulin ( \u03b22m ) , in non-covalent association with a heavy chain , which provides a binding cleft for self and non-self peptides . Classical MHC class I molecules are important transplantation antigens that are highly polymorphic , ubiquitously expressed and involved in peptide-antigen presentation . In contrast , non-classical MHC class I molecules have little polymorphism and more diverse functions , including regulation of the immune response particularly by inhibiting natural killer ( NK ) cell function ( Braud et al . , 1999 ) . Allografts can be rejected within 7\u201314 days when host CD8+\u00a0T cells are exposed to non-self MHC class I molecules and their bound peptides on the surface of donor cells ( Rosenberg , 1993 ) . Vertebrates have multiple MHC class I genes that are generally not orthologous between species due to rapid evolution ( Adams and Parham , 2001 ) . Five MHC class I genes have been identified in the genomic region encoding the Tasmanian devil MHC ( Cheng et al . , 2012 ) . Saha-UA , -UB and \u2013UC , are likely classical , with moderate levels of polymorphism and ubiquitous expression , while Saha-UD , \u2013UK and -UM , are non-classical , with limited polymorphism and restricted expression ( Cheng et al . , 2012; Cheng and Belov , 2014 ) . We have previously demonstrated that DFT1 cells down-regulate MHC class I and class II molecules from their cell surface , thereby removing the targets for a T cell response ( Siddle et al . , 2013 ) . This is the first indication that DFT1 cells have similar immune evasion mechanisms to those found in single organism tumours ( Hicklin et al . , 1999; McGranahan et al . , 2017 ) . Loss of MHC class I is due to epigenetic down-regulation of \u03b22m , and the peptide transporter encoded by TAP1 and TAP2 ( Siddle et al . , 2013 ) but MHC class I can be restored in DFT1 cells when treated with IFN\u03b3 ( Siddle et al . , 2013 ) . MHC class I positive DFT1 cells have since been used with some success in initiating immune responses to DFT1 cells ( Tovar et al . , 2017 ) . Down-regulation of MHC is also observed in the canine transmissible venereal tumour ( CTVT ) , where MHC molecules are down-regulated during transmission and growth ( Hsiao et al . , 2002; P\u00e9rez et al . , 1998 ) . However , subsequent cytokine signalling leads to lymphocyte infiltration of tumours , MHC up-regulation and either tumour regression or stasis of growth ( Yang et al . , 1987 ) . These findings have suggested that loss of MHC class I expression is necessary for the emergence and subsequent transmission of contagious cancers . Why DFT2 cells can pass between individuals without a protective immune response from the host is not known , nor are the conditions that have facilitated the emergence of two contagious cancers in this species . Here we show that in contrast to DFT1 , DFT2 cells express MHC class I molecules . However , the dominantly expressed MHC class I alleles are either non-classical or shared with host devils and common in the wider population . Finally , DFT2 tumours were identified with evidence of MHC class I loss , indicating the emergence of MHC class I down-regulation in this tumour . \n Flow cytometry using a monoclonal antibody against Tasmanian devil \u03b22m was used to assess the level of MHC class I expression on the surface of a representative DFT1 cell line ( DFT1_4906 ) ( Figure 1A ) , DFT1 cells treated with IFN\u03b3 ( DFT1_4906\u00a0+\u00a0IFN\u03b3 ) ( Figure 1B ) , three DFT2 cell lines ( DFT2_RV , DFT2_SN and DFT2_TD549 ) ( Figure 1C , D and E ) and devil fibroblast cells ( Fibroblasts_Salem ) ( Figure 1F ) . As has been previously reported ( Siddle et al . , 2013 ) , DFT1 cells do not express \u03b22m , but DFT1 cells treated with IFN\u03b3 upregulate \u03b22m to the same level as devil fibroblast cells . In contrast , all three DFT2 cell lines express cell surface \u03b22m , but the level of expression varies , DFT2_TD549 cells have the highest level of expression ( Mean Fluorescence Intensity ( MFI ) 42 . 1 ) followed by DFT2_RV ( MFI 37 . 6 ) and DFT2_SN ( MFI 12 . 1 ) . Although all three DFT2 cell lines express \u03b22m , they have lower levels of \u03b22m than DFT1 cells that have been treated with IFN\u03b3 ( MFI 92 . 5 ) and devil fibroblasts ( MFI 93 . 3 ) . These results indicate that DFT2 cells grown in culture express surface MHC class I molecules in contrast to DFT1 , which is MHC class I negative . RT-qPCR was used to quantify the relative level of MHC class I gene expression for \u03b22m , classical MHC class I and non-classical MHC class I genes in vitro ( Figure 2A\u2013D ) . Due to high nucleotide similarity between the classical MHC class I genes in the Tasmanian devil , Saha-UA , -UB and \u2013UC , and their respective alleles , a single primer set was used to amplify transcripts from these genes as a group . Gene specific primers were used to amplify the non-classical MHC class I genes , Saha-UK ( Figure 2C ) and Saha-UD , which was found only at trace levels ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . RT-qPCR shows that DFT2 cells express significantly higher levels of \u03b22m ( Figure 2A ) , classical MHC class I heavy chain genes ( Saha-UA , -UB and -UC ) ( Figure 2B ) and non-classical MHC class I ( Saha-UK ) ( Figure 2C ) than DFT1_4906 . However , expression of \u03b22m and Saha-UA , -UB and -UC by DFT2 cells is lower than that of DFT1_4906\u00a0+\u00a0IFN\u03b3 and Fibroblasts , which is consistent with the levels of \u03b22m expression observed on the DFT2 cell lines . Interestingly , while the levels of Saha-UA , -UB and -UC in the three DFT2 cell lines is lower than DFT1_4906\u00a0+\u00a0IFN\u03b3 ( Figure 2B and D ) , the levels of Saha-UK are not significantly different ( Figure 2C and D ) . This is despite the fact that the expression level of the classical MHC class I genes reflects the amplification of three different MHC class I loci compared to a single locus , Saha-UK . Thus , DFT2 cells in vitro express both classical and non-classical MHC class I heavy chain genes . To extend this analysis to primary DFT2 tumours we used RT-PCR to amplify \u03b22m and MHC class I heavy chain transcripts from the DFT2 cell lines and six primary DFT2 tumours collected between March 2014 and January 2016 ( Figure 2E and Supplementary file 1 ) . The primary tumours include DFT2_RVT1 and DFT2_SNT2 from which the cell lines DFT2_RV and DFT2_SN were derived . RT-PCR shows evidence of expression for \u03b22m in the cell lines and in primary tumour samples ( Figure 2E ) , reflecting the expression of cell surface \u03b22m protein in the cell lines . Saha-UK is expressed in all cell lines and primary biopsies . The cell lines and primary tumours express classical MHC class I , but the expression levels appear to be variable between the primary tumours . While this analysis is not quantitative , as the amount of stroma in each sample varies between tumours , these results show that DFT2 cells express both classical and non-classical MHC class I transcripts alongside \u03b22m . To further investigate the expression of MHC class I molecules between DFT2 tumours in vivo , a shared peptide immunogen was used to raise a pan-classical MHC I antibody against the classical MHC class I heavy chains ( Saha-UA , -UB and -UC ) . A second peptide , specific in sequence to Saha-UK , was used to raise an antibody against the non-classical MHC class I , Saha-UK . Monoclonal antibodies were initially screened by western blot using protein from devil fibroblast cells . Positive clones were re-screened for molecule specificity against recombinant Saha-UK and recombinant Saha-UC protein ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . Clones specific for Saha-UK ( clone - \u03b1-UK_15-29-1 ) and Saha-UA \u2013UB and -UC ( clone - \u03b1-UA/UB/UC_15-25-18 ) were identified . Staining of DFT2 serial sections from six primary DFT2 tumours ( Supplementary file 1 ) with these antibodies demonstrates expression of both classical ( Saha-UA , -UB and \u2013UC ) and non-classical ( Saha-UK ) MHC class I molecules in vivo ( Figure 3 and Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . However , this analysis also demonstrates that MHC class I expression is variable in DFT2 tumours . Three of the tumours , DFT2_RVT1 , DFT2_SNT2 and DFT2_818T1 ( Figure 3 ) , retain strong expression of classical class I molecules , with localisation to the cell membrane . This result is consistent with the cell surface expression of \u03b22m observed on the DFT2_RV and DFT2_SN cell lines , derived from two of these primary tumours ( Figure 1C and D ) . However , expression of classical MHC class I in DFT2_547 and DFT2_523 is weaker , appears mostly cytoplasmic and shows some variation in staining intensity , with some cells in DFT2_547 showing very low levels of expression . Strikingly , DFT2_812 is negative for classical MHC class I ( Figure 3 ) . The expression of Saha-UK also varies between and within DFT2 biopsies ( Figure 3 ) . DFT2_RVT1 cells are uniformly positive for Saha-UK , whereas DFT2_SNT2 and DFT2_547 have variable expression , with some areas staining more weakly . Interestingly , there is some evidence for Saha-UK staining in DFT2_812 , a tumour negative for classical MHC class I , but DFT2_523 is largely Saha-UK negative ( Figure 3 ) . While the DFT2 tumours with strong classical class I expression show localisation to the cell membrane ( i . e . cell surface expression ) , staining for Saha-UK shows a cytoplasmic distribution in some of the DFT2 tumours . Notably , DFT2 tumours also show morphological heterogeneity ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3 ) . DFT2 tumour cells are sometimes arranged as nests separated by a fibroblastic stroma , for example DFT2_547T1 , but can also be arranged in diffuse sheets separated by a fibrous component , for example DFT2_818T1 and DFT2_523T1 . The degree of individual tumour cell nuclear pleomorphism can also vary within the same tumour ( DFT2_SNT2 ) . The expression of MHC molecules by DFT2 cells may mean that this tumour is more immunogenic than DFT1 . As infiltration of lymphocytes has been correlated with a positive prognostic outcome for some cancers ( Galon et al . , 2006; Chee et al . , 2017 ) we stained DFT2 tumours for the lymphocyte marker , CD3 . Staining of the primary tumours shows that lymphocyte infiltration does occur in some individuals ( Figure 4 ) . No CD3 positive cells were observed in DFT2_RV or DFT2_547 ( Figure 4 ) , but a more significant number of CD3 positive cells is evident in DFT2_818 , DFT2_523 and DFT2_812 ( Figure 4 ) , where the lymphocytes are clustered at the stroma and some cells can be seen infiltrating the tumour mass . A small number of CD3 positive cells are visible in DFT2_SN ( Figure 4 ) . The classical MHC class I alleles expressed by DFT2 cells should play a role in any host immune response against the tumour . To assess the MHC class I alleles expressed by DFT2 cells we amplified , cloned and sequenced exon 2 ( the region of the devil MHC class I where the majority of variation is located ) of MHC class I transcripts from DFT2 cell lines . Previous analysis of DFT2 DNA has identified four MHC class I sequences from Saha-UA , Saha-UB and Saha-UC and one sequence from Saha-UD present in the DFT2 genome ( Pye et al . , 2016b ) . We find that DFT2 cells express all five genomic MHC class I sequences , SahaI*35 ( Saha-UA ) , SahaI*90 ( Saha-UB ) SahaI*74/88 ( unassigned ) , SahaI*27 ( Saha-UC ) and SahaI*32 ( Saha-UD ) loci ( Table 1 and Figure 5 ) . We also identified a sixth expressed sequence ( SahaI*27\u20131 ) that differs from SahaI*27 by one non-synonymous substitution . Alignment of MHC class I sequences from DFT2 and DFT1 cells ( when treated with IFN\u03b3 ) show that across exon 2 of the heavy chain DFT1 and DFT2 share expression of four MHC class I alleles , SahaI*27 , SahaI*90 , SahaI*35 and SahaI*27\u20131 , with only SahaI*46 unique to DFT1 and SahaI*74/88 unique to DFT2 ( Table 1 ) . Using gene specific primers we were able to confirm that both DFT2 and DFT1 cells also express Saha-UK ( non-polymorphic ) ( Table 1 and Figure 2 ) . To assess the relative expression level of each of the classical MHC class I alleles in DFT2 cells , PCR amplicons were cloned and\u00a0>60 clones were sequenced , resulting in 61 classical MHC class I sequences from DFT2 . Of these sequences the most abundant is SahaI*27 , representing 22 ( 36% ) of the clones sequenced ( Table 1 ) . SahaI*27\u20131 and SahaI*35 were represented by 13 clones each ( 21% ) , while SahaI*74/88 and SahaI*90 were the least abundant , with 9 ( 15% ) and 4 ( 6% ) clones respectively . These results indicate that DFT2 cells do not express MHC class I alleles equally and that the dominant allele is SahaI*27 . Given the dominant expression of SahaI*27 by DFT2 cells we determined the prevalence of SahaI*27 and other MHC class I alleles in three host devils . Exon 2 of MHC class I transcripts were amplified from the mRNA of spleen samples from three devils infected with DFT2 ( TD_RV , TD_818 and TD_SN ) ( Table 1 ) . Alignment of the sequences demonstrates that the host devils share SahaI*32 ( Saha-UD ) , Saha-UK and SahaI*27 with DFT2 . In addition , TD_818 and TD_SN share SahaI*27\u20131 and either SahaI*35 or SahaI*90 with DFT2 ( Table 1 and Figure 5 ) . The MHC class I alleles that are expressed by DFT2 cells but not by the hosts are of particular interest as they are likely to be immunogenic upon cell transmission . SahaI*74/88 is unique to the DFT2 cell lines and differs from SahaI*27 and SahaI*27\u20131 found in the host animals by a single non-synonymous substitution at position 59 or position 76 , which are not predicted to interact with the TCR ( Figure 5B ) . The class I alleles with lower expression on DFT2 , SahaI*90 and SahaI*35 , share between 91 and 97% amino acid identity with the host alleles . To identify any further polymorphic sites that may have been missed when selecting clones for sequencing and to validate the sequences found in the hosts we used two approaches . First , we amplified and directly sequenced the MHC class I products from TD_RV , TD_818 and TD_SN to compare the chromatograms produced from sequencing pooled transcripts . This analysis did not reveal any additional polymorphic sites ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . Second , we used the sequences identified in Table 1 to conduct targeted searches of the genomes of TD_RV , TD_818 and TD_SN ( Stammnitz et al . , 2018 ) to confirm the presence of these alleles in genomic DNA . \n Here we show that DFT2 cells express classical and non-classical MHC class I molecules both in vitro and in vivo . This is in stark contrast to DFT1 , a likely older and more widespread contagious cancer in the Tasmanian devil , which has lost expression of MHC class I ( Siddle et al . , 2013 ) . However , DFT2 cells express the non-polymorphic , non-classical MHC class I molecule ( Saha-UK ) likely reducing the immunogenicity of these tumour cells . Further , the classical MHC class I allele with the highest expression in DFT2 cells is shared with host devils . Finally , we show that MHC class I expression varies among DFT2 tumours in vivo , suggesting that MHC class I negative subclones could emerge as DFT2 transmits more widely . Our results demonstrate that DFT2 cells express MHC class I molecules , in contrast to DFT1 and the contagious cancer circulating among dogs , CTVT . DFT1 cells lack surface expression of MHC class I due to loss of \u03b22m , TAP1 and TAP2 transcripts ( Siddle et al . , 2013 ) . However , loss of MHC class I in DFT1 is reversible upon treatment with the inflammatory cytokine IFN\u03b3 ( Siddle et al . , 2013 ) and a small number of individuals have been found to have a successful immune response against the tumour ( Pye et al . , 2016a ) . Similarly , CTVT is thought to down-regulate MHC expression during transmission , but expression can be upregulated on CTVT cells during a tumour specific immune response from the host ( Yang et al . , 1987 ) . In contrast , we show that DFT2 cells express cell surface \u03b22m molecules in addition to classical and non-classical class I heavy chains , indicating that functional MHC class I are present on the surface of DFT2 cells . The expression of a non-classical MHC class I molecule , Saha-UK , on DFT2 cells could reduce the immunogenicity of the tumour cells . Saha-UK is expressed in some DFT2 tumours in vivo and the Saha-UK heavy chain is expressed at similar levels to the three classical MHC class I genes ( amplified as a group ) in vitro . While antibodies specific for Saha-UD are not available , RT-PCR indicates it is also expressed , but at a very low level compared to Saha-UK . Non-classical MHC class I molecules can be inhibitory ligands for NK receptors and some human cancers down-regulate classical MHC class I and overexpress non-classical MHC class I to avoid a cytotoxic immune response ( Kochan et al . , 2013 ) . While the function of Saha-UK and Saha-UD are not known ( Siddle et al . , 2009 ) , neither are highly polymorphic ( Saha-UK is monomorphic [Siddle et al . , 2010] ) and unlikely to elicit an allogeneic T cell response in host devils . However , further investigation is needed to determine the function of these molecules and the functional classification of Tasmanian devil MHC class I molecules as \u2018classical\u2019 or \u2018non-classical\u2019 . DFT2 cells also express classical MHC class I alleles belonging to the Saha-UA , -UB and -UC loci . Of these classical MHC class I alleles , SahaI*27 is the most abundant in DFT2 cells and is also found in the three host devils , reducing the immunogenicity of DFT2 cells in these animals . The primers designed in this study should amplify all known DFT1 and DFT2 MHC class I alleles with equal efficiency , suggesting that this allele represents an MHC class I locus with dominant expression . As well as being found in the host devils , this allele is highly prevalent in at least one devil population ( Lane et al . , 2012 ) and the high expression levels in DFT2 may be facilitating tolerance of the tumour in this population of devils . The similarity of the MHC class I alleles between DFT2 and host devils may reflect a shared geographical range and genotype pool to the cancer founder's ( Stammnitz et al . , 2018 ) . Thus , the frequency of this allele among the wider population may impact the ability of DFT2 to spread further . The heterogenic expression of MHC class I molecules in DFT2 biopsies suggests that MHC class I expression is not fixed and may be gradually lost in DFT2 . While some MHC class I alleles are shared between DFT2 and its hosts , the tumour does have a number of unique alleles . SahaI*74/88 differs to SahaI*27 by only one amino acid that is not predicted to interact with the TCR , but SahaI*90 and SahaI*35 have a number of unique sites when compared to host MHC class I alleles . While these alleles have lower expression on DFT2 than SahaI*27 , their presence may still initiate an immune response in some host animals , providing a selective pressure for MHC class I loss . It is possible that , like single organism tumours , DFT2 is undergoing immunoediting ( Dunn et al . , 2002 ) , which can operate to down-regulate specific MHC class I alleles that are immunogenic ( McGranahan et al . , 2017 ) or select for mutations that remove or modulate total MHC class I expression . However , while four of the six primary DFT2 tumours examined have CD3 positive cells in the tumour mass , which may indicate an immune response , the infiltration is notably present in DFT2_812 , which is negative for classical MHC class I and could be expected to be CD3 negative . Thus , further detailed analysis is needed to define the host immune response to DFT2 and its role in shaping tumour evolution . While DFT1 cells currently circulating in the population are MHC class I negative , it is possible that DFT1 down regulated MHC class I expression after the tumour became transmissible and that initial transmission events were among individuals that shared prevalent MHC class I alleles . This is supported by previous studies that have found reduced polymorphism in devil MHC and microsatellite loci ( Jones et al . , 2007; Siddle et al . , 2007 ) . In addition , a hemizygous deletion of \u03b22m has recently been identified in a DFT1 cell line , perhaps indicating past selective pressure for MHC class I loss in this older transmissible tumour ( Stammnitz et al . , 2018 ) . Similarly , CTVT is thought to have emerged in an old world dog and the genetic structure of a dog pack would have favoured the emergence of CTVT ( Murgia et al . , 2006 ) . However , the presence or absence of MHC antigens is likely not singly responsible for determining the ability of the host to respond to the tumour . DFT2 may also be manipulating its microenvironment by release of immune suppressive cytokines , such as Transforming Growth Factor\u03b2 , which can drive metastasis ( Tauriello et al . , 2018 ) and in conjunction with\u00a0PD1/PD-L1 interactions can inhibit and exclude T cells from a tumour ( Mariathasan et al . , 2018 ) . In addition , recruitment of T regulatory cells ( Curiel et al . , 2004; James et al . , 2010 ) or immunosuppressive myeloid cells ( Almand et al . , 2001 ) can also negatively impact the T cell responses to tumours . DFT1 is now at least 21 years old and CTVT is predicted to be over 10 , 000 years old ( Murchison et al . , 2014 ) , whereas DFT2 was first discovered in 2014 and is most likely a recently emerged tumour ( Pye et al . , 2016b ) . As such , DFT2 provides an opportunity to study the early evolution of a contagious cancer . The emergence of a contagious cancer that can transmit while maintaining MHC class I expression indicates that loss of MHC is not necessary for transmission , but as the tumour encounters the immune system of genetically disparate hosts subclones that have down-regulated MHC may be selected . Our results predict that loss of MHC class I is already occurring , perhaps due to structural mutations or epigenetic changes . Loss of MHC antigens could allow rapid dissemination of DFT2 through the population , impacting an already vulnerable species . \n Six wild Tasmanian devils were either trapped or found dead from road trauma or other causes . Tissue biopsies and fine needle aspirates were either collected post mortem or from live devils that were subsequently released . All animal procedures were performed under a Standard Operating Procedure approved by the General Manager , Natural and Cultural Heritage Division , Tasmanian Government Department of Primary Industries , Parks , Water and the Environment or under University of Tasmania Animal Ethics Committee Permit A0014976 . Sample information is shown in Supplementary file 1 . Tumour and spleen samples were collected as described in Supplementary file 1 and were formalin fixed ( 10% neutral buffered formalin ) and then paraffin embedded . The DFT1 cell line , DFT1_4906 , and fibroblast cell line , Fibroblasts_Salem , have been described elsewhere ( Murchison et al . , 2012 ) . Three cell lines derived from DFT2 primary tumours ( DFT2_RV , DFT2_SN and DFT2_TD549 ) were established from fine needle aspirates collected in culture medium and cultured at 35\u00b0C and 5% CO2 . Cell lines DFT1_4906 , DFT2_RV and DFT2_SN were grown in RPMI 1640 with L-glutamine ( Gibco; ThermoFisher Scientific ) with 10% heat inactivated foetal bovine serum ( FBS ) ( Gibco; ThermoFisher Scientific ) and penicillin/streptomycin ( 100 units/ml penicillin and 0 . 1 mg/ml streptomycin ) ( Gibco; ThermoFisher Scientific ) . Fibroblasts_Salem was cultured in DMEM with high glucose and L-glutamine ( Gibco; ThermoFisher Scientific ) with 10% FBS ( Gibco; ThermoFisher Scientific ) and penicillin/streptomycin ( 100 units/ml penicillin and 0 . 1 mg/ml streptomycin ) ( Gibco; ThermoFisher Scientific ) . Cells were passaged at 80\u201390% confluency at a ratio of 1:3 using trypsin ( 0 . 05% ) to detach cells . DFT1 cells were treated with recombinant devil IFN\u03b3 derived from a transfected cell line ( CHO_SahaIFNy ) as previously described ( Siddle et al . , 2013 ) . Cells were incubated on ice with anti-devil \u03b22m antibody supernatant for 30 min , followed by secondary antibody ( 2 \u03bcg/ml goat anti-Mouse IgG ( H\u00a0+\u00a0L ) Alexa Fluor 488 Conjugate; ThermoFisher Scientific ) for 30 min . The specificity of the antibody was confirmed by incubating 50 \u03bcg/ml recombinant devil \u03b22m protein ( Siddle et al . , 2013 ) with anti-devil \u03b22m antibody on ice for 30 min prior to staining . Cells were analysed on BD FACSCalibur and data analysed using FlowJo software . MHC class I transcripts were aligned and translated into protein sequences using CLC workbench . Two regions were identified , in the \u03b11 domain and the \u03b13 domain , where the amino acid sequenced of the Saha-UA , -UB and \u2013UC sequences are highly similar to each other , with only one amino acid change , but contain low similarity to Saha-UK and Saha-UD . Using these sequences the following peptides were synthesised for immunisations , WMEKVQDVDPGYWE against Saha-UA , -UB and -UC and RITHRTHPDGKVTL against Saha-UK . Mice were immunised subcutaneously with a mixture of GERBU adjuvant and 50 \u03bcg of either WMEKVQDVDPGYWE-C or RITHRTHPDGKVTL-C coupled to diphtheria toxoid via the N-terminal cysteine . Three days later spleen lymphocytes were fused with the SP2 cell line using PEG as fuseogen . Hybridomas were selected based on reactivity in ELISA against both N- and C-terminal coupled peptide and subsequently screened against Tasmanian devil fibroblast cells and verified against recombinant expressed MHC class I by western blot as described below . Cell pellets were lysed on ice for 30 min at 4 \u00d7 107 cells/ml lysis buffer ( 150 mM NaCl , 100 mM TrisCl , 1 mM MgCL2 and 1% digitonin ) and the lysates clarified . 10 \u03bcl of cell lysate was added to 15 \u03bcl loading buffer ( 500 \u03bcl 2X Lamelli sample buffer , 50 \u03bcl \u03b2-mercaptoethanol and 450 \u03bcl dd-H2O ) and heated to 95\u00b0C 10 min . Samples were run on 12% ProtoGel ( National Diagnostics Protogel 30% ) using Laemmli buffers and Fisherbrand Vertical Gel Tank . Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose blotting membrane ( Amersham Protran GE Healthcare Life Sciences ) in transfer buffer ( 25 mM Tris , 190 mM glycine and 20% ( w/v ) methanol ) using Mini Trans-Blot Cell ( Bio-Rad ) . The membrane was blocked for 45 min with 150 mM NaCl , 0 . 1% Tween 20 , 4% milk powder , 50 mM TrisCL , pH 8 and incubated with primary antibodies at 4\u00b0C overnight , washed with 150 mM NaCl , 0 . 1% Tween 20 , 4% milk powder , 50 mM TrisCL , pH 8 , and incubated with secondary antibody ( IRDye 680RD Goat anti-Mouse IgG ( H\u00a0+\u00a0L ) ) for 30 min at room temperature before washing as above . Membranes were visualised using the Li-cor Odyssey scanner . The specificity of the antibodies was determined using full length recombinant devil MHC class I heavy chain proteins for Saha-UC ( SahaI*27 ) and Saha-UK . SahaI*27 and Saha-UK were amplified from devil fibroblast cDNA using primer Saha349 and Saha350 ( Saha-UC ) and Saha335 and Saha351 ( Saha-UK ) ( Supplementary file 2 ) . The subsequent amplicons were cloned into the pET22b+ vector ( Novagen ) and transformed into Rosetta pLysS cells ( Novagen ) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions and the transcripts were sequenced in both directions . Bacterial colonies containing pET22B+-SahaUC and pET22B+-SahaUK were cultured to OD600 0 . 6 and protein expression was induced with 1 mM Isopropyl \u03b2-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside ( IPTG ) . Bacterial cells were pelleted and resuspended in solubilisation buffer ( 8 M Urea , 50 mM Mes pH 6 . 5 , 0 . 1 mM EDTA and 1 mM DTT ) and the lysates clarified . The total protein in lysates was measured using Bradford Reagent following the manufacturers instructions . 20 \u03bcg protein was loaded onto a 12% gel and electrophoresis and blotting were performed as described above . Membranes were incubated with the undiluted supernatant from primary antibodies \u03b1-UK_15-29-1 and \u03b1-UA/UB/UC_15-25-18 at 4\u00b0C overnight . DFT1 and DFT2 primary tumours were fixed in 10% ( mass/vol ) PBS-buffered formalin solution for 2 to 4 d . Tissues were processed and embedded in paraffin blocks and cut onto coated slides at 4\u20135 \u03bcm thickness . Sections were deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated through graded alcohol . Antigen retrieval was performed by water bath ( 95\u00b0C ) in citrate buffer solution ( 10 mM citric acid , 0 . 05% Tween20 pH 6 ) for 40 min followed by cooling for 15 min . Endogenous peroxidase was blocked by incubation of slides with 0 . 3% H2O2 ( Sigma Aldrich ) and non-specific protein binding was blocked with 10% ( mass/vol ) goat serum . Sections were incubated with primary antibody ( list of antibodies in Supplementary file 3 ) at 4\u00b0C overnight . Peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody ( Envision kit; Dako ) was used to detect primary antibody binding following the manufacturers instructions . Sections were counterstained with haematoxylin ( vector hematoxylin nuclear counterstain Gill\u2019s Formula ) for 4 min , differentiated in 2% ( mass/vol ) acetic acid and blued in 0 . 2% ( mass/vol ) ammoniated water . Sections were dehydrated through graded alcohol to xylene and cover-slipped . Images were captured using the Nikon Eclipse 400 microscope , Retiga 2000R camera and Q-capture pro seven computer software . The Nucleospin RNA II kit ( Macherey-Nagel ) was used to extract RNA from cell lines according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions . 1 \u03bcg of RNA was reverse transcribed to cDNA using Thermofischer Scientific RevertAid Premium Reverse Transcriptase ( 200 U ) with 1X RT buffer , 0 . 5 mM dNTPs , 20 pm oligodT primer ( Promega ) and nuclease free H2O to a total volume of 20 \u03bcl . Primer set one was designed to amplify the classical MHC class I ( Saha-UA , -UB and \u2013UC ) by aligning all available MHC class I sequences from the Tasmanian devil and embedding primers in conserved regions . Primer set one amplifies the three loci as a group , due to the high level of sequence similarity between the classical class I genes , gene specific PCRs for these loci were not possible . Primer set two was designed to amplify the non-classical MHC class I ( Saha-UK ) . All primers are listed in Supplementary file 2 . RT-qPCR was carried out for RPL13A , \u03b22m , classical MHC class I ( Saha-UA , -UB and -UC ) and non-classical MHC class I ( Saha-UK ) on the StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR system ( ThermoFisher Scientific ) using PrecisionPLUS qPCR MasterMix ( Primerdesign ) with primers at 5 mM each following the cycling protocol; 95\u00b0C 2 min , followed by 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 15 s and 60\u00b0C for 1 min . RPL13A was used as the reference gene and data analysis was performed using the relative standard curve method for comparing gene expression ( DFT1_4906\u00a0=\u00a01 ) . All cDNA samples were tested in triplicate and controls with no cDNA template were included . DFT2 at four dilutions ( 250 , 50 , 10 , 2 and 0 . 4 ng ) was used to create a standard curve of amplification for RPL13A with an R2 of 0 . 999 and 97 . 14% efficiency . Recombinant DNA at five dilutions ( 0 . 2 , 0 . 04 , 0 . 008 , 0 . 00016 and 0 . 000032 ) was used to create a standard curve of amplification of MHC class I Saha-UK and MHC class I Saha-UA , UB and UC with R2 values of 0 . 991 and 0 . 997% and 105 . 2 and 111 . 4% efficiency respectively . IFN\u03b3 treated DFT1 ( 4906 ) cells at five dilutions ( 250 , 50 , 10 , 2 and 0 . 4 ng ) was used to create a standard curve of amplification for \u03b22m with an R2 of 0 . 994 and 91 . 4% efficiency . The Nucleospin RNA II kit ( Macherey-Nagel ) was used to extract RNA from DFT2 cell lines , DFT1 cells after treatment with IFN\u03b3 , and host samples ( TD_RV , TD_SN and TD_818 ) . The NucleoSpin totalRNA FFPE kit ( Macherey-Nagel ) was used to extract RNA from formalin fixed tumour tissues according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions . 1 \u03bcg of RNA was reverse transcribed to cDNA as described previously . Three primer sets were used to amplify all classical and non-classical MHC class I alleles . Primer set one was used to amplify Saha-UA , -UB and \u2013UC products as a group , primer sets 2 and 3 were used to amplify Saha-UK and Saha-UD genes specifically ( for PCR conditions see Supplementary file 4 ) . All products were purified using NucleoSpin Gel and PCR Clean-up ( Macherey-Nagel ) , cloned into a pJET plasmid ( CloneJET; ThermoFisher Scientific ) . Plasmid DNA from individual clones was isolated and sequenced using T7 primer . PCR , cloning and sequencing was performed in triplicate for the DFT2 cells and duplicate for the spleen samples . For primer set 1 between 15 and 65 clones were sequenced for each PCR , for primer sets 2 and 3 between 4 and 6 clones were sequenced . To assess the relative abundance of each of the classical MHC class I alleles within DFT2 cells 65 clones were isolated and sequenced using primer set 1 . To validate the MHC class I alleles , Saha-UA , -UB and -UC genes were amplified using primer set one as described above and resulting PCR products ( containing all MHC class I alleles for these genes ) were sequenced directly using these primers . The resulting chromatograms were used to identify polymorphic sites in the transcripts and to confirm the validity of alleles . In addition , MHC class I alleles for RV , 818 and SN were searched against genomes generated for these animals ( Stammnitz et al . , 2018 ) to validate their presence in the genome . All sequences were quality checked and analysed in CLC Genomic Workbench . Residues in the MHC class I sequences predicted to interact with the peptide or the TCR were identified by aligning to HLA-A2 ( Bjorkman et al . , 1987 ) .", "headings": ["Abstract", "Introduction", "Results", "Discussion", "Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods"], "keywords": ["immunology and inflammation", "cancer biology"], "id": "elife-35314-v1"}
{"lay_summary": "Sitting in your car , about to drive home after a long day at work , you realize you have no idea which way to go: you recognize where you are right now , and you remember the name of the street your house is on , but you cannot figure out how to get there . This spatial disorientation happens to people with damage to a brain region called the retrosplenial cortex , whose role and inner workings remain poorly understood . Recent evidence has shown that this area contains \u2018low-rheobase\u2019 neurons which are not seen anywhere else in the brain , but what do these neurons do ? Brennan , Jedrasiak-Cape , Kailasa et al . decided to explore the role of these neurons , focusing on the brain regions they are connected to . Experiments were conducted in mice using optogenetics , a technique that activates neurons using pulses of light . This revealed that brain areas involved in processing information about direction and position preferentially communicate with low-rheobase neurons rather than with nearby , more standard neurons in the retrosplenial cortex . The way these spatial signals are sent to the low-rheobase neurons allows these cells to \u2018calculate\u2019 how fast a mouse is turning its head using only information about which direction the mouse is facing . Essentially , this neuron can turn directional compass-like signals into a gyroscope signal that can track both direction and speed of head movement . These unique neurons may therefore be ideally suited to combine information about direction and space , suggesting that they may have evolved specifically to support spatial navigation . Individuals with Alzheimer\u2019s disease show exactly the same type of spatial disorientation as individuals with direct damage to the retrosplenial cortex . This region is also one of the first to show altered activity in Alzheimer\u2019s disease . Exploring whether these unique retrosplenial neurons and their communication patterns are altered in Alzheimer\u2019s disease models could help to understand and potentially treat this debilitating condition .", "article": "The granular retrosplenial cortex ( RSG ) is critical for both spatial and non-spatial behaviors , but the underlying neural codes remain poorly understood . Here , we use optogenetic circuit mapping in mice to reveal a double dissociation that allows parallel circuits in superficial RSG to process disparate inputs . The anterior thalamus and dorsal subiculum , sources of spatial information , strongly and selectively recruit small low-rheobase ( LR ) pyramidal cells in RSG . In contrast , neighboring regular-spiking ( RS ) cells are preferentially controlled by claustral and anterior cingulate inputs , sources of mostly non-spatial information . Precise sublaminar axonal and dendritic arborization within RSG layer 1 , in particular , permits this parallel processing . Observed thalamocortical synaptic dynamics enable computational models of LR neurons to compute the speed of head rotation , despite receiving head direction inputs that do not explicitly encode speed . Thus , parallel input streams identify a distinct principal neuronal subtype ideally positioned to support spatial orientation computations in the RSG . \n Activity in the granular retrosplenial cortex ( RSG ) is correlated with a wide variety of behaviors , including spatial navigation , learning , memory , fear conditioning , imagination , and planning for the future ( Alexander et al . , 2020; Alexander and Nitz , 2017; Chang et al . , 2020; Chrastil , 2018; Hinman et al . , 2018; Mao et al . , 2018; Miller et al . , 2021; Miller et al . , 2019 ) . The RSG is also among the most densely connected regions of the brain , integrating inputs from a bevy of cortical and subcortical sources and serving as part of the default mode network ( Greicius et al . , 2009; Kaboodvand et al . , 2018; Liu et al . , 2019; Whitesell et al . , 2021 ) . While these anatomical connections are well-documented ( Van Groen and Wyss , 2003; van Groen and Wyss , 1990; Whitesell et al . , 2021; Wyss and Van Groen , 1992 ) , few studies have examined their functional nature ( Nitzan et al . , 2020; Yamawaki et al . , 2019b; Yamawaki et al . , 2019a; Yamawaki et al . , 2016a ) , and cell-type specificity has yet to be sufficiently explored . Such knowledge is critical to develop a mechanistic understanding of how the RSG integrates information from multiple sources to carry out its spatial and non-spatial functions . Cortical regions , including the RSG , receive inputs from one or more thalamic nuclei ( Herkenham , 1986; Herkenham , 1980; Jones , 2001; Jones , 1998; Peters , 1979; Van Groen and Wyss , 1995 ) . Thalamic relay cells ( Clasc\u00e1 et al . , 2012 ) are grouped into three distinct classes: core , intralaminar , and paralaminar/ventral midline ( matrix ) nuclei ( Hanbery and Jasper , 1953; Herkenham , 1986; Jones , 2001; Jones , 1998; Morison and Dempsey , 1941; Rubio-Garrido et al . , 2009 ) . Thalamic matrix nuclei project predominantly to layer 1 of many cortical regions ( Herkenham , 1986; Herkenham , 1980 ) , resulting in subtype-specific activation of cortical inhibitory ( Anastasiades et al . , 2021; Cruikshank et al . , 2012; Delevich et al . , 2015 ) and excitatory neurons ( Collins et al . , 2018; Cruikshank et al . , 2012; Guo et al . , 2018; Rodriguez-Moreno et al . , 2020; Rubio-Garrido et al . , 2009; Van der Werf et al . , 2002; Yamawaki et al . , 2019b ) . Matrix thalamocortical ( TC ) inputs from the anterior thalamus , which contains the highest proportion of head direction cells in the brain ( Taube and Bassett , 2003 ) , influence layer 5 pyramidal cells in RSG ( Yamawaki et al . , 2019b ) . However , potential subtype-specific responses and their functional impact on the encoding of directional information in RSG have yet to be examined . The cortex , including the RSG , also receives widespread inputs from the densely connected claustrum ( Brown et al . , 2017; Crick and Koch , 2005; Goll et al . , 2015; Jackson et al . , 2018; Kim et al . , 2016; Narikiyo et al . , 2020; Wang et al . , 2017; White and Mathur , 2018 ) . As with TC signaling , the claustrum innervates both excitatory ( da Costa et al . , 2010; Narikiyo et al . , 2020 ) and inhibitory ( Jackson et al . , 2018; Narikiyo et al . , 2020; Salerno et al . , 1984 ) neurons via precise laminar targeting ( Wang et al . , 2017 ) and projects to many of the same cortical regions as the thalamus ( Burman et al . , 2011 ) . Claustrocortical ( ClaC ) projections are thought to regulate complex functions ( Crick and Koch , 2005; Goll et al . , 2015; Jackson et al . , 2018; Kitanishi and Matsuo , 2017; Narikiyo et al . , 2020; Renouard et al . , 2015; Smith et al . , 2012; White and Mathur , 2018 ) , including the coordination and amplification of correlated signals across cortical regions ( Kim et al . , 2016; Smith et al . , 2012; Smythies et al . , 2012 ) . Surprisingly , the RSG is one of few regions that does not return reciprocal connections to the claustrum ( Zingg et al . , 2018 ) . Despite the unique unidirectional nature of this connection , no studies have investigated the functional nature or subtype-specificity of ClaC inputs to RSG neurons . Each cortical region also receives inputs from select other cortical areas . The RSG receives direct innervation from the secondary motor cortex ( Yamawaki et al . , 2016a ) , contralateral RSG ( Sempere-Ferr\u00e0ndez et al . , 2018; Wyss et al . , 1990 ) , and anterior cingulate cortex ( ACC; Van Groen and Wyss , 2003; van Groen and Wyss , 1990 ) , among others . The RSG and ACC , in particular , have been implicated in several shared limbic and cognitive functions , including fear conditioning ( Frankland et al . , 2004; Han et al . , 2003; Yamawaki et al . , 2019a; Yamawaki et al . , 2019b ) , but the cellular targets of ACC inputs to RSG have not been identified . Thalamic , claustral , and cortical inputs all converge in the RSG , but whether they do so via parallel or integrative control of target excitatory neurons remains unknown . Within the RSG , the superficial layers contain two subtypes of principal excitatory pyramidal neurons that have strikingly distinct physiology , morphology , and computational capabilities: the low-rheobase ( LR ) neuron and the regular-spiking ( RS ) neuron ( Brennan et al . , 2020; Kurotani et al . , 2013; Yousuf et al . , 2020 ) . Here , we use channelrhodopsin ( ChR2 ) -assisted circuit mapping ( CRACM ) to study the subtype-specific circuits formed by anterior thalamic , claustral , anterior cingulate , and dorsal subicular inputs to the RSG . Our results reveal a double dissociation in the precise organization of afferent axons and principal cell dendrites that can support parallel processing in superficial RSG . Specifically , we find that anterior thalamus and dorsal subiculum preferentially control LR neurons , whereas claustrum and anterior cingulate control RS cells . We show that the synaptic dynamics of thalamic inputs allow for the robust encoding of angular speed by LR cell models , even though these inputs only explicitly contain information about head direction , not speed . Together , our results suggest that LR neurons are ideally positioned to contribute to the initial spatial orientation computations performed in superficial RSG . \n Layer 3 of the granular retrosplenial cortex ( RSG ) contains two types of principal pyramidal neurons: the low-rheobase ( LR ) neuron and the regular-spiking ( RS ) neuron ( Brennan et al . , 2020; Kurotani et al . , 2013; Yousuf et al . , 2020 ) . Using whole-cell patch clamp recordings , we again distinguished LR from RS neurons by their unique intrinsic properties , predominantly the low rheobase , high input resistance , lack of adaptation , and narrow spike width ( Figure 1A\u2013C , Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1 , Supplementary file 1\u00a0-\u00a0Table\u00a01 , and Supplementary file 1\u00a0-\u00a0Table\u00a02; Brennan et al . , 2020 ) . We used channelrhodopsin-assisted circuit mapping ( CRACM ) to interrogate inputs to these two cell types . Consistent with previous studies ( Odagiri et al . , 2011; Van Groen and Wyss , 2003; van Groen and Wyss , 1990; Yamawaki et al . , 2019b ) , virus injections into the anterodorsal and anteroventral thalamic nuclei ( ADAV ) resulted in ChR2-eYFP expression in thalamocortical ( TC ) axons and terminals predominantly in layer 1a ( L1a; the most superficial part of layer 1 ) and in layer 3 ( L3 ) of superficial RSG ( Figure 1D ) . To test whether these thalamocortical inputs target the LR and RS neurons in layer 3 , we stimulated the thalamic axons and terminals with 1 ms LED pulses at a 10 Hz frequency for 1 s at high LED power over the cell body of the patched neurons ( Figure 1E; see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods ) . From resting membrane potentials of approximately \u221265 mV , LR neurons were strongly driven past spike threshold by these thalamic inputs while RS neurons exhibited far smaller EPSPs ( Figure 1F ) . To quantify the impact of TC inputs on LR and RS spike rates , we next depolarized the cells until they were spiking at 10\u201325 Hz and delivered a single LED pulse ( see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods ) . To rule out effects of feed-forward inhibition in these experiments , the GABAA antagonist , picrotoxin ( 50 \u00b5M ) , was added to the bath . Compared to their baseline activity , this stimulation evoked a significant increase in spiking in LR neurons ( p=0 . 002 , Wilcoxon rank sum test ) but not RS neurons ( p=0 . 19 , Wilcoxon rank sum test; Figure 1G ) . The LR neurons thus had a significantly larger increase in spike rate evoked by the optical pulse than RS neurons ( p=0 . 0012 , Wilcoxon rank sum test; Figure 1H ) . This suggests that LR neurons receive stronger activation from TC inputs than their neighboring L3 RS neurons . LR neurons are morphologically distinct from their neighboring RS neurons ( Brennan et al . , 2020; Kurotani et al . , 2013; Yousuf et al . , 2020 ) . Given the precise laminar pattern of anterior thalamic inputs to RSG ( Figure 1D and Figure 2B ) , we next investigated the overlap between anterior thalamic afferents and the dendritic morphologies of reconstructed LR ( n\u00a0=\u00a010 ) and RS ( n\u00a0=\u00a05 ) cells ( see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods ) . Apical dendrites of LR neurons were most densely localized to L1a , with basal dendrites remaining confined to L3 ( Figure 2C ) . In contrast , RS apical dendrites rarely entered L1a , instead existing in the deeper subdivisions of layer 1 ( L1b/c ) , with basal dendrites primarily in upper layer 5 ( L5; Figure 2D ) . Projection density analysis showed localization of ADAV axons and terminal arbors in L1a and weakly in L3 ( Figure 2C&D ) . Thus , dendrites of LR , but not RS , cells selectively co-localize within layers 1a and 3 with ADAV TC afferents ( Figure 2C&D ) . This anatomical colocalization of LR , but not RS , dendrites with TC axons coupled with the increase in LR , but not RS , spiking in response to TC optical stimulation indicates that the anterior thalamic-retrosplenial circuit at least partially obeys Peters\u2019 rule , which states that neuronal populations with anatomically overlapping axonal and dendritic arbors are more likely to show functional connectivity Peters , 1979; Peters and Feldman , 1976 . To further verify this , we examined the responses of L3 LR and RS neurons to ADAV input at L1a , where the highest projection density of ADAV inputs exist ( see Methods ) . When delivering 1 ms high LED power light pulses , we indeed found that LR neurons had a significantly larger excitatory postsynaptic potential ( EPSP ) amplitude in response to the L1a LED stimulation compared to RS cell responses ( p=0 . 0185 , Wilcoxon rank sum test; Figure 2E ) . Notably , in response to layer one stimulation , LR cells also showed significantly larger EPSP amplitudes compared to L5 RS neurons ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1 ) , which have been previously shown to respond to TC input ( Yamawaki et al . , 2019b ) . This suggests that LR neurons , rather than layer 3 or 5 RS neurons , are the predominant RSG cell type receiving and processing head direction inputs from the anterior thalamus . To further examine the effects of lamination of anterior thalamic inputs to LR and RS neurons on their resulting responses , we conducted a high-resolution protocol that used minimum thresholded LED power to optically stimulate every 20\u201330 \u00b5m along the neuron\u2019s longitudinal axis ( Figure 2F; see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods ) . We found that LR neurons have the largest EPSP amplitude when the LED pulse is targeting layer 1a , corresponding with the peak projection density of ADAV axons and terminal arbors at this lamina . LR response amplitude then decreases as the LED moves away from the pia before reaching no response at the layer 1/2 border . As LED stimulation entered layer 3 , the LR EPSP amplitude increased , consistent with the increase in projection density of the ADAV axons and terminal arbors , before again decreasing until their response amplitude reached 0 mV in layer 5 ( Figure 2F ) . In contrast , the RS neuron showed much smaller EPSP amplitude with no significant variation in response across the layers ( Figure 2F&G ) . To verify this functional sublaminar correlation between thalamocortical axons and pyramidal cell dendrites , we ran a population analysis comparing the EPSP amplitudes within LR and RS cell groups from all layers relative to L1/2 , which represents our minimum projection density of ADAV inputs in the superficial layers . We found that within the LR cell population , LR cells have significantly larger responses at L1a ( p=0 . 00001 ) and cell body ( p=0 . 0006 ) compared to L1/2 ( paired t-test; Figure 2G ) . This lamination of functional responses in the LR population precisely aligns with the lamination of ADAV axons and terminal arbors within these superficial layers . When stimulating in layer 5 , there was no significant difference between EPSP amplitude at L1/2 and L5sup ( p=0 . 420 ) , while L5dp responses were significantly smaller than those at L1/2 ( p=0 . 0462; Figure 2G ) , as would be expected given the complete lack of LR dendrites in L5 . In contrast , RS EPSP amplitudes at layers 1a , cell body , L5sup , and L5dp did not differ from responses at L1/2 ( p>0 . 05 for all; paired t-test ) , indicating that there is no significant lamination of functional responses to thalamic inputs in the RS population , likely due to their relative lack of response to these inputs in general ( Figure 2G ) . These relationships persisted when inhibition blocker picrotoxin ( 50 \u00b5M ) or sodium channel blocker TTX ( 1 \u00b5M ) +4 AP ( 100 \u00b5M ) were added to the bath ( data not shown; see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods ) . Thus , the connectivity between anterior thalamic TC arbors and L3 principal neurons in RSG highlights a circuit that depends on the precise sublaminar colocalization of both local principal cells\u2019 dendrites and incoming thalamocortical axons . This demonstrates that LR neurons are uniquely anatomically adapted to respond to incoming inputs from the anterior thalamus , where\u00a0~\u00a060% of neurons are head direction cells ( Taube , 1995; Taube and Bassett , 2003 ) , due to a precise overlap of their apical dendrites with the dense thalamic axons and terminals in the uppermost sublamina of L1 ( L1a ) . Two other main sources of input to RSG are the claustrum ( CLA; Van Groen and Wyss , 2003; van Groen and Wyss , 1990 ) and anterior cingulate cortex ( ACC; Shibata and Naito , 2008; Van Groen and Wyss , 2003; van Groen and Wyss , 1990 ) . Both claustrocortical ( ClaC ) and ACC corticocortical ( CC ) projections have been anatomically shown to exhibit distinct laminar organization within its target cortical layers ( Van Groen and Wyss , 2003; Vogt and Miller , 1983; Wang et al . , 2017 ) , but the precise functional targets of claustral and cingulate inputs to superficial RSG have , to our knowledge , never been examined . To address this , we next used CRACM , this time to examine CLA inputs to RSG LR and RS neurons and then compared these projections to RSG thalamic inputs . ChR2 injections into CLA ( Figure 3A ) resulted in expression of CLA axons and terminals in layers 1 c , 2 , and 5 ( Figure 3B ) . This expression pattern is distinct from the thalamic expression localized to layers 1a and 3 ( Figure 2B\u2013D ) . Dendritic lamination plots of LR and RS dendrites and projection density plots of CLA axons and terminal arbors show that RS , but not LR , apical dendrites anatomically overlap with CLA arbors in superficial layers 1 c and two and upper layer 5 ( Figure 3D ) . Using the same targeted optogenetic stimulation approach as previously described ( see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods ) , we found that RS neurons have significantly larger responses to CLA input compared to LR neurons when stimulated at layer 1/2 ( p=0 . 0000035 , Wilcoxon rank sum test; Figure 3E ) , the area of the strongest superficial projection density of CLA arbors . Similarly , layer 5 RS neurons exhibited significantly larger EPSP amplitudes in response to CLA inputs compared to LR cells ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . This again indicates that while LR neurons may be optimally positioned to receive thalamic input , RS neurons in both RSG L3 and L5 are instead the primary recipients of CLA inputs . To further examine the lamination of ClaC inputs to LR and RS neurons and their resulting responses , we again conducted the high-resolution CRACM protocol using minimum LED power ( Figure 3F; see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods ) . We found that RS neurons have the largest EPSP amplitude when the LED pulse is stimulating both layer 1c and 5sup and weakest EPSP amplitude at layer 1a , corresponding with , respectively , the strongest and the weakest projection density of CLA afferents at these laminar locations . In contrast , the complementary LR cell had no response to LED stimulation at any of the laminar locations ( Figure 3F ) . Population analysis showed that within the RS cell population , RS cells have significantly larger responses at L1/2 ( p=0 . 00725 ) and L5sup ( p=0 . 0301 ) compared to those at L1a ( paired t-test; Figure 3G ) . This lamination of functional responses in the RS cell precisely aligns with the lamination of ClaC axons and terminal arbors within these layers . In contrast , LR EPSP amplitudes across all layers were much lower in magnitude and did not differ from responses at L1a ( p>0 . 05 for all; paired t-test; Figure 3G ) , indicating no significant lamination of functional responses to ClaC inputs in the LR population . These relationships persisted when inhibition blocker picrotoxin ( 50 \u00b5M ) or sodium channel blocker TTX ( 1 \u00b5M ) +4 AP ( 100 \u00b5M ) were added to the bath ( data not shown; see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods ) . Using the same CRACM approach to examine ACC inputs to RSG ( Figure 4A ) , we found that corticocortical inputs from the anterior cingulate target L1b/c and , to a lesser extent , L5 ( Figure 4B ) , partially resembling the laminar pattern seen with CLA arbors ( Figure 3B ) and overlapping precisely with RS , but not LR , dendrites ( Figure 3C&D ) . Indeed , when stimulating ACC arbors at L1/2 , RS cells had significantly larger EPSP amplitudes compared to LR cells ( p=0 . 0019 ) . When examining the lamination of these inputs with higher spatial resolution , we found that RS cells have the largest EPSP response to ACC inputs at L1/2 , while the same minimum LED stimulation power elicits no response in layer 1a ( Figure 4F ) . Population analysis of RS cells revealed significantly larger responses to optogenetic stimulation of ACC inputs at the L1/2 ( p=0 . 000037 ) and cell body ( p=0 . 000525 ) compared to L1a stimulation ( Figure 4G ) , reflecting the precise overlap of ACC arbors and RS dendrites . In contrast , the much smaller LR EPSP amplitudes across all layers did not differ from responses at L1a ( p>0 . 05 for all; paired t-test; Figure 4G ) . Again , the same results were seen when inhibition blocker picrotoxin ( 50 \u00b5M ) or sodium channel blocker TTX ( 1 \u00b5M ) +4 AP ( 100 \u00b5M ) were added to the bath ( data not shown; see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods ) . Thus , both claustrocortical and corticocortical inputs to RSG target RS apical dendrites at the lower divisions of L1 ( L1c and L1b/c , respectively ) , whereas thalamocortical inputs preferentially target the apical dendrites of LR cells in upper L1 ( L1a ) . This again indicates that parallel circuits in RSG process TC versus ClaC and CC information , and this parallel processing is enabled by precise sublaminar organization of afferent axons and layer three principal cell apical dendrites . Previous work has shown that dorsal subiculum ( DS ) , which serves to transmit allocentric spatial information such as axis cell and boundary vector signals ( Lever et al . , 2009; Derdikman , 2009; Olson et al . , 2017; Simonnet and Brecht , 2019; Bicanski and Burgess , 2020 ) , also precisely targets layer 2/3 principal neurons in RSG ( Nitzan et al . , 2020; Yamawaki et al . , 2019a ) . These inputs overlap with LR cell bodies and basal dendrites and have been shown to evoke larger excitatory postsynaptic currents in superficial compared to layer 5 pyramidal neurons ( Nitzan et al . , 2020; Yamawaki et al . , 2019a ) . These results suggest that DS projections to RSC may be targeting LR cells , potentially resulting in converging spatial information from both ADAV and DS onto LR cells . However , it remains unknown whether LR or layer 3 RS cells are the predominant target of these DS projections . To investigate this , we repeated our CRACM protocols and examined the functional responses of LR and layer 3 RS cells to DS inputs ( Figure 5A&B ) . We found that DS afferents to layer 3 of RSG precisely overlap with LR basal and , to a lesser degree , proximal apical dendrites ( Figure 5C ) but not RS basal dendrites ( Figure 5D ) . Correspondingly , LR neurons responded with significantly larger EPSPs compared to RS neurons when DS inputs were stimulated at the cell body in layer 3 ( p=0 . 004; Figure 5E ) . Our high-resolution protocol and population analysis also confirmed that LR cells had significantly larger responses at layers 1/2 and 3 compared to L1a ( L1/2 p=0 . 0132 , L3 p=0 . 0135; Figure 5F&G ) , suggesting the possibility of integration of synchronous anterior thalamic and dorsal subicular inputs by LR neurons . In contrast , RS cells showed no significant laminal differences in response to DS input ( p>0 . 05 for all; Figure 5G ) . Thus , inputs from both the dorsal subiculum and anterior thalamus target LR cells , reflecting their precise overlap with LR dendrites , while the claustrum and anterior cingulate cortex instead target RS cells . We next extended our physiological examination of superficial RSG circuits to include correlational analyses and dual injection experiments ( Figure 6A ) . We found that LR dendrites are strongly and significantly positively correlated with both ADAV ( r\u00a0=\u00a00 . 88 , p<0 . 001 ) and DS ( r\u00a0=\u00a00 . 69 , p=1 . 41e-254 ) axons . In contrast , RS dendrites are strongly correlated with CLA ( r\u00a0=\u00a00 . 29 , p=4 . 82e-36 ) and ACC ( r\u00a0=\u00a00 . 43 , p=5 . 73e-82 ) axons . Notably , LR dendrites are significantly negatively correlated with both CLA ( r\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120 . 49 , p=1 . 16e-110 ) and ACC ( r\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120 . 15 , p=1 . 00e-10 ) axons , and RS dendrites are negatively correlated with ADAV ( r\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120 . 55 , p=2 . 47e-145 ) and DS ( r\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120 . 44 , p=7 . 74e-85 ) axons ( Figure 6B&C ) . These anatomical results mirror our functional findings that LR neurons are preferentially driven by both ADAV and DS inputs , while RS neurons are targeted by CLA and ACC inputs . We also compared laminar expression of afferents from the four input regions and found that ADAV and DS inputs to RSG , which both at least in part target layer 3 , were significantly positively correlated with one another ( r\u00a0=\u00a00 . 55 , p=2 . 93e-143 ) . Similarly , CLA and ACC inputs , which both target the lower divisions of L1 as well as L5 , were also significantly positively correlated ( r\u00a0=\u00a00 . 23 , p=2 . 3e-23 ) . However , ADAV and DS inputs were significantly negatively correlated with both CLA and ACC inputs , confirming that these two streams target separate sublayers within RSG ( Figure 6B , C ) . Dendrite-dendrite correlations of LR and RS cell populations were also strongly anti-correlated ( r\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120 . 65 , p=3 . 00e-215; Figure 6C ) , highlighting the distinct anatomical organization of these two neighboring principal cell types . Taken together , these axon-axon , dendrite-dendrite , and axon-dendrite correlations indicate that precise , fine-grained laminar organization of LR and RS dendrites and afferent axons creates a parallel circuit in which LR neurons are selectively optimized to integrate incoming spatial information ( Figure 6D ) . Supplemental examination of contralateral RSG ( cRSG ) inputs to RSG showed lamination and resulting cell-type-specific targeting resembling that of projections from CLA and ACC ( Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . Specifically , cRSG inputs targeted L1c , L2 , and L5 , resulting in strong activation of RS cells , with almost no responses in LR cells ( Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . This again suggests that inputs from CLA , ACC and cRSG follow a structured pattern by which these inputs preferentially control RS cells , while ADAV and DS projections target LR cells . Importantly , laminar dichotomies similar to those seen here in RSG also exist between TC and ClaC/corticocortical projections to other cortical regions such as the medial prefrontal cortex ( Cruikshank et al . , 2012 ) , as also revealed by our examination of anatomical datasets from the Allen Brain Institute ( Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . Thus , our findings may also highlight a more universal framework by which other cortical regions integrate and process thalamic versus claustral and cortical inputs . To investigate the functional implications of these parallel circuits , we next examined the short-term dynamics of each input onto the RSG principal cells . LR short-term dynamics were examined in response to ADAV and DS inputs , while RS short-term dynamics were examined in response to CLA and ACC inputs ( see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods ) . In contrast to previously documented thalamocortical matrix inputs to both superficial pyramidal cells and interneurons ( Anastasiades et al . , 2021; Cruikshank et al . , 2012 ) , 10 Hz anterior thalamic inputs from ADAV to RSG LR neurons were uniquely and significantly depressing ( p=1 . 02e-5 , Wilcoxon rank sum test; Figure 7A&B ) . In contrast , 10 Hz DS inputs to LR neurons were not depressing and exhibited weak facilitation ( Figure 7A&B ) . Both CLA and ACC inputs to RS cells were also weakly facilitating ( Figure 7C&D ) . Thus , the synaptic depression of anterior thalamic inputs to LR neurons is unique among the inputs examined here and also distinct from anterior thalamic inputs to superficial principal neurons in PFC and ACC ( Cruikshank et al . , 2012 ) . As expected , we found that ADAV inputs to LR cells do not show synaptic depression at the much slower stimulation frequency of 0 . 1 Hz ( Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1 panel C ) , but 40 Hz inputs resulted in stronger depression than 10 Hz ( p=0 . 0022 , Wilcoxon rank sum test; Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1 panel B ) . We next used computational modeling to elucidate the functional role of synaptic depression in this circuit , especially with respect to the processing of head direction input ( Taube , 1995; Taube and Bassett , 2003 ) . Up to 60% of cells in the anterior thalamus are classical head direction ( HD ) cells ( Taube and Bassett , 2003 ) . Each HD cell has a unique preferred direction at which its firing rate is highest when the head is facing that direction . The preferred directions of all cells in the HD ensemble span the full range of compass directions ( Taube , 1998 ) . Our modeling setup consisted of a postsynaptic RSG LR cell receiving input from an ensemble of 7500 presynaptic HD cells via depressing synapses ( for full details , see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods ) . In the initial simulations shown in Figure 8 , the morphologically realistic model LR cell ( Brennan et al . , 2020 ) received uniform inputs ( all HDs being equally likely ) via depressing synapses with Tsodyks-Markram short-term dynamics ( Tsodyks et al . , 1998 ) . The synaptic parameters were fit to match the experimentally observed response of LR cells to optogenetic stimulation of thalamic afferents reported above ( Figure 7 ) . We found that the firing rate of the postsynaptic LR cell receiving HD input via depressing synapses was strongly correlated with angular head speed , giving rise to symmetrical angular head velocity tuning ( Figure 8B&C ) . Identical HD inputs transmitted via non-depressing synapses resulted in LR firing rates that were uncorrelated with angular head speed ( Figure 8B , E\u2013F ) . It is important to note that in our model , firing rates of input HD cells were not explicitly modulated by angular head velocity; therefore , the observed speed tuning resulted strictly from the depressing synaptic dynamics . For the parameter set whose results are depicted , LR cell firing rate was optimally correlated with head speed 24 ms in the past , confirmed by both cross-correlation and mutual information analyses ( Figure 8E&F ) . We obtained the same results when modeling an ensemble of only 2500 presynaptic HD cells , indicating that our results are robust to the size of the presynaptic population ( Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . Taken together , these results suggest that synaptic depression of HD ensemble inputs introduces an angular head speed signal into the LR population , producing neurons that are more responsive during faster head turns , and potentially supporting the spatial orientation encoding functions attributed to the RSG ( Epstein , 2008; Ino et al . , 2007; Milczarek et al . , 2018; Miller et al . , 2019 ) . Anterior thalamic HD cells display anticipatory firing ( Blair et al . , 1997 ) , a phenomenon where an HD cell becomes most active at a fixed time interval before the animal is facing that cell\u2019s preferred direction ( Figure 9A ) . This temporal offset associated with each cell is called its anticipatory time interval ( ATI ) . In anterior thalamus , the mean ATI has been reported as 25\u201350 ms ( Taube , 2010 ) . In our initial simulations , shown in Figure 8 , we drew the ATI of each HD cell randomly from distributions matching these known in vivo ranges . To more systematically understand if and how the ATI of HD cells influences angular head speed coding by LR neurons , we next performed a series of simulations using various fixed ATI values for the entire HD population ( Figure 9A ) and analyzed the resulting postsynaptic LR response . Increasing ATI from 0 ms ( no anticipation by the HD cell ) to higher values ( HD cell firing prior to facing the preferred HD ) improved the lag between LR firing rate and angular head speed , with larger ATIs resulting in shorter latency between the head movement and LR coding of that angular head speed ( Figure 9C ) . Remarkably , larger ATIs also improved the angular head speed tuning of LR neurons independent of lag , as quantified by the maximum value ( over the full range of lags ) of cross-correlation or cross-mutual information ( Figure 9B ) . Thus , anticipatory firing of HD cells may constitute a powerful coding principle in the thalamo-retrosplenial circuit , helping LR cells to not only encode the current head speed with minimal lag , but also better encode the head speed independent of the lag . In order to better understand this surprising effect , as well as how speed tuning generally arises , we analytically studied a simplified mean-field model of this thalamo-retrosplenial circuit ( Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . Our analysis allowed us to mathematically derive that LR activity should encode head speed with depressing synapses from simplified HD cells ( see Appendix ) . Moreover , the analysis showed that anticipatory firing compensates for the lag introduced by integration time , leading to a theoretical parameter regime for which postsynaptic speed coding can be essentially perfect ( where LR firing rate reflects head speed exactly with minimal latency ) . The observed improvement in quality of speed coding with increases in ATI corresponds to moving closer to this regime . Finally , our analysis showed that postsynaptic activity , at least at lower rotational speeds , is proportional to the square of head speed , thereby explaining the concave-up , parabolic shape of the speed-firing rate curve ( Figure 8C and Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . Thus , both the simulations and the analytical theory show that synaptic depression of HD cell input onto LR cells should result in angular speed coding in the LR cell firing rate , and that anticipatory firing improves both the precision and quality of this coding . In the simulations above , we utilized a uniform distribution of HD inputs to each LR cell , such that each preferred direction was equally represented . However , in practice , it is likely that there will be heterogeneity in the preferred HDs of the cells providing inputs to any given retrosplenial LR cell . To study the extent to which speed coding persists under these conditions , we simulated a population of 200 LR cells , each of which received inputs from a randomly selected distribution of preferred directions for the presynaptic HD cells ( Figure 10Ai , , Bi , Ci ) . We then analyzed the information content of each LR cell\u2019s firing rate , assessing the correlation and mutual information with both head direction and speed . We found that single cell activity in the LR population could encode both head direction and head speed ( Figure 10Aii , Bii , Cii ) , but there was a clear tradeoff between the two types of information . This tradeoff between directional versus speed encoding was explained by the level of heterogeneity in the presynaptic preferred direction distribution ( Figure 10D\u2013F ) , making intuitive sense . If an LR cell receives inputs that represent each HD equally , then it is not biased towards any one HD and encodes direction poorly . However , it encodes head speed very strongly in this case because it is able to sample the speed across all directions\u2014there are no directional blind spots where the LR cell cannot detect the speed of head rotation from its presynaptic inputs . On the other hand , consider an LR cell that , by chance , gets inputs from a higher proportion of HD cells encoding a direction around 180 degrees . Now , the output of this LR cell is better correlated with direction , acting as a broadly tuned HD cell itself and preferring 180 degrees , but also firing at most other directions . However , this LR cell\u2019s encoding of head speed gets worse because it under-samples many of the head directions faced by an animal . Thus , non-uniform HD inputs via depressing thalamocortical synapses represent a simple mechanism by which LR cells can conjunctively encode both head direction and head speed . Overall , our results predict in vivo LR neuronal spike trains that are likely to correlate with both the head direction and rotational speed of an animal , with a tradeoff between direction versus speed coding seen across individual LR cells ( Figure 10E ) . \n The small , excitable LR cells are unique among pyramidal cells in RSG , and there is no evidence , to our knowledge , for such cells in any other cortical regions ( Brennan et al . , 2020; Holmgren et al . , 2003; Jiang et al . , 2015; Kurotani et al . , 2013; Wyss et al . , 1990 ) . Indeed , the \u2018granular\u2019 in granular retrosplenial cortex refers to the appearance of these dense small cell bodies in superficial RSG ( Sripanidkulchai and Wyss , 1987; Vogt and Peters , 1981 ) . Thus , LR cells are the defining morphological feature of RSG . The distinct electrophysiological properties of LR neurons , specifically , play an integral role in the RSG\u2019s unique capacity to process anterior thalamic head direction inputs . We have previously reported that the low rheobase and lack of spike frequency adaptation of these neurons are their defining computational features ( Brennan et al . , 2020 ) . For this reason , we refer to them as low-rheobase ( LR ) neurons . They have also been called late-spiking ( LS ) neurons ( Kurotani et al . , 2013; Yousuf et al . , 2020 ) , but we argue this name is not optimal for several reasons . First , many other neurons in superficial RSG are also late spiking ( Brennan et al . , 2020 ) , with L2/3 fast-spiking ( FS ) interneurons and also some RS neurons exhibiting a substantial delay to first spike , likely due to increased Kv1 . 1 or 1 . 2 channel expression in this region compared to other cortical areas ( Kurotani et al . , 2013 ) . Thus , late-spiking is neither a distinctive feature of LR neurons nor excitatory neurons in this region . Second , the name \u2018late-spiking ( LS ) neuron\u2019 is already the accepted and widely used nomenclature referring to a distinct inhibitory neuronal subtype , the neurogliaform cells that are located throughout the cortical layers in many regions of the brain , including within layer 1 of RSG ( Cruikshank et al . , 2012; Hestrin and Armstrong , 1996; Kawaguchi and Kubota , 1997; Overstreet-Wadiche and McBain , 2015 ) . Instead , the defining computational feature of the small pyramidal cells in L2/3 of the RSG is their low rheobase , and this nomenclature serves to provide an unambiguous name for these hyperexcitable cells ( Brennan et al . , 2020 ) . Previous work has reported TC-evoked responses in layer 5 RS neurons at their apical dendrites ( Yamawaki et al . , 2019b ) , with some variation in the magnitude of responses across cells . Our results reproduce these observations ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . Layer 5 is not a homogenous layer , often divided into sublayers 5A and 5B ( Sempere-Ferr\u00e0ndez et al . , 2019; Sempere-Ferr\u00e0ndez et al . , 2018; Sigwald et al . , 2020; Sripanidkulchai and Wyss , 1987; Yamawaki et al . , 2016a ) and contains a variety of pyramidal cells , including the thin-tufted and thick-tufted neurons who have been shown to exhibit different responses to external inputs ( Sempere-Ferr\u00e0ndez et al . , 2018; Wyss et al . , 1990 ) . Further work is needed to determine whether any particular subtype of layer five pyramidal neurons may exhibit substantial TC-evoked responses , but our results , reporting significantly larger responses to TC input by LR neurons , suggest LR cells are the predominant spatial information-encoding subtype within RSG . The dorsal subiculum , which serves to transmit allocentric spatial information such as axis and boundary vector signals ( Lever et al . , 2009; Derdikman , 2009; Olson et al . , 2017; Simonnet and Brecht , 2019; Bicanski and Burgess , 2020 ) , also precisely targets LR neurons via projections predominantly to layer 3 of RSG ( Figure 5; Nitzan et al . , 2020; Yamawaki et al . , 2019a ) . These inputs overlap with LR cell bodies , basal dendrites , and apical dendrites in L1b/c and evoke larger excitatory postsynaptic currents in superficial cells compared to layer 5 pyramidal neurons ( Figure 5; Nitzan et al . , 2020; Yamawaki et al . , 2019a ) . Thus , the distinct morphology and intrinsic properties of LR neurons make them ideally suited to integrate head direction input from the thalamus and spatial inputs from the hippocampal formation via the dorsal subiculum . Indeed , this integration of various types of directional and distance information is often stated as the key computational function of the retrosplenial cortex as a whole ( van Wijngaarden et al . , 2020; Burgess et al . , 2001; Byrne et al . , 2007; Epstein , 2008; Ichinohe et al . , 2003; Maguire , 2001 ) , further highlighting the defining role that LR cells are likely to serve in the RSG . We have shown that thalamocortical synapses onto LR cells are depressing ( Figure 7 ) . Our modeling results demonstrate that such depressing synapses allow LR neurons to compute angular head speed from head direction input , leading to robust encoding of angular speed in the postsynaptic LR firing rate ( Figure 8 ) . This result is in line with previous studies ( Abbott et al . , 1997; de la Rocha and Parga , 2008; Puccini et al . , 2007 ) that use synaptic depression to implement neural circuits that perform rate of change computations . We also find that LR encoding of angular head speed is improved by the fact that input HD cells display anticipatory firing ( Figure 9; Blair et al . , 1997 ) . This improvement not only allows LR cells to encode current head speed with a shorter time lag ( Figure 9C ) , but also strengthens the correlation with head speed regardless of lag ( Figure 9B ) . This proposed mechanism by which depressing synapses compute head speed is fully generalizable , and thus may also be of relevance to other brain circuits employing HD-like population codes ( Maunsell and Van Essen , 1983 ) . Furthermore , we have shown that this thalamocortical synapse can support conjunctive encoding of both head direction and angular head speed by individual LR cells ( Figure 10 ) . Our results make specific predictions about the coding properties of LR cells that can be tested with in vivo recordings . First , based on their intrinsic properties ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1; Brennan et al . , 2020 ) , LR cells in superficial RSG are likely to show high firing rates and spike widths intermediate to the standard \u2018broad/narrow\u2019 criteria currently used to distinguish putative RS and FS cells in most cortical recordings . Thus , future recordings will need a large sampling of cells in L2/3 of RSG to provide enough data to identify the predicted three distinct clusters of spike shapes ( RS/LR/FS ) . Second , we expect LR cell activity to be correlated with angular head speed with a relatively small lag ( Figures 8 and 9 ) . Third , we predict that the experimentally observed head velocity tuning curves will be concave up and exhibit approximately quadratic scaling at low rotational speeds , as our analytical work suggests ( Figure 8; Appendix ) . Fourth , we anticipate a significant proportion of LR cells will show conjunctive encoding , where both angular head speed and direction are encoded . A key aspect of this conjunctive encoding , as predicted by our simulations ( Figure 10 ) , is that individual cells will show a tradeoff between directional and speed encoding . As a population , this is likely to allow LR cells to comprehensively encode conjunctive speed and directional information and provide this information to downstream targets , helping with spatial orientation computations within RSG . This predicted conjunctive encoding will also necessitate that the test of predictions 2 and 3 be carried out in a head-direction delimited manner . Our modeling work so far has focused on understanding the computational implications of thalamic inputs to LR cells . Future work , beyond the scope of the present study , will be needed to understand how these thalamic inputs interact precisely with dorsal subiculum inputs . Given the diversity of spatial and directional encoding seen in the dorsal subiculum ( Lever et al . , 2009; Derdikman , 2009; Olson et al . , 2017; Simonnet and Brecht , 2019; Bicanski and Burgess , 2020 ) , computational models will allow for the rigorous undertanding of how each possible type of subicular input ( e . g . axis versus boundary vector cells ) to LR cells interacts with thalamic head direction inputs . Very recent work on understanding the tuning properties of subicular cells in a projection-specific manner will help to narrow the functional range of possible dorsal subicular inputs to LR cells ( Kitanishi et al . , 2021 ) . We anticipate that one key impact of dorsal subicular inputs to LR cells will be to impose a spatial filter on the angular speed and directional predictions stated above . In particular , the precise organization of layer 1 dendrites and axons may make LR cells most responsive to the near-synchronous arrival of inputs from both thalamic head direction cells ( at distal apical dendrites in L1a ) and dorsal subicular boundary vector or axis cells ( at more proximal apical dendrite locations in lower L1 ) . Similar cooperative dendritic activation patterns are also a hallmark of integration of entorhinal and CA3 inputs by CA1 pyramidal cells , where they help to overcome the effects of strong dendritic inhibition and shape the firing of place cells ( Ahmed and Mehta , 2009; Golding and Spruston , 1998; Kamondi et al . , 1998; Takahashi et al . , 2012 ) . LR neurons do not synapse onto neighboring excitatory neurons within layers 2/3 ( Brennan et al . , 2020 ) , and no ( 0/9 ) pairs tested in this study between LR and layer 5 RS cells exhibited connectivity ( data not shown ) . Thus , LR cells likely do not provide any substantial input to other LR cells or any RS cells located in layers 2\u20135 of ipsilateral RSG . Instead , LR neurons send their axons into the corpus callosum and may likely target homotopic regions of contralateral RSG ( Brennan et al . , 2020; Kurotani et al . , 2013 ) . Indeed , retrograde injections into one RSG hemisphere have been shown to predominantly label small contralateral L2/3 cells ( Sripanidkulchai and Wyss , 1987; Van Groen and Wyss , 2003 ) , most likely corresponding to the LR cells that constitute the majority of cells in L2/3 ( Brennan et al . , 2020 ) . Our supplementary results ( Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1 ) show that inputs from contralateral RSG preferentially and strongly target RS neurons , with almost no recruitment of LR neurons . This is consistent with the observed distribution of afferent axons from contralateral RSG: these axons and terminals avoid L1a and L3 where all LR dendrites are located ( Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . Thus , we propose the following hypotheses for LR downstream targets and possible function: LR neurons in one hemisphere receive unilateral inputs from directional cells in the anterior thalamus ( Figures 1 , 2 and 6 ) . These inputs are utilized to encode information about both the speed and direction of head rotations and are subsequently transmitted to RS cells in contralateral , but not ipsilateral , RSG ( Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . Thus , LR cells may serve to perform a hemispheric switch of rotational speed and direction information . Given the known bidirectional connectivity between secondary motor cortex and RSG ( Yamawaki et al . , 2016a ) , RS cells may be able to utilize inputs from contralateral LR cells to perform comparisons of the actual head speed and direction signal with motor efference signals , helping to sharpen the code for spatial orientation in the RSG . However , extensive future investigations of this contralateral circuit are needed to explore these hypotheses . In contrast to thalamic and DS inputs to RSG , projections from both the claustrum and anterior cingulate cortex avoid laminar overlap with LR apical dendrites , instead projecting to the lower divisions of L1/2 and L5 to target RS apical and basal dendrites ( Figures 3 and 4 , and 6 ) . Both the CLA and ACC are heavily implicated in a range of non-spatial behaviors often described as being \u2018cognitive\u2019 or \u2018mnemonic\u2019 in function ( Botvinick , 2007; Brown and Braver , 2005; Carter et al . , 1998; Devinsky et al . , 1995; Kim et al . , 2016; Mohanty et al . , 2007; Smith et al . , 2012; Smythies et al . , 2012; Stevens et al . , 2011 ) , but there is also evidence that these regions exhibit some degree of spatial information processing ( Guterstam et al . , 2015; Jankowski and O'Mara , 2015; Sutherland et al . , 1988; Whishaw et al . , 2001 ) . Indeed , 7\u201315% of cells in the claustrum were found to encode place or boundary-related information ( Jankowski and O'Mara , 2015 ) , though this percentage is relatively low compared to the 60% of anterior thalamic ( Taube , 1998 ) and 61% of dorsal subicular ( Kitanishi et al . , 2021 ) neurons that are known to clearly encode elemental direction , place , and other spatial features . Regardless , retrosplenial RS neurons may be receiving direct spatial inputs from the CLA and ACC in addition to the cognitive and mnemonic information relayed by these two regions . We also speculate that retrosplenial RS neurons may receive directional and spatial information that has already been heavily integrated by LR neurons in the contralateral hemisphere ( Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1 ) , as discussed above . This convergence of disparate signals onto RS cells could then serve to support functions that require both spatial and non-spatial integration , such as contextual fear conditioning , a key function attributed to the RSC ( de Sousa et al . , 2019; Keene and Bucci , 2008a; Keene and Bucci , 2008b; Kwapis et al . , 2015; Yamawaki et al . , 2019a ) . Indeed , a recent study reported that selective ablation of putative retrosplenial RS cells located near the boundary and within upper layer 5 resulted in contextual fear amnesia ( Sigwald et al . , 2020 ) , indicating that these cells are involved in the fear-related functions of the retrosplenial cortex ( Lukoyanov and Lukoyanova , 2006; Yamawaki et al . , 2019a; Yamawaki et al . , 2019b ) . The laminar location of these cells corresponds well to the position of the RS cells recorded in our study that we show to preferentially receive CLA and ACC inputs . Both the CLA ( Cho et al . , 2017; Ipser et al . , 2013; Vakolyuk et al . , 1980; Vetere et al . , 2017; Zingg et al . , 2018 ) and ACC Frankland et al . , 2004; Han et al . , 2003; Steenland et al . , 2012 have been heavily implicated in fear-associated behaviors , suggesting again that CLA and ACC inputs to L3 RS cells help to support the role of these neurons in contextual fear conditioning . Future work that selectively inactivates CLA versus ACC axon terminals in RSC will be necessary to causally confirm the role of each of these synapses in fear conditioning . Another important consideration within the circuits examined here is the role of feedforward inhibition . Matrix TC inputs evoke feedforward inhibition to regulate cortical signaling through both disinhibition ( Anastasiades et al . , 2021; Delevich et al . , 2015 ) and the disynaptic inhibition of pyramidal neurons ( Cruikshank et al . , 2012; Yamawaki et al . , 2019a; Yamawaki et al . , 2019b ) . Similarly , ClaC inputs invoke feedforward inhibition in several cortical regions , particularly through recruitment of neuropeptide Y ( NPY ) and , to a lesser degree , FS cells ( Jackson et al . , 2018 ) . Long-range inhibitory signals from CA1 of the hippocampus also target apical dendrites in retrosplenial layer 1a , converging with excitatory anterior thalamic inputs , to precisely regulate these TC inputs and establish a hippocampo-thalamo-retrosplenial network ( Yamawaki et al . , 2019b ) . This fine-grained laminar overlap strongly suggests that these inhibitory signals may regulate responses to matrix TC input more strongly for LR than layer 5 RS cells and should be investigated further , particularly in the context of integration of spatial information processing . Future work will examine the effect of feedforward inhibition on the subpopulations of retrosplenial principal neurons in response to these converging inputs in order to establish a thorough understanding of the circuitry facilitating retrosplenial information processing , particularly with regard to head direction signals . In summary , our results highlight a superficial retrosplenial circuit enabled by the precise sublaminar organization of distinct principal neuronal subtypes and axonal afferents . LR neurons receive directional and spatial inputs from the anterior thalamus and dorsal subiculum . The synaptic dynamics of thalamic inputs to LR cells can give rise to rate coding of angular head speed in LR cells . In contrast , neighboring RS neurons in RSG respond very weakly to these directional inputs , as their apical and basal dendrites distinctly avoid laminar overlap with anterior thalamic and subicular afferents . Instead , RS neurons respond to claustrocortical and anterior cingulate inputs . Determining how these two parallel streams of information are integrated in downstream neurons within both the ipsilateral and contralateral granular and dysgranular retrosplenial cortices is the next critical step toward a mechanistic understanding of retrosplenial computations . \n All procedures and use of animals were approved by the University of Michigan Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee . The following mouse lines were used for the CRACM experiments: Ai14 ( Jackson Laboratories , 007914 ) , Ai32 ( Jackson Laboratories , 024109 ) , C57BL6 wildtypes ( Charles River , stock #027 ) , Camk2\u03b1Cre ( Jackson Laboratories , 005359 ) , Grp-KH288Cre ( RRID:MMRRC 037585-UCD ) , PvalbCre ( PV-IRES-Cre; Jackson Laboratories , 008069 ) , and PvalbCre x Ai14 ( crossed in house ) . A combined total of 70 mice of both sexes between the ages of P41\u2013P184 were used in this study . Our model circuit consists of an RSG LR cell receiving input from an ensemble of N\u00a0thalamic HD cells , via synapses exhibiting short-term depression . Thalamic HD cells exhibit an anticipatory time interval , or ATI: for each cell , there exists some constant duration Ams such that the cell tends to spike Ams prior to when the animal\u2019s heading equals the preferred direction of the cell . We define this notion more precisely following a previous study ( Blair et al . , 1997 ) . Restrict attention to a specific HD cell , with ATI Ams , and let \u03b8\u00a0denote its PA when the angular head velocity is zero . The ATI is defined via the property that when angular head velocity equals\u00a0\u03c9 , the PA of this cell shifts from \u03b8\u00a0to\u00a0\u03b8-\u03c9A . Equivalently , we can think of HD cell PAs as static and instead say anticipatory firing effectively transforms the heading trajectory itself: if \u03b8Tt describes the true angular trajectory , the effective trajectory experienced by our chosen HD cell is:\u03b8A ( t ) =\u03b8T ( t ) +A\u22c5\u03b8T\u02d9 ( t ) To simulate the angular trajectory\u00a0\u03b8Tt , we employ in vivo mouse head tracking recordings from the data set CRCNS-th1 ( Peyrache et al . , 2015 ) . These in vivo heading recordings were originally sampled at a relatively low rate of approximately 40 Hz; in order to facilitate use of this data at the finer time scale of HD cell spiking , we linearly interpolated the raw data . Angular head velocity was computed using the standard centered approximation to the derivative:\u03b8\u02d9T ( ti ) \u2248\u03b8T ( ti+1 ) \u2212\u03b8T ( ti\u22121 ) ti+1\u2212ti\u22121 In the Tsodyks-Markram ( TM ) model ( Tsodyks et al . , 1998 ) of short-term synaptic plasticity , each synapse has a finite pool from which it releases vesicles into the cleft upon arrival of a presynaptic spike . The state of the synapse at any moment in time is characterized by the triple\u00a0x , u , g , specified as: Here , t\u00a0is measured in milliseconds , g\u00a0in umho , and the variables x\u00a0and u\u00a0are dimensionless . Depression results from depletion of x\u00a0due to a spike train , followed by slow recovery of the vesicle pool; facilitation results from increase in u\u00a0due to a spike train , followed by slow decay of this release probability . Formally , these dynamical variables satisfy the system:dxdt=1-x\u03c4d-u+x-\u03b4t-tspdudt=-u\u03c4f+U1-u-\u03b4t-tspdgdt=-g\u03c4g+Au+x-\u03b4t-tsp Here , tsp denotes an arbitrary presynaptic spike time , and the \u03b4\u00a0term specifies a discontinuous modification to the variable upon arrival of a presynaptic spike . We use the notation\u00a0f\u00b1t=limh\u21920\u00b1ft+h , and thus u+ and u- satisfy the relation\u00a0u+=u-+U1-u- . The parameters\u00a0\u03c4d , \u03c4f , and \u03c4g set the timescale of depression recovery , facilitation decay , and synaptic conductance decay , respectively . Note that u+\u2265U\u00a0always , so U\u00a0represents the minimum fraction of x\u00a0contributing to the conductance on each presynaptic spike arrival . Finally , the parameter A\u00a0is just a tunable synaptic weight ( with units of umho ) . In the regime of\u00a0\u03c4d\u226b\u03c4f , depression dominates the synaptic dynamics; conversely , in the regime of\u00a0\u03c4f\u226b\u03c4d , facilitation dominates . Accordingly , the limits \u03c4f\u21920 and \u03c4d\u21920 describe depression-only and facilitation-only dynamics , respectively . On the other hand , when \u03c4f and \u03c4d are on the same order of magnitude , the synapse may exhibit combined depressing-facilitating dynamics . We utilized an implementation of the Tsodyks-Markram model as a NEURON mechanism , freely available for download from Model DB ( https://senselab . med . yale . edu/ModelDB/showmodel . cshtml ? model=3815 ) . For all simulations , we use the parameters:\u03c4d=270\u00a0ms , \u03c4f=40\u00a0ms , U=0 . 28in the TM model . We obtained this parameter set by fitting the TM model response to recorded EPSP amplitudes evoked via thalamocortical stimulation of RSG LR cells with a 10 Hz pulse train ( Figures 2 and 7 ) . This was accomplished by searching parameter space exhaustively for the parameter set minimizing a least-squares loss function . The resultant TM dynamics were moderately depressing , in accordance with the experimental results . Non-depressing synapses were modeled as standard exponential synapses with instantaneous rise time . We model the postsynaptic LR cell using the morphologically detailed model originally presented in Brennan et al . , 2020 . This model , implemented in NEURON ( Carnevale and Hines , 2006 ) , consists of Hodgkin-Huxley conductances representing a fast sodium current , a delayed rectifier potassium current , and a Kv1 . 1-mediated slow potassium current . We place each HD input\u00a0\u2192 LR synapse at a random location on a distal apical dendrite of the LR cell; varying this synaptic placement does not qualitatively change results ( data not shown ) . Each postsynaptic cell receives input from N\u00a0presynaptic HD cells , each of which has a unique PA . When studying postsynaptic speed coding , we initially drew the PA of each HD cell uniformly at random from\u00a00 , 2\u03c0 . Later on , we examined the effect of introducing nonuniform PA distributions . In this case , we assumed that the PA distribution of each LR cell was continuous as a function of angle , and thus modeled the PA distribution probability densities randomly as resulting from Brownian bridge processes ( to ensure 2\u03c0\u00a0periodicity of the density ) . We then used inverse transform sampling to draw from the generated distributions . To quantify the extent to which postsynaptic activity reflects head turning speed , we utilized two similarity measures\u00a0M: Pearson correlation and mutual information . In fact , we used the time-lagged counterparts of these measures: for a pair of time series\u00a0xt , yt , their l-lagged similarity measure is\u00a0Mxt , yt-l . Varying\u00a0l , we obtain the cross-correlation and cross-mutual information between the two variables . Throughout the paper , when referring to an instance of measure M\u00a0between time series\u00a0xt , yt , we either report the function l\u21a6Mxt , yt-l\u00a0or just the maximum value of the function:maxlMxt , yt-l In order to compute mutual information , we discretized the time series for head turning speed and postsynaptic firing rate into 40 bins each and calculated the mutual information between these discrete proxies .", "headings": ["Abstract", "Introduction", "Results", "Discussion", "Materials and methods"], "keywords": ["neuroscience"], "id": "elife-62207-v1"}
{"lay_summary": "Traumatic brain injury can result from direct head concussions , rapid head movements , or a blast wave generated by an explosion . Traumatic brain injury often causes seizures in the short term and is a risk factor for certain dementias , including Alzheimer\u2019s disease and chronic traumatic encephalopathy in the long term . A protein called Tau undergoes a series of chemical changes in these dementias that makes it accumulate , form toxic filaments and kill neurons . The toxic abnormal Tau proteins are initially found only in certain regions of the brain , but they spread as the disease progresses . Previous studies in Alzheimer\u2019s disease and other diseases where Tau proteins are abnormal suggest that Tau can spread between neighboring neurons and this can be promoted by neuron activity . However , scientists do not know whether similar mechanisms are at work following traumatic brain injury . Given that seizures are very common following traumatic brain injury , could they be partly responsible for promoting dementia ? To investigate this , researchers need animal models in which they can measure neural activity associated with traumatic brain injury and observe the spread of abnormal Tau proteins . Alyenbaawi et al . engineered zebrafish so that their Tau proteins would be fluorescent , making it possible to track the accumulation of aggregated Tau protein in the brain . Next , they invented a simple way to perform traumatic brain injury on zebrafish larvae by using a syringe to produce a pressure wave . After this procedure , many of the fish exhibited features consistent with progression towards dementia , and seizure-like behaviors . The results showed that post-traumatic seizures are linked to the spread of aggregates of abnormal Tau following traumatic brain injury . Alyenbaawi et al . also found that anticonvulsant drugs can lower the levels of abnormal Tau proteins in neurons , preventing cell death , and could potentially ameliorate dementias associated with traumatic brain injury . These drugs are already being used to prevent post-traumatic epilepsy , but more research is needed to confirm whether they reduce the risk or severity of Tau-related neurodegeneration .", "article": "Traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) is a prominent risk factor for dementias including tauopathies like chronic traumatic encephalopathy ( CTE ) . The mechanisms that promote prion-like spreading of Tau aggregates after TBI are not fully understood , in part due to lack of tractable animal models . Here , we test the putative role of seizures in promoting the spread of tauopathy . We introduce \u2018tauopathy reporter\u2019 zebrafish expressing a genetically encoded fluorescent Tau biosensor that reliably reports accumulation of human Tau species when seeded via intraventricular brain injections . Subjecting zebrafish larvae to a novel TBI paradigm produced various TBI features including cell death , post\u2013traumatic seizures , and Tau inclusions . Bath application of dynamin inhibitors or anticonvulsant drugs rescued TBI-induced tauopathy and cell death . These data suggest a role for seizure activity in the prion-like seeding and spreading of tauopathy following TBI . Further work is warranted regarding anti-convulsants that dampen post-traumatic seizures as a route to moderating subsequent tauopathy . \n Traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) is a leading cause of mortality and disability worldwide ( Hay et al . , 2016; Nguyen et al . , 2016; Rimel et al . , 1981 ) . It is also\u00a0a prominent risk factor for neurodegeneration and dementia , such as chronic traumatic encephalopathy ( CTE ) ( Chauhan , 2014; Gardner and Yaffe , 2015; Uryu et al . , 2007 ) . TBI can result from direct physical insults , from rapid acceleration and deceleration of the brain , or from shock wave impacts such as pressure waves emanating from explosive blasts ( Cruz-Haces et al . , 2017 ) . Regardless , the primary mechanisms have much in common and the neuropathology in TBI and CTE patients includes the wide distribution of hyperphosphorylated Tau pathology , axonal degeneration , and neuronal loss ( Hay et al . , 2016; Johnson et al . , 2013; McKee et al . , 2015; Ojo et al . , 2016 ) . The mechanisms whereby physical injury is translated into progressive Tau pathology remain unresolved and represent prospective therapeutic targets . Progress on this front is hampered by lack of access to suitable models: applying physical injury to a cell culture is difficult and poorly represents the complex biopathology that intertwines many multifaceted aspects of brain physiology . The progressive deposition of hyperphosphorylated Tau protein in filamentous forms is a defining hallmark of tauopathies , which includes Alzheimer\u2019s disease ( AD ) , CTE , and several other dementias . Each of the tauopathies affects distinct brain regions and has a unique clinical presentation ( Kovacs , 2017; Orr et al . , 2017 ) . Early in CTE , hyperphosphorylated Tau is accumulated in a cluster of perivascular neurons and glia in the depths of cortical sulci . Later in CTE , Tau pathology is widespread and incorporates cortical and subcortical gray-matter areas ( Hay et al . , 2016; Johnson et al . , 2012; McKee et al . , 2015 ) . This broad spreading of Tau pathology in CTE can also be observed following TBI ascribed to single trauma events ( Johnson et al . , 2012 ) . This spreading of Tauopathy is consistent with a prion-like mechanism; indeed , brain homogenates from mice subjected to TBI can initiate p-Tau pathology when injected into healthy wild-type mice ( Zanier et al . , 2018 ) . The recipient mice develop a p-Tau pathology similar to single severe TBI patients , which then spreads from injection sites to distant regions , behaving similarly to bona fide prions ( Zanier et al . , 2018 ) . Beyond TBI , the self-propagation and prion-like spread of Tau aggregates is thought to play a key role in the progression of other tauopathies such as AD ( Iba et al . , 2013; Iba et al . , 2015; Mudher et al . , 2017; Narasimhan et al . , 2017; Sanders et al . , 2014 ) . Mechanisms of Tau spreading , and the therapeutic targets they offer , have principally been defined in vitro and include tunnelling nanotubes and extracellular vesicles ( EVs such as exosomes and synaptic vesicles ) and their uptake via endocytosis ( Colin et al . , 2020; Demaegd et al . , 2018; Evans et al . , 2018 ) . In AD and other tauopathies , observations from patients and mice have highlighted the capacity of Tau seeds to spread trans-synaptically ( Goedert et al . , 1989; Pickett et al . , 2017 ) . Moreover , it has been shown that neuronal activity serves an important role in the spread of Tau pathology and general proteostasis ( Pickett et al . , 2017; Wu et al . , 2016; Yamada et al . , 2014 ) . Stimulation of neuronal activity increased the extracellular release of Tau to the media in vitro and enhanced Tau pathology in a mouse model of familial frontotemporal dementia ( Pickett et al . , 2017; Wu et al . , 2016; Yamada et al . , 2014 ) . Whether similar mechanisms of Tau release and spread occur following TBI remains unknown . In this light , an intriguing aspect of TBI is the prominence of post-traumatic seizures that might be predicted to initiate the aggregation and/or exacerbate the spread of Tau pathology . Seizures are one of the key consequences of all types of TBI , and they have been more commonly reported in patients who suffered from blast injuries ( Asikainen et al . , 1999; Salinsky et al . , 2015 ) . Although the exact prevalence remains undetermined ( Lucke-Wold et al . , 2015 ) , it is anticipated that over 50% of TBI patients with severe injuries develop seizures or post-traumatic epilepsy ( Kovacs et al . , 2014 ) . A link between seizures and Tau pathology is suggested by increased prevalence of seizures in AD patients and animal models of AD ( S\u00e1nchez et al . , 2018; Yan et al . , 2012 ) . Whether reducing post-traumatic seizures can delay or minimize the progression of tauopathy has yet to be fully explored . This knowledge gap is due in part to a lack of accessible in vivo models that can report the progression and spread of tauopathy , or that allow neural activity associated with TBI to be measured and manipulated . To address these issues , we engineered a tauopathy biosensor transgenic zebrafish that develops GFP+ puncta when Tau aggregates within the brain or spinal cord . Additionally , we introduce a simple medium-throughput method to induce TBI in zebrafish larvae . Combining these novel approaches , we found that post-traumatic seizures correlate strongly with spreading tau pathology following TBI . Manipulating this seizure activity mitigated Tau aggregation and revealed a critical role for endocytosis in the prion-like spread of Tau seeds in vivo following TBI . The results from our novel in vivo TBI model implicate seizures and dynamin-dependent endocytosis in the spread of Tau seeds , thereby offering potential therapeutic targets . \n Previous reports describe the assessment and quantification of Tau inclusions in living cells ( typically Human Embryonic Kidney cells ) , via measuring aggregation of fluorescent proteins fused to Tau protein , providing sensitive detection of pathological Tau species and strain variants ( Kaufman et al . , 2016; Sanders et al . , 2014; Woerman et al . , 2016 ) . Tau is predominantly expressed in the neurons of the CNS , and we reasoned that fluorescent biosensor tools would have good potential to reveal additional phenotypes when expressed in these cells and moreover , that prion-like mechanisms of tauopathy spread are best modeled in an intact brain ( e . g . vectored by blood and glymphatic circulation , ventricles , axonal projections , and immune systems ) . Therefore , we engineered a tauopathy biosensor transgenic zebrafish that expresses a fluorescent Tau reporter protein . Our genetically\u00a0encoded fluorescent reporter protein was composed of the sequence of the human Tau core-repeat domain fused to green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) with a linker sequence and is referred to here as Tau4R-GFP ( Figure 1A and\u00a0its Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A ) . Contrasting previous in vitro models , our biosensor did not feature any pro-aggregation mutations in the human Tau repeats; this design was intended to minimize spontaneous aggregation events . The expression of the biosensor protein in zebrafish was under the control of the pan-neuronal promoter neuronal enolase 2 ( eno2 , see Bai et al . , 2007 ) , which drives expression throughout the CNS ( Figure 1B and its Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C ) . We deployed the transgene in a transparent zebrafish line ( the \u2018Casper\u2019 background [White et al . , 2008] ) to facilitate analysis beyond the early larval development stages ( when pigmentation would otherwise begin to obscure microscopy ) . We isolated a stable transgenic ( Tg ) line that expresses the Tau4R-GFP biosensor reporter robustly and clearly in the CNS ( Figure 1B ) , Tg ( eno2:Hsa . MAPT_Q244-E372\u2212EGFP ) ua3171 , and assigned it allele number ua3171 . Simultaneously , we expressed the same biosensor in vitro to validate the construct we deployed in vivo ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A and B ) . Both in HEK293T cells and Tg zebrafish , immunoblotting using anti-GFP antibody detected our Tau-4R-GFP reporter protein at the expected size of\u00a0~45 Kd , similar to a SOD1:GFP biosensor protein of similar predicted size , and an appropriately larger size relative to GFP protein alone ( Figure 1C and its Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B' ) . We assessed the capacity of our Tau4R-GFP biosensor to report the presence of Tau pathology via transducing brain homogenates into cells . Brain homogenates burdened with tauopathy , from transgenic mice expressing mutant human Tau ( Tg TauP301L ) , were compared to normal non-Tg mouse homogenates as a negative control . Congruent with findings obtained in past similar cell assays ( Sanders et al . , 2014 ) , GFP-positive ( GFP+ ) inclusions were detected only when cells were transduced with brain homogenate containing pathogenic human Tau fibrils ( from Tg TauP310L mice ) ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1D ) . The in vitro assay detection rate was approximately 5% of cells having GFP+ inclusions in total , with 2% of cells forming multiple nuclear puncta and\u00a0~3% forming one cytoplasmic inclusion , whereas various negative controls consistently displayed 0% of cells with inclusions ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1E ) . To verify that Tau aggregates in the clarified brain homogenate caused the GFP+ puncta , we purified Tau aggregates from the tissue samples using PTA precipitations ( Woerman et al . , 2016 ) . Tau fibrils purified from these preparations were characterized via EM analysis ( Figure 1D ) . Transducing these preparations ( in contrast to control preparations derived from non-Tg mice ) produced fluorescent puncta in the Tau4R-GFP reporter cells ( Figure 1E ) , confirming the ability of our Tau4R-GFP chimeric protein to report Tau aggregation . To test if the Tau4R-GFP biosensor can report the in vivo progression of tauopathy , we emulated intracerebral injection methods that induce ( prion-like ) Tau pathology in mice ( Clavaguera et al . , 2013; Guo et al . , 2016; Peeraer et al . , 2015 ) . We injected clarified brain homogenate laden with human Tau fibrils , prepared as above from Tg mice , into the hindbrain ventricle of 2 days post-fertilization ( dpf ) Tau biosensor zebrafish ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A ) . The injected larvae and control groups were monitored daily for up to 4 days post-injection ( dpi ) . Biosensor larvae injected with human Tau fibrils ( from Tg mouse brain ) developed GFP+ puncta , reflective of Tau aggregation in the brain ( Figure 1F , F\u201d ) . These Tau inclusions were prominent near the ventricle wall as well as in sensory neurons along the spinal cord , when injected with brain homogenate from human-tau transgenic mouse ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2B ) . These puncta sometimes appeared to have either a lone dot-like shape or were similar to the multiple nuclear puncta detected in vitro , in which three to four small puncta are clustered together , or in other instances were more diffuse and concentrated outside the nucleus ( Figure 1F , F\u201d ) . Repeated assessment of the location of Tau aggregates on the spinal cord of the same individuals over multiple days , using somite numbers as landmarks , suggested a movement of some of these puncta over time ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3 ) . The abundance of GFP+ spinal cord inclusions was progressive and significantly higher in larvae injected with pathogenic Tau brain homogenate compared with various controls ( Figure 1G . p=0 . 0006 and p=0 . 0033 at 3dpi and 4dpi , respectively compared to injection of healthy wild-type control brain , ordinary two-way ANOVA and Tukey\u2019s multiple comparison test ) . Few larvae in the control groups developed spontaneous inclusions but the number of the larvae and the abundance of those inclusions were minimal ( Figure 1G ) . A total of 80% and 35% of the larvae injected with human Tau fibrils developed puncta in the brain and spinal cord , respectively ( Figure 2H and I ) . On the other hand , a lower proportion of TAu biosensor larvae developed \u2018spontaneous\u2019 inclusions post-injection with the control brain homogenate from wild-type mice ( Figure 2H and I ) . Tau aggregates were detected on the spinal cord region as early as 2 dpi . Intriguingly , a small percentage of larvae developed sporadic GFP+ Tau aggregates regardless of treatment . Visualizing the data as distributions of larvae with particular abundances of GFP+ inclusions ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2C ) highlights a trend where most larvae did not develop aggregates unless they were injected with brain homogenate containing fibrillar , pathogenic human Tau species . In those cases , the biosensor larvae developed an abundant number of aggregates . Overall , these data confirm the ability of our biosensor model to detect pathogenic Tau species in vivo . Like other protein misfolding diseases , tauopathies reflect a proteostatic imbalance wherein the clearance of pathological Tau species is insufficient relative to accumulation ( Chiti and Dobson , 2006; Lim and Yue , 2015 ) . We reasoned that if the Tau biosensor larvae are faithfully reflecting Tau proteostasis concepts in vivo , then this could be revealed via inhibition of the proteasome with MG-132 . Larvae treated with MG-132 had GFP+ puncta in their brains ( Figure 2A ) at a rate approximately double to the occurrence of spontaneous GFP+ inclusions ( Figure 2B ) . Following injection of mouse brain homogenate containing human Tau fibrils , applying the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 substantially enhanced the percentage of larvae bearing Tau4R-GFP+ inclusions in the brain ( to\u00a0~70% , Figure 2B ) , relative to equivalent larvae without MG-132 ( ~36% , Figure 2B ) . It was striking that the zebrafish Tau biosensor was robustly able to discriminate brain homogenates that were burdened\u00a0with human Tau aggregates versus those that were not . However , we considered an alternative explanation for the data: the difference may not depend directly on human Tau in the brain homogenate but could instead reflect other bioactive components of the degenerating Tg mouse brain . To verify that the formation of GFP+ puncta in zebrafish can be seeded by a protein-only injection , we delivered synthetic human Tau protein ( 2N4R ) . After confirming the recombinant Tau proteins were appropriately fibrillized via EM ( Figure 2C ) , we delivered them by intraventricular injections as described above . Similar to previous data with brain homogenate , the larvae that were injected with synthetic Tau fibrils developed inclusions proximal to the brain ventricles as well as along the spinal cord at 3\u20136 dpi . The abundance of Tau aggregates along the spinal cord was significantly higher in larvae injected with the synthetic Tau fibrils compared to larvae injected with Tau monomers or to the non-injected group ( p=0 . 0104 ) ( Figure 2D ) . The distribution of larvae based on the number of Tau aggregates they accumulated also supported these findings ( Figure 2E ) . In sum , the Tau4R biosensor deployed in the CNS of larval zebrafish was able to report Tau species , and further revealed the prion-like induction of tauopathy via protein-only seeding in vivo . We next sought to deploy our Tau biosensor in a tauopathy model that enables higher throughput than can be achieved with intraventricular injection methods . We considered TBI ) as an inducer of the tauopathy in CTE; further , we were encouraged that innovations in this realm could fill an unmet need for a high-throughput , genetically tractable in vivo model of these devastating concussive injuries . Although a few methods have been reported to induce TBI in adult zebrafish that are comparable to mammalian TBI methods ( Maheras et al . , 2018; McCutcheon et al . , 2017 ) , no such methods were available for zebrafish larvae ( although McCutcheon et al . , 2016 argue their application of exogenous glutamate may help address aspects of excitotoxicity associated with such insults ) . Here , we introduce and validate a simple and inexpensive method to induce TBI in zebrafish larvae . Investigating TBI in larvae offers substantial benefits regarding experimental throughput , economy , accessibility of drug and genetic interventions , and bioethics . We devised a traumatic injury paradigm by loading zebrafish larvae ( ~12 individuals in their typical E3 liquid growth media ) into a syringe with a closed valve stopper , and applying a hit on the plunger to produce a pressure wave through the fish body akin to pressure or shock waves experienced during human blast injury ( Nakagawa et al . , 2011; Figure 3A ) . To challenge the method\u2019s reproducibility , and to permit manipulation of injury intensity , a series of defined masses were dropped on the syringe plunger . Technical variability , anticipated from larvae being in different orientations and positions within the syringe , was reduced by applying the injury three times to each group of larvae ( except where noted otherwise ) while repositioning the syringe between each injury . To assess if our method faithfully induced TBI similar to injury from pressure waves , we examined multiple markers known to be associated with blast-induced TBI , including cell death , hemorrhage , blood flow abnormalities , and tauopathy ( Bir et al . , 2012; Kovacs et al . , 2014; Nakagawa et al . , 2011 ) . Additionally , we evaluated the occurrence of post-traumatic seizure activity and increases in neuronal activity acutely associated with the trauma . We established the TBI method via empirical testing of various parameters , restricting ourselves to materials and methods that can be adopted inexpensively , with a goal of consistently inducing a robust injury ( see phenotypes below ) vs . a tradeoff with maximizing survival of the larvae . Subsequent to this optimization , we were able to characterize the pressure induced within the syringe during each injury ( Figure 3B\u2013D ) . The maximum pressure induced was near 170 kPa ( Figure 3B ) . The dynamics of the pressure change events during TBI ( Figure 3B ) imply that dropping the heavier weights led to the weight bouncing and producing a secondary increase in pressure ( e . g . at\u00a0~175 or\u00a0~275 ms in Figure 3B ) . The maximal pressure induced varied from\u00a0~130 to\u00a0~175 kPa in an approximately linear fashion depending on the mass of the weight dropped ( Figure 3D ) . The mean pressure change over the first 300 ms of the TBI also increased in a nearly linear fashion , and increased by nearly an order of magnitude when dropping weights of 30 g compared to 300 g ( Figure 3C ) . We evaluated TBI-induced hemorrhage via the use of Tg ( gata1a:DsRed ) larvae that have red fluorescence in their blood cells ( Traver et al . , 2003 ) . Hemorrhage was observed variably in larvae when a heavy weight ( 300 g ) was used to induce the traumatic injury ( Figure 3E ) . Further , approximately half of the TBI larvae showed abnormalities in blood flow including a temporary reduction or complete absence of blood circulation ( Video 1 ) , consistent with abnormalities detected in rodent TBI models ( Bir et al . , 2012 ) . Subsequently , we assessed apoptosis in the TBI larvae , observing that our TBI method induced cell death in larvae as detected by staining for active Caspase-3 ( Figure 3F and its Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . The number of active-Caspase-3-positive cells was negligible in the control groups compared to a mean of 62 apoptotic cells in TBI larvae ( SEM\u00a0\u00b19 . 17 , n\u00a0=\u00a03 ) and 75 ( SEM\u00a0\u00b14 , n\u00a0=\u00a02 ) in positive-control-larvae ( cell death induced with camptothecin , CPT; Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . These data all align well with existing animal models of TBI with respect to mimicking characteristic features of human TBI , and support the effectiveness of our method in inducing TBI in larval zebrafish . Post-traumatic seizures are one of the most frequent conditions associated with traumatic brain injuries and , despite being prevalent , remain poorly understood in TBI patients ( Kovacs et al . , 2014 ) . Post-traumatic seizures were overtly apparent in a subset ( approximately 40% ) of zebrafish larvae after they were subjected to TBI . In some instances , the activity was highly reminiscent of Stage III seizures ( defined previously in larval zebrafish as the most intense seizures; Liu and Baraban , 2019 ) with bouts of intense clonic convulsions and arrhythmic shaking ( Video 2; exemplar frames from the movie are in Figure 3G ) . Other individuals exhibited hypermotility that is exactly consistent with past definitions of less intense Stage I or Stage II seizures . We quantified the latter seizure activity via behavioral tracking software ( which we had previously optimized and validated for quantifying seizures in larval zebrafish [Kanyo et al . , 2020a; Leighton et al . , 2018] ) and determined that larvae subjected to TBI exhibited seizure-like activity that was significantly higher than the control group ( p=0 . 0013 ) ( Figure 3H ) . Seizures are caused by abnormal and excessive neuronal excitability ( Stafstrom and Carmant , 2015 ) . To document bursts of neuronal activity during the brain trauma , if any , we utilized a genetically encoded calcium imaging CaMPARI reporter ( calcium modulated photoactivatable ratiometric integrator ) expressed throughout the CNS . CaMPARI fluoresces green in baseline conditions , and permanently converts to red fluorescent emission if high intracellular calcium levels ( i . e . neural activity ) occur coincident with application of \u2018photoconverting\u2019 intense 405 nm blue light . We subjected our allele of Tg ( elavl3:CaMPARI ) ua3144 larvae ( Kanyo et al . , 2020b ) to TBI , coincident with brief application of photoconverting light ( 405 nm light provided by an LED array directed at the syringe , as described in Figure 4A ) . A sharp increase in neuronal activity during TBI was evident , especially in the hindbrain region as indicated by enhanced red emission ( Figure 4B ) . CaMPARI allows robust quantification of neural activity expressed as a ratio of red:green fluorescent emission , which confirmed that neuronal excitability increases significantly in response to brain trauma ( Figure 4C and D ) . Notably , this combination of newly introduced methods of TBI being integrated with CaMPARI optogenetic methods ( where the stable/irreversible changes from green to red fluorescent reportage allows a ratiometric quantification in a subsequent microscopy session ) offers the rare ability to assess neural activity on un-restrained ( free-swimming ) subjects during TBI . In sum , our data reveal a substantial burst of neural activity occurs during TBI , and that zebrafish larvae exposed to TBI subsequently exhibit a significantly higher propensity for spontaneous seizures . After validating that our method was able to induce TBI upon zebrafish larvae , we next asked whether TBI induces Tau aggregates in our Tau biosensor model . Initially , we evaluated if our TBI method would induce aggregation of fluorescent proteins in models expressing GFP alone or other biosensor proteins such as SOD1-GFP ( that is also designed to report prion-like protein aggregation ) . Following TBI , and regardless of injury intensity , no GFP+ aggregates were detected in these controls ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . Similar results were obtained with other transgenic zebrafish that express GFP in motor neurons ( data not shown ) . Further , our Tau4R-GFP fish additionally express an unmodified GFP variant in the active heart muscle , and this robust GFP showed no sign of aggregation following TBI . Remarkably , in these same individual Tau4R-GFP larvae we detected Tau4R-GFP biosensor GFP+ puncta in both brains and spinal cords following TBI ( Figure 5A\u2013B ) . The abundance of GFP+ puncta increased with time following the injury ( Figure 5C\u2013D ) . To determine if the severity of tauopathy varies coordinately with severity of the traumatic injury , we assessed the impact of different masses . Although some variability is evident , a dose-response relationship is apparent such that the 65 g , 100 g , and 300 g weights induced more Tau aggregates compared to the control and 30 g weight ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 4 ) . The heaviest weight ( 300 g ) induced significantly more Tau aggregates versus the control group or the group with the 30 g weight ( p<0 . 01 and p<0 . 001 , respectively ) . Therefore , we decided to use both the 300 and 65 g weights for subsequent experiments . We evaluated whether dropping the light weight once or multiple times would affect the number of Tau aggregates on the spinal cord as well as dropping the weight once on 3 consecutive days , perhaps reminiscent of repetitive sports injury . We observed an increase in the abundance of Tau aggregates when the weight was dropped multiple times during 1 day , or over 3 consecutive days , but this increase was not statistically significant ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 4 ) . The GFP+ Tau aggregates formed in the brain region following TBI tend to form fused shapes ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 4A ) reminiscent of the spontaneous aggregates described above . The aggregates on the spinal cord , however , had similar shapes to aggregates detected post brain-injections , but with qualitatively less brightness in some instances . Multi-day monitoring of individual larvae ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplements 2 and 3 ) revealed variation in formation of Tau aggregates amongst individual TBI larvae . We monitored the abundance of Tau aggregates within individual fish over time following TBI and found that the average tauopathy significantly increased compared to the control group ( p=0 . 0224 at 3dpti and *p=0 . 0312 at 4dpti ( days post-traumatic injury ) , Figure 5C , D ) . Analysis of distribution of larvae binned into the number of Tau4R-GFP+ puncta at 3 dpti showed that more larvae developed Tau4R-GFP+ puncta compared to the control group ( inset in Figure 5D ) . Considering that many of the larvae subjected to TBI formed Tau4R-GFP+ puncta in the brain that had a fused pattern ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 4A ) , we focused on Tau aggregates that formed on the spinal cord as their abundance could be most efficiently quantified compared to aggregates that formed in the brain . Considering the clinical prominence of post-traumatic seizures following TBI , and the suggested role of cell stress and increased neural activity in promoting protein misfolding diseases ( Kovacs et al . , 2014; S\u00e1nchez et al . , 2018 ) , we speculated that post-traumatic seizures might form a causal link between TBI and subsequent tauopathy . We first asked if a correlation exists between seizure intensity and extent of tauopathy . Following TBI , some larvae exhibited seizure-like movements , while some did not seem to move abnormally relative to untreated fish ( Figure 3H ) . We sorted the larvae subjected to TBI into groups exhibiting the seizure-like behavior and those that displayed no overtly abnormal movement . Larvae exhibiting seizure-like behavior after TBI went on to develop abundant spinal cord aggregates ( fivefold increase , p<0 . 001 ) in comparison to larvae that showed no seizure-like response to TBI ( Figure 5E ) . To assess the hypothesis that seizure activity has a causal role in increasing the abundance of Tau aggregates in our TBI model , we employed convulsant and anti-convulsant drugs to modulate the seizure intensity and in vivo neural activity . We selected drugs that are well-established to behave similarly in zebrafish as in mammals , although it is perhaps notable that the multi-day drug application used here is longer than the acute applications typically considered in zebrafish ( Ellis et al . , 2012 ) . Our hypothesis predicted that decreasing seizure-like activity following TBI would reduce tauopathy . Indeed , applying the anti-convulsant drug Retigabine ( RTG ) , that opens voltage-gated potassium channels ( KCNQ , Kv7 ) , resulted in a significant decrease in the abundance of GFP+ puncta ( p=0 . 0107 ) with many TBI larvae not developing any Tau4R-GFP aggregates ( Figure 5F ) . Similarly , intensifying post-traumatic seizures via application of the convulsant kainate increased the abundance on tauopathy fourfold ( p<0 . 0001 . Figure 5G ) in a dose-dependent manner ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 5 ) . Kainate did not increase Tau4R-GFP+ puncta in the absence of TBI . Surprisingly , the convulsant 4-aminopyridine did not increase tauopathy ( explored below ) . To assess if the impacts of kainate and retigabine on tauopathy were directly due to their modulation of post-traumatic seizures , we applied effective doses of each in concert . Co-application of kainate and retigabine following TBI produced an abundance of Tau4R-GFP+ puncta that was indistinguishable from larvae receiving TBI without pharmacology ( Figure 5G ) . TBI-induced cell death was likewise correlated with the intensity of post-traumatic seizures . Co-application of kainate and retigabine following TBI increased or decreased , respectively , the abundance of cell death in a manner coordinate with the tauopathy ( Figure 5H ) . Overall , convulsant and anti-convulsant drugs acted to increase and decrease TBI-induced tauopathy , respectively . The drugs appear to be specific \u2013 their individual impacts on tauopathy and cell death are largely attributable to their epileptic and anti-epileptic modulation of post-traumatic seizures , because when kainate and retigabine were applied concurrently they negated each others\u2019 effects . To further examine increased seizure activity after TBI , we applied 4-aminopyridine ( 4-AP ) , a Kv channel blocker and convulsant drug . We predicted that raising the level of seizure activity would elevate tauopathy abundance in our TBI model , aligning with our observations following application of kainate ( above ) . Surprisingly , higher doses of 4-AP consistently abrogated the appearance of Tau aggregates . Treating TBI larvae with 200 or 800 \u03bcM of 4-AP for a prolonged period ( 38 hr , beginning 24 hr post-traumatic injury ) significantly inhibited the abundance of Tau4R-GFP+ puncta in the TBI group ( Figure 6A\u2013B and its Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A-B ) . Analysis of the distribution of larvae linked to the number of Tau aggregates supported this finding with no zebrafish larvae developing aggregates in groups treated with 4-AP ( Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1C ) . It is worth noting that 4-AP is commonly used in zebrafish models of epilepsy , but rarely used for prolonged treatment . To evaluate if the time at which treatments are administered plays a role in this unexpected result , we treated larvae with 200 \u03bcM 4-AP at earlier time points , specifically during TBI and 1 . 5 hr later . We kept the duration of 4-AP treatment the same as previous experiments ( 38 hr ) . We found that administering 4-AP during different time windows relative to the TBI did not measurably alter the inhibitory action of 4-AP on the abundance of Tau aggregates ( Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1D ) . A similar observation was made when the duration of the 4-AP treatment was reduced to 24 hr ( Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1E ) . Next , we considered if this unexpected inhibition of tauopathy by high-dose 4-AP convulsant is a direct consequence of increased neural activity ( e . g . perhaps via neural exhaustion ) . We found that larvae receiving TBI and 4-AP continued to exhibit a lack of Tau aggregates when co-treated with anti-convulsant retigabine ( p<0 . 0001 ) ( Figure 6B ) . This suggested that high doses of 4-AP block the formation of Tau aggregates via a mechanism independent of its convulsant activity . To resolve a mechanism whereby high doses of 4-AP reduced Tau pathology , contrary to our predictions above regarding neural hyperactivity , we considered previous in vitro work that demonstrated high concentrations of 4-AP cause reduced endocytosis of synaptic vesicles ( Cousin and Robinson , 2000 ) . To examine if the inhibitory actions of 4-AP on the abundance of Tau aggregates in our TBI model is consistent with an endocytosis inhibition mechanism , we treated our tau biosensor larvae post-traumatic injury with Pyrimidyn-7 ( P7 ) , a potent dynamin inhibitor that is known to block endocytosis ( McGeachie et al . , 2013 ) , and analyzed the propagation of Tau pathology by quantifying the number of Tau inclusions . Owing to the potency of P7 and its impact on the survival of larvae , we treated the larvae with it for 24 hr at 3 \u03bcM . Similar to the findings with 4-AP , P7 treatments significantly inhibited the formation of Tau4R-GFP+ puncta in TBI larvae ( p=0 . 001 ) ( Figure 6C ) . We assessed further the role of endocytosis by employing another dynamin- inhibitor drug , Dyngo 4a , that is less potent than P7 ( McCluskey et al . , 2013 ) . We obtained similar results in which Dyngo 4a treatments significantly reduced tauopathy in our TBI model ( Figure 6D ) . To determine if these results are applicable to human tau , we induced traumatic brain injury on double-transgenic larvae expressing both human Tau ( the 0N4R human Tau isoform , see Bai et al . , 2007 ) and our Tau biosensor reporter , followed by treatment with either 4-AP or P7 . Apart from the untreated control , both groups treated with 4-AP or P7 exhibited a noticeable reduction in abundance of Tau aggregates . While the decrease in the case of P7 was not statistically significant , statistical analysis showed significance after 4-AP treatments ( p=0 . 0003 ) ( Figure 6E and F ) . These findings confirmed the ability of 4-AP and dynamin inhibitors of reducing human Tau aggregates in our TBI larvae . \n It is well established that TBI induces tauopathy , and over the past decade , numerous in vitro and in vivo studies have supported that Tau proteins possess prion-like properties . Indeed seeding , templated misfolding ( conversion ) and spread to synaptically connected regions has been documented in tauopathies such as AD and FTD ( Ayers et al . , 2018; de Calignon et al . , 2012; Goedert et al . , 2017a; Goedert et al . , 2017b; Iba et al . , 2015; Woerman et al . , 2016 ) . Various mechanisms have been proposed for the transcellular transfer of Tau seeds including release mechanisms via exosomes , or cellular uptake mechanisms via endocytosis ( Demaegd et al . , 2018; Evans et al . , 2018; Wang et al . , 2017; Wu et al . , 2013 ) . Nonetheless , these suggested mechanisms were postulated based on in vitro evidence as there is a lack of appropriate models that can visualize and manipulate the prion-like spread of Tau pathology between tissues in a vibrant brain . It is unclear if these mechanisms are universal in progression of all tauopathies or if there are factors and mechanisms that are unique to each disease . Our zebrafish models allow us to study the progression and spread of TBI-induced tauopathy longitudinally in living animals , an experimental advantage that is unmatched among TBI animal models . Regarding TBI , a large knowledge gap exists regarding how Tau seeds are released and/or internalized by adjacent ( or far-flung ) cells - indeed the prion-like properties of Tau species following TBI had not been assessed until very recently ( Woerman et al . , 2016; Zanier et al . , 2018 ) . Moreover , the focus in the literature has mostly been directed toward repetitive mild trauma as it is most associated with CTE , yet the various forms of TBI all are considered risk factors for neurodegeneration . The recent revelation that most TBI patients , whether they suffered from single or repetitive brain trauma , all exhibited Tau pathology similar to CTE ( Washington et al . , 2016; Zanier et al . , 2018 ) suggests all forms of TBI might incorporate tauopathies . Our mode of TBI on larval zebrafish entails a pressure wave that most closely mimics a blast injury ( e . g . as experienced by military personnel or civilians near an explosion , and presumably producing injury throughout the body ) , but the etiology leading to tauopathy probably has many similarities regardless of the mode of the initiating TBI . We inspected the role of seizure activity and/or neuronal excitability , as well as the role of dynamin-dependent endocytosis , during the progression of tauopathy after TBI . We focussed our attention on seizure activity in part because seizures frequently occur in TBI patients following blast traumatic injury ( Englander et al . , 2014; Kovacs et al . , 2014 ) . We hypothesized that neuronal excitability and seizure activity after TBI can play a role in accelerating the wide dissemination of Tau pathology . As such , we introduced two new approaches to test this hypothesis . The first approach was to engineer a novel in vivo Tau biosensor model in zebrafish that can visualize pathological Tau spreading and accumulation within the intact and vibrant CNS . The Tau biosensor zebrafish express human tau4R-GFP reporter protein , and we confirmed its ability to detect Tau seeds from various sources both in vivo and in vitro , similar to previously engineered in vitro models ( Kaufman et al . , 2016; Sanders et al . , 2014 ) . Our second approach was to introduce and optimize an elegantly simple technique to cause pressure-wave induced TBI , similar to human blast TBI , in zebrafish larvae . We endeavoured to inflict injury on larval zebrafish rather than adults because of the synergistic advantages that larval zebrafish provide: these include economical access to large numbers of individuals and associated statistical power , and the tractability of larvae for high-throughput in vivo screening of therapeutic agents ( Saleem and Kannan , 2018 ) . Larval zebrafish provide a large economic advantage compared to adults , with respect to time , cost per individual and space consumed in animal housing . Moreover , injuring animals in larval stages is viewed as an ethically favorable Replacement [sensu \u2018the three Rs\u2019 of Russell and Burch , 1959] compared to injuring adult subjects . Thus , regardless of any bioethical considerations based on taxonomy , larval fish ( that are accessible early in their development via external fertilization of eggs ) are ethically advantageous to rodents ( that are accessible for TBI only at postnatal stages ) when considering highly invasive procedures like TBI . The latter conclusion relies on the assumption that the knowledge gained is of value , that\u00a0is relevant to appreciating disease etiology . Our data argue that our TBI methods are germane to clinical aetiology , because ( akin to existing animal models of TBI ) we were able to confirm the presence of various markers associated with brain injury , such as cell death , abnormalities in blood flow , hemorrhage and the occurrence of post-traumatic seizures . Recently , post-traumatic seizures were also observed in adult zebrafish when TBI was delivered via focused ultrasound ( Cho et al . , 2020 ) offering an additional opportunity for zebrafish to be an important tool and bridge organism in the field of neurotrauma . The post-traumatic seizures apparent in our TBI model led us to consider the neural events occurring during the TBI , and their potential bearing on the correlation between neural activity and tauopathy . Few studies examine how TBI impacts neuronal circuits , especially in vivo , and these typically consider events several hours or days after brain trauma ( Bugay et al . , 2020 ) . This may be of importance when considering evaluating the reasons behind the developments of post-traumatic seizures and epilepsy . In a controlled cortical impact model of TBI , an initial decrease or loss in neuronal activity is recorded after injury before a rise in neuronal activity is noted ( Ping and Jin , 2016 ) . Whether this occurs in different types of TBI , like blast TBI , was unexamined . To address this , we performed TBI on larval zebrafish expressing CaMPARI , a genetically encoded optogenetic reporter of neural activity . CaMPARI is particularly ideal for this question , as its reportage of neural activity ( a stable and quantifiable shift from green to red fluorescence ) occurs only during user-defined times and that reportage is relatively permanent . This allowed us to quantify the CNS activity that had occurred during TBI , by characterizing the ratio of red:green fluorescent emission using confocal microscopy after the TBI injury was completed . This approach therefor allows relatively easy access to quantifying neural activity during injury in an unencumbered freely\u00a0swimming animal . Here , we revealed for the first time a snapshot of neurons becoming active at the moment of TBI . Our results demonstrated an increase in neuronal excitability upon TBI , which may contribute to the frequency of post-traumatic seizures observed in our model , other blast TBI models and TBI patients ( Bugay et al . , 2020 ) . The increases in neuronal activity were especially prominent in the hindbrain; this may be due to this region being susceptible to injury in our paradigm , and/or represent an output that is related to increased movement ( e . g . this region is home to robust motoneurons that would be hyperactive during seizures ) . It will be of interest to resolve what types of neurons and neurochemistry are most impacted by the injury . Notably , the subsequent Tau4R-GFP aggregates were also most prominent in this hindbrain region , and while this could be coincidental , or perhaps an artefact of a hidden differential Tau4R-GFP abundance , it is also possibly a result of increased neural activity . Regarding the etiology of tauopathy subsequent to TBI , the CaMPARI quantification provided us important validation that neural activity was substantively impacted by TBI , complementing the evidence of increased seizure-like movements . This supported our rationale that convulsant and anti-convulsant drug treatments might modulate neural activity and thereby accelerate or decelerate tauopathy accumulation . Indeed , we had noted the occurrence of post-traumatic seizures in most of our TBI samples , which is in agreement with the prevalence of seizures in blast TBI patients and TBI rodent models ( Bugay et al . , 2020; Kovacs et al . , 2014 ) . However , whether post-traumatic seizures contribute to prion-like spreading of Tau pathology ( observed after TBI or not ) was unknown . Beyond TBI , several investigations have supported an association between Tau pathology and seizures ( S\u00e1nchez et al . , 2018; Tai et al . , 2016 ) . Studies on epileptic human temporal structure revealed accumulation of Tau aggregates ( S\u00e1nchez et al . , 2018 ) . In 3XTg AD mice , induced chronic epilepsy was associated with changes of inter-neuronal p-Tau expression ( Yan et al . , 2012 ) . Additionally , data obtained from postmortem analysis of patient tissues with AD and drug resistant epilepsy uncovered a correlation between symptomatic seizures , increased Braak staging and accelerated Tau accumulation ( Thom et al . , 2011 ) . Interestingly , the presence of tau deposits in epileptic patients and the similarity of its pathology to CTE suggest a conceivable role for seizures influencing the progression of Tau pathology in a similar manner to TBI ( Puvenna et al . , 2016 ) . Indeed , our data from the application of the convulsant kainate here support the role of post-traumatic seizure in enhancing Tau abundance and cell death in our TBI model ( Figure 5G , H ) . This finding is in line with observations in a patient with epilepsy and a history of head injury , in which progressive Tau pathology was noted ( Geddes et al . , 1999; Thom et al . , 2011 ) . Intriguingly , reducing seizure activity after TBI via anti-convulsant drugs was able to significantly reduce tauopathy and cell death , providing further evidence of the relationship between seizures and tauopathy in TBI ( Figure 5F , G and H ) . The mechanism of drug action appears to be dominated by its anticonvulsant properties , because its effects were reversed by co-application of convulsants . Thus , anti-convulsants are intriguing as a route to slowing progression of tauopathy following TBI , and it is encouraging that they are already commonly deployed to prevent post-traumatic seizures . One particular convulsant drug , 4-AP , inhibited tauopathy in our TBI model ( Figure 6A and B ) , contrary to our hypothesis that seizure intensity is positively correlated with tauopathy following TBI . 4-AP is a voltage-gated potassium channel blocker that enhances neuronal firing activity and has been used often in zebrafish seizure studies ( Kanyo et al . , 2020b; Kasatkina , 2016; Liu and Baraban , 2019; Lundh , 1978; Winter et al . , 2017 ) . Yet , 4-AP is rarely administered for prolonged treatments such as those we deployed here , for\u00a0example past studies rarely exceed one hour of 4-AP ( Winter et al . , 2017 ) . Thus , we considered that our high dose and prolonged stimulation with 4-AP may have led to off-target effects; we confirmed this insomuch that the 4-AP\u2019s inhibition of tauopathy was not related to its convulsant properties ( as determined by 4-AP\u2019s effects being unaltered by potent anti-convulsants ( Figure 6B ) ) . Indeed , previous in vitro work revealed high concentrations or prolonged stimulation with 4-AP has off-target effects via inhibiting dynamin , which is important for the endocytosis of synaptic vesicles at the nerve terminals ( Cousin and Robinson , 2000 ) . The inhibition of endocytosis observed in that study was independent of 4-AP-dependent seizure activity . We further queried the potential role of dynamin-dependent endocytosis in the prion-like progression of Tau pathology after TBI by applying endocytosis inhibitors that target dynamin . Dynamin is a GTPase involved in two mechanisms of endocytosis that are important for synaptic vesicle transport ( Singh et al . , 2017 ) . Empirical work on human stem-cell-derived neurons has indicated that Tau aggregates are internalized via dynamin-dependent endocytosis and that blocking other endocytosis pathways independent of dynamin , such as bulk endocytosis and macropinocytosis , did not disrupt Tau uptake ( Evans et al . , 2018 ) . On the contrary , inhibiting dynamin significantly decreased the internalization of Tau aggregates . Our results are in line with the previously mentioned findings that show Tau progression in TBI models depends on dynamin-dependent endocytic pathways - blocking them with two different inhibitors ( and with 4-AP ) dramatically lessened the abundance of Tau seeds ( Figure 6C\u2013F ) . Hence , our findings not only provide in vivo validation of past in vitro works , but also suggest mechanisms underlying prion-like spreading of Tau seeds in TBI and CTE that could aid in developing therapeutic strategies . Our tauopathy biosensor , human Tau4R-GFP , was deployed in vivo and uniquely able to detect significant increases ( and decreases ) in the abundance of Tau aggregates following various insults and treatments , typically in a dose-dependent manner and in harmony with expected trends . Considering this success , it remains perplexing and intriguing that a subset of larvae exhibit GFP+ Tau puncta despite receiving no known tauopathy-inducing insults . This suggests that\u00a0the larvae express the transgene at a level near to a threshold for producing spontaneous aggregates . We performed selective breeding to minimize these occurrences and tentatively believe , after too few generations , that genetics of the fish is a factor \u2013 substantial genetic variation exists in zebrafish in-bred lines ( Balik-Meisner et al . , 2018; Guryev et al . , 2006 ) . However , we acknowledge the variation could be a minor technical artefact rather than biological . It remains to be determined if our biosensor can self-aggregate in some situations , or if these aggregates represent transient moments of imbalance in the proteostatic cycle of Tau aggregation and clearance . Regardless of this variation amongst individual larvae , the effects of neurotrauma and drug interventions were rational and robust when considering the mean of several animals; the large sample sizes available with the larval zebrafish model can overcome some of this variability . More optimistically , this inter-individual variation and stochastic appearance of tauopathy , in a high-throughput model , could be leveraged to newly appreciate aspects of spontaneous AD or other non-familial tauopathies . Regardless , future work will also need to characterize the biochemistry and biophysics of the human Tau inclusions in zebrafish compared to patients or rodent models . Regarding our TBI methods , further refinements may yet be able to improve consistency of the injury and reduce the apparent variability between individuals . This variability is real , but somewhat offset by the large sample sizes attainable: our TBI methods offer the potent advantages of zebrafish larvae with respect to genetic and drug accessibility in high-throughput formats , while also retaining the critical in vivo complexity required to investigate disease etiology and treatments . Further , it remains to be established if the mechanisms we reveal are ubiquitous across the various forms of TBI: our model fills a gap by supplying a rare \u2018closed head\u2019 TBI model ( as opposed to the majority of animal models that access the brain by removing skull elements prior to brain injury , see exceptions by Meconi et al . , 2018; Mychasiuk et al . , 2014 ) . Our model might be most relevant to brain trauma experienced by the human fetus ( e . g . during car collisions or domestic abuse ) , considering the developmental stage and aqueous media . Moreover , the injury induced herein is presumably not limited to the brain , and probably injures various tissues including the spinal cord; this should be considered when interpreting the data . Further work is also needed to appreciate how the physics of our blast injury is altered by occurring at a small scale ( e . g . larval brain is\u00a0<500 \u03bcm ) . At this point , we are left to assume that the cellular and physiological aspects of TBI we consider here are sufficiently similar across all classes of TBI , and thus the knowledge gleaned may be variably applicable . Finally , we have chosen to restrict our analysis to study of larval fish . While this offers many logistical and ethical advantages detailed above , it limits our study to acute effects occurring over the course of several days . Conclusions from such work , once refined and validated using the power of the in vivo zebrafish larva model , should be tested in rodent models where it is equally time-consuming to assess the long-term efficacy of treatments on these progressive late-onset dementias . Currently , no available treatments are applicable to all tauopathies , which remain as devastating and inevitably fatal dementias . Zebrafish larvae , fostered by appropriate innovations , now offer a potent complement both to rodent models of TBI and to cellular models of tauopathy . Our engineered fish allowed us to reveal post-traumatic seizures as a druggable mechanistic link between TBI and the prion-like progression of tauopathy . Intriguingly , our conclusions have potential for translation to TBI clinics where anti-convulsants are already in use as prophylactics for post-traumatic epilepsy , though further work remains to address if they mitigate ( the risk or severity of ) later progression of CTE , AD or other tauopathies . \n Zebrafish were raised and maintained following protocol AUP00000077 approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee: Biosciences at the University of Alberta , operating under the guidelines of the Canadian Council of Animal Care . The fish were raised and maintained within the University of Alberta fish facility under a 14/10 light/dark cycle at 28\u00b0C as previously described ( Westerfield , 2000 ) . To engineer the transgenic Tau4R-GFP reporter zebrafish , the human wild-type MAPT sequence of the four-microtubule binding repeat domain ( aa 244\u2013372 of the full-length TAU 2N4R , NCBI NC_000017 . 11 , protein id NP_005901 ) with a seven-amino acid C-terminal linker ( RSIAGPA ) was ordered as a gene block from IDT . The gene block was subcloned into a middle entry cloning vector ( Multisite Gateway technology , ThermoFisher ) . This was recombined with the p5E-enolase2 and p3E-GFP components into destination vector pDestTol2CG2 of the Tol2kit ( Guo and Lee , 2011; Kwan et al . , 2007 ) . The destination vector contained a reporter construct [encompassing EGFP driven by the cardiac myosin light chain ( clmc ) promoter that helps identify stable transgenic zebrafish] . The resulting plasmid pDestTol2CG2 . eno2:Tau4R-GFP was delivered in a 10 \u03bcl injection solution including 750 ng/\u03bcl of the construct mixed with 250 ng/\u03bcl Tol2 transposase mRNA , 1 \u03bcl of 0 . 1M KCL , and 20% phenol red . The solution was injected into the single-cell embryos of Casper zebrafish line ( transparent zebrafish line ) ( White et al . , 2008 ) . Injected embryos were screened for mosaic expression of the Tau4R-GFP transgene at 2 days post-fertilization ( dpf ) using a Leica M165 FC dissecting microscope . F0 mosaic fish were raised to adulthood and outcrossed . Successful F1 embryos were identified by their abundant expression of Tau4R-GFP in the CNS and the green heart marker . The stable transgenic line Tg ( eno2:Hsa . MAPT_Q244-E372\u2212EGFP ) ua3171 was assigned the allele number ua3171 . An equivalent transgenic zebrafish biosensor was engineered to detect human SOD1 aggregation . Subcloning from existing vectors ( Pokrishevsky et al . , 2018 ) produced pDestTol2CG2 . eno2:SOD1-GFP and similar transgenesis methods engineered the Tg[eno2:SOD1-GFP] zebrafish line that was assigned allele number ua3181 . To move the Tau4R-GFP reporter above into a vector appropriate for cell culture , BamHI and Xhol nuclease restriction enzymes were employed to remove the Tau4R-GFP fragment from pDest tol2CG2 . eno2 . Tau4R-GFP . pA . The Tau4R-GFP fragment was subcloned into the pCDNA3 . 1 vector using a T4 DNA ligase enzyme . Sequencing of the cloned vector with the following reverse primer for GFP ( TCTCGTTGGGGTCTTTGCTC ) confirmed the proper orientation . Purification of the plasmid was conducted with the Qiagen purification kit . HEK293T cells were grown in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium ( GibcoTM , ThermoFisher ) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin . All cells were maintained at 37\u00b0C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator . For passaging cells , cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline ( PBS ) before trypsinization with 0 . 05 Trypsin-EDTA ( Sigma Aldrich , T4174 ) . HEK293T cells were plated at 1 \u00d7 106 cells/well in six-well plates . Cells were transfected with pcDNA3 . 1 . Tau4R-GFP plasmid 24 hr after plating using lipofectamine 2000 reagents according to the manufacturer\u2019s guidelines . Briefly , 4 \u03bcg of pcDNA3 . 1 . Tau4R-GFP was diluted in 250 \u03bcl of Opti-MEM media ( GibcoTM , ThermoFisher ) . The expression of the fluorescent reporter was confirmed the next day through microscopic analysis . A stable cell line was established by replating the transfected cells at a 1:10 dilution and selecting in DMEM media containing 1200 \u03bcg/ml geneticin ( GibcoTM , ThermoFisher ) . Expression of the fused fluorescent proteins in the stable cell lines was confirmed using fluorescent microscopy . Polyclonal cells and monoclonal cells were grown to confluency in 10 cm dishes , then stored in liquid nitrogen until use . For cell lysate preparation , cells were washed with cold PBS , then collected and incubated with cold lysis buffer ( 150 mM NaCl , 50 mM Tris-HCl ( pH 8 ) , 1 mM EDTA and 1% Nonidet P-40 ) supplemented with protease inhibitor ( Cocktail Set III; Millipore ) for 10 min on ice . Cells were lysed using a bio-vortexer homogenizer for 20 s for two rounds . The lysate was centrifuged at 13 , 000 rpm for 10 min at 4\u00b0C . The supernatant was collected , and the protein concentration was determined using the Qubit Protein Assay Kit ( Invitrogen ) . For zebrafish brain lysate preparation , the brains of adult zebrafish were dissected . Brains were homogenized in cell lysis buffer ( 20 mM HEPES , 0 . 2 mM EDTA , 10 mM NaCl , 1 . 5 mM MgCl2 , 20% glycerol , 0 . 1% Triton-X ) with protease inhibitor and phospSTOP ( Sigma-Aldrich ) in the case of pt406 Tg . Brains were lysed using a bio-vortexer homogenizer and sonicated for 3 s for one round . Samples were centrifuged as above and concentration of the samples was assessed in a Qubit fluorometer ( Invitrogen ) . For immunoblotting , 30\u201340 \u03bcg of the total protein was combined with 2X sample buffer ( Sigma-Aldrich ) and boiled for 10 min before loading in 11% SDS-PAGE . Electrophoresis was performed using the Bio-Rad Power PAC system in running buffer ( 25 mM Tris base , 192 mM glycine and 0 . 1% SDS ) . The gel was transferred to a PVDF membrane using a wet transfer system . All membranes were blocked for one hour in protein-free blocking buffer PBS ( ThermoFisher ) or TBST with 5% milk and then incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4\u00b0C with gentle agitation . The primary antibodies used in this study include rabbit monoclonal GFP ( abcam , EPR14104 ) at 1:3000 dilution , rabbit anti-\u03b2-actin ( Sigma-Aldrich , A2066 ) at 1:10 , 000 . All membranes were washed three times with 1X TBST before incubation with secondary antibody ( goat-anti-mouse ) HRP or HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit at 1:5000 dilution ( Jackson ImmunoResearch ) for 1 hr at room temperature . The membranes were washed for the final time before visualization using Pierce ECL Western Blotting Substrate ( ThermoFisher ) on a ChemiDoc ( Biorad ) . For stripping and re-probing , the membranes were stripped using mild stripping buffer ( 199 . 8 mM Glycine , 0 . 1% SDS , and 1% Tween 20 with a pH of 2 . 2 ) before blocking them and repeating the methods described before . Larvae were fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde , either 1 day after being subjected to TBI or following the subsequent application of drugs as indicated . Immunostaining of Activated-Caspase3 on whole-mount larvae was carried out as previously described ( Duval et al . , 2014 ) . Larvae were washed with 0 . 1 M PO4 with 5% sucrose three times before washing with 1% Tween in H2O ( pH 7 . 4 ) , and then \u221220\u00b0C acetone . Larvae were incubated in PBS3+ containing 10% normal goat serum for 1 hr and then incubated with primary antibody with 2% normal goat serum in PBS3+ . The primary antibody used was polyclonal Anti-Active-Caspase-3 ( BD Pharmingen , 559565 ) at 1:500 dilution . The secondary antibody applied was Alexafluor 647 anti-rabbit at 1:200 dilution ( Invitrogen ) . Larvae were counterstained with 4' , 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole ( DAPI ) ( ThermoFisher ) for 30 min . Brains from TgTauP301L mice and non-Tg littermate controls ( 129/SvEvTac genetic background ) were provided by Dr . David Westaway and Dr . Nathalie Daude ( Eskandari-Sedighi et al . , 2017; Murakami et al . , 2006 ) . Crude brain homogenate was prepared by homogenizing the brains to 10% ( wt/vol ) in calcium- and magnesium-free DPBS that included a protease inhibitor and phosSTOP , using a glass homogenizer and power gen homogenizer ( Fisher Scientific ) . Samples were then centrifuged at 13 , 000 rpm for 15 min at 4\u00b0C . The clear supernatant was collected , aliquoted and stored in \u221280\u00b0C until use for experiments . The phosphotungstate anion ( PTA ) -precipitated brain homogenate was prepared as described ( Woerman et al . , 2016 ) . Briefly , 10% ( wt/vol ) brain homogenate was prepared as reported above and mixed with a final concentration of 2% sarkosyl ( Sigma Aldrich ) and 0 . 5% benzonase ( Sigma Aldrich , E1014 ) , and then incubated at 37\u00b0C for two hours with constant agitation in an orbital shaker . Sodium PTA ( Sigma Aldrich ) was dissolved in ddH2O , and the pH was adjusted to 7 . 0 before it was added to the samples at a final concentration of 2% ( vol/vol ) . The samples were then incubated overnight under the previous conditions . The next day , the samples were centrifuged at 16 , 000 g for 30 mins at room temperature . The supernatant was discarded , while the resulting pellet was resuspended in 2% ( vol/vol ) PTA in ddH2O ( pH 7 . 0 ) and 2% sarkosyl in DPBS . The samples were next incubated for one hour before the second centrifugation . The supernatant was removed and the pellet was re-suspended in DPBS . An aliquot of 5 \u03bcl of PTA purified brain homogenate was employed for electron microscopy ( EM ) analysis to confirm the presence of fibrils in each sample . Synthetic human Tau protein ( wildtype full-length monomers ) was purchased as a lyophilized powder ( rPeptide , T-1001\u20132 ) and resuspended in ddH2O at a concentration of 2 mg/ml . The recombinant protein was fibrillized as described previously ( Guo and Lee , 2011 ) . Recombinant Tau was incubated with 40 \u03bcM low-molecular-weight heparin and 2 mM DTT in 100 mM sodium acetate buffer ( pH 7 . 0 ) at 37\u00b0C , thereafter being agitated for seven days . The fibrillization mixture was centrifuged at 50 , 000 g for 30 mins , and the resulted pellet was resuspended in 100 mM sodium acetate buffer ( pH 7 . 0 ) without heparin or DTT . Successful fibrillization was verified by EM . Negative staining for EM analysis of fibrils was conducted as described elsewhere ( Eskandari-Sedighi et al . , 2017 ) . Briefly , 400 mesh carbon-coated copper grids ( Electron Microscopy Sciences ) were glow-discharged for 40 s before adding the sample aliquots . PTA-purified brain homogenates or synthetic Tau fibrils ( 5 \u03bcL ) were applied on the top of the grid for 1 min . These grids were washed using 50 \u03bcl each of 0 . 1M and 0 . 01M ammonium acetate and negatively stained with 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a050 \u03bcl of filtered 2% uranyl acetate . After removing excess stain and drying , the grids were examined with a Tecnai G20 transmission electron microscope ( FEI Company ) with an acceleration voltage of 200 kV . Electron micrographs were recorded with an Eagle 4k\u00a0\u00d7\u00a04 k CCD camera ( FEI Company ) . Polyclonal Tau4R-GFP cells were plated at 2 \u00d7 105 per well in 24-well plates . Cells were transduced the next day , using 40 \u03bcl of 10% clarified brain homogenate combined with Opti-MEM to a final volume of 50 \u03bcl . A further 48 \u03bcl of Opti-MEM and 2 \u03bcl of Lipofectamine-2000 ( Invitrogen ) was added to the previous Opti-MEM mixture to a total volume of 100 \u03bcl and incubated for 20 min . The liposome mixture was applied to the cells for 18 hr , and cells were then washed with PBS , trypsinized , and re-plated on coated coverslips ( ThermoFisher ) for imaging and analysis . For PTA-precipitated brain homogenate , 1:10 dilution of precipitated fibrils was used for the transfection . 5 \u03bcl of PTA-purified fibrils was diluted in 45 \u03bcl Opti-MEM to a final volume of 50 \u03bcl . The previous Opti-MEM mixture was added to 47 \u03bcl of Opti-MEM and 3 \u03bcl of Lipofectamine-2000 and incubated in room temperature for 2 hr as described in Safar et al . , 1998; Woerman et al . , 2016 . The mixture was added to cells , washed after 18 hr and re-plated before analysis exactly as mentioned previously . Prior to imaging , transfected cells were fixed 2% PFA in PBS for 15 mins . Samples were then washed twice with PBS then stained with DAPI ( 1:3000 from 1 mg/ml stock ) for six mins . Cells were imaged using a Zeiss LSM 700 scanning confocal microscope featuring Zen 2010 software ( Carl Zeiss , Oberkochen , Germany ) . Due to increased brightness of the GFP+ puncta formed after introduction of brain homogenate , GFP exposure was minimized for those cells only . To quantify the GFP+ puncta , a total of nine images were collected and analyzed for each condition , each with\u00a0~100 cells . DAPI-positive nuclei were utilized to determine the number of cells per image . The number of cells with inclusions ( multiple nuclear inclusions or one cytoplasmic puncta ) were counted and the percentage was calculated . Injections into the larval zebrafish brain ( intraventricular space ) were performed as described previously with few modifications ( Gutzman and Sive , 2009 ) . Embryos at 2 dpf ( days post-fertilization ) were removed from their chorions and anesthetized with 4% tricaine ( MS-222 , Sigma Aldrich ) . The embryos were placed in a 1% agarose-coated dish with small holes . Under a stereomicroscope , the immobilized embryos were oriented so that the brain ventricles were accessible for injections . The injection was carried out via pulled capillary tubes mounted in a micromanipulator . The injection volume was calibrated to 5 nL by injection into mineral oil and measurement with an ocular micrometer . Thereafter , the needle containing the injection solutions was placed through the roof plate of the hindbrain and 5\u201310 nL of either 10% clarified brain homogenate ( TgTauP301L mice or wildtype littermate control ) , or synthetic tau , were mixed with 20% dextran Texas Red fluorescent dye ( Invitrogen ) and injected into the ventricles . For all the brain injection experiments , an uninjected control group and control group injected only with 20% red dextran fluorescent dye in PBS were included . After the injections , embryos were screened using a Leica M165 FC dissecting microscope and appropriately injected larvae were gathered for further analysis . The injections were considered appropriate if they had sharp edges and non-diffuse dye in the ventricle ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . Larvae receiving improper injections , in which the needle was inserted too deep in the brain ventricles resulting in the dye being visible outside the ventricle space and/or in the yolk , were excluded from analysis . For the microscopic analysis of GFP-positive inclusions , larvae that were either injected or treated with traumatic injury , along with the control groups , were anesthetized via tricaine at the indicated time point ( two , three , four , or five days post-injection ( dpi ) or post-traumatic injury ( dpti ) depending on the experiment ) . Images for GFP-positive puncta on the brain area or lateral line above the spinal cord were taken using a Leica M165 FC dissecting microscope and the number of GFP-positive puncta were manually counted . To induce TBI , 10\u201312 unanesthetized larvae ( 3 dpf ) were loaded into a 10-ml syringe with 1 ml of E3 media . The syringe was blocked using a stopper valve to ensure no larvae or media left the syringe upon compression of the plunger . The syringe was held vertical using a metal tube holder at the bottom end of a 48\u2019 tube apparatus . A defined weight ( between 30 and 300 g ) was dropped manually from the top of the tube . The tube diameter was matched to ( slightly greater than ) the weight\u2019s diameter to enhance repeatability . This was either done once or repeated three times , with either 65 or 300 g weights . Once larvae were subjected to the TBI , they were moved back to a petri dish with fresh media and maintained for further analysis . To characterize the dynamic changes in pressure that occurred within the syringe during the TBI events , the stopper valve attached to the syringe ( described immediately above ) was replaced with a piezoresistive pressure transducer ( #MLT844 AD Instruments , Colorado Springs , CO ) . Events were monitored via a PowerLab 2/26 data acquisition device and LabChart 7 software ( AD Instruments ) . The pressure transducer was zeroed to report gauge pressure ( pressure changes relative to atmospheric pressure ) and was calibrated against a manometer ( Fisherbrand Traceable from Thermoscientific , Ottawa ON ) . After each weight drop , the syringe apparatus was reset to remove any air bubbles and the pressure transducer was zeroed . Time courses of induced pressure were reported over a 350 msec time frame with 50 msec of base line recording , while mean and maximum pressure values were calculated from the initial 300 msec following the impact of the weight . Abnormalities of blood flow and circulation resulted from TBI was detected 5 to 10 mins after larvae were subjected to TBI . The blood flow in the tail area of zebrafish larvae , either those subjected to TBI or uninjured controls , was recorded using Leica DM2500 LED optical microscope . The seizure-like behavior and activity of zebrafish larvae post-traumatic injury experiment was quantified via behavioral tracking software as described in our recent publications ( Kanyo et al . , 2020a; Leighton et al . , 2018 ) . Briefly , control larvae or larvae subjected to TBI using 65 g weight , were placed individually in wells of 96-well plates . The locomotor and seizure activity were assessed 40 min after the TBI through EthoVision XT-11 . 5 software ( Noldus , Wageningen , Netherlands ) . The hypermotility of larvae is a manifestation of Stage I and Stage II seizures ( previously defined via application of epileptic drugs ) , whereas more intense Stage III seizures are arrhythmic convulsions that manifest as reduced macroscopic movement in this assay ( Kanyo et al . , 2020a; Leighton et al . , 2018; Liu and Baraban , 2019 ) . We used a recently described ( Kanyo et al . , 2020b ) in-house allele of transgenic zebrafish expressing the calcium sensor CaMPARI , line Tg[elavl3:CaMPARI ( W391F+V398L ) ]ua3144 . Due to a federal moratorium on importing zebrafish into Canada ( Hanwell et al . , 2016 ) , we remade these fish using the Tol2 transgenesis system ( Fisher et al . , 2006 ) and a vector gifted by Eric Schreiter\u2019s lab and published in Fosque et al . , 2015 . The transgene was bred onto the transparent Casper background . Larvae with robust CNS expression of CaMPARI were loaded into a 20 ml syringe containing 1 ml E3 media ( prepared as per recipe in Westerfield , 2000 , but without ethylene blue ) and were exposed to a 405 nm LED array ( Loctite ) , which illuminated the syringe entirely . Larvae were exposed for 10 s , with the LED array at a distance of 7 . 5 cm from the syringe , while being subjected to TBI using the 300 g weight as described above . Following this photoconversion of CaMPARI during TBI , larvae were anesthetized in 0 . 24 mg/mL tricaine methanesulfonate ( MS-222 , Sigma Aldrich ) and embedded in 2% low-gelling agarose ( A4018 , Sigma Aldrich ) for analysis under confocal microscopy . CaMPARI imaging began with acquisition of Z-stacks ( 8 \u00b5m steps ) using a laser point-scanning confocal microscope ( Zeiss 700 , 20x/0 . 8 Objective ) , and visualized as maximum intensity projections . The hindbrain area was analyzed , as it was the brain region most responsive to TBI . To specifically isolate the brain regions and obtain data points , a 3D area was isolated by creating a surface with Imaris 7 . 6 ( Bitman , Zuerich ) and the mean fluorescence intensities of the green and red channel intensities were calculated . Data points were presented as a red/green ratio for each individual larva and interpreted as relative neural activity , which is defined as red photoconverted CaMPARI in ratio to green CaMPARI ( Fosque et al . , 2015; Kanyo et al . , 2020b ) . Tau biosensor larvae were treated with 20 \u03bcM of the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 at 2dpf , following injections with brain homogenate from Tg human Tau mice . The treatment was left for 48 hr before changing the media and evaluating the percentage of larvae developing GFP+ puncta in the brain region . For Kainic acid or kainate treatment ( KA ) , the doses ( 5 , 50 , 100 , 150 , and 200 \u03bcM ) were selected based on previous use of KA in zebrafish larvae ( Kim et al . , 2010; Menezes et al . , 2014 ) , and added within 6 hr after TBI . For 4-aminopyridine ( 4-AP ) , one of two doses of 4-AP ( 200 or 800 \u03bcM ) were added either six or 24 hr after TBI , as indicated . For Retigabine ( RTG ) treatment , 10 \u03bcM was used to treat TBI larvae beginning 6 hr after TBI . Doses of 4-AP and RTG were selected based on our previous experience using them to affect seizures ( Kanyo et al . , 2020b ) . Unless otherwise stated , KA , 4-AP and/or RTG were applied to larvae for 38 hr , then a fresh drug-free E3 media was added . The formation of GFP-positive puncta was analyzed at four to five days post injury . Pyrimidyn-7 ( P7 ) , the dynamin inhibitor , was purchased at a 50 mM concentration supplied in DMSO ( Abcam ) . Larvae that were subjected to TBI were treated within six hours following the injury with 3 \u03bcM of P7 . The dose was chosen based on the previous use of the P7 drug on zebrafish larvae ( Verweij et al . , 2019 ) . The larvae were incubated with the drug for 20 hr , after which they were transferred to a fresh plate with drug-free media . Dyngo 4a , another dynamin inhibitor ( McCluskey et al . , 2013 ) , was purchased from ( Abcam ) and 4 \u03bcM of Dyngo 4a was used to treat larvae as previously explained with P7 . The formation and abundance of GFP-positive puncta was evaluated as previously described at 4 days post-traumatic injury ( dpti ) . For some experiments , the \u2018Tau biosensor\u2019 transgenic zebrafish were bred to a separate Tg line that express human four repeat TAU Tg ( eno2:hsa . MAPT-ires-egfp ) Pt406 throughout the zebrafish CNS ( Bai et al . , 2007 ) . All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism Software ( Version 7 , GraphPad , San Diego , CA ) . Sample sizes appropriate for our conclusions were estimated iteratively as the variance in each of our new methods became apparent; dose-response curves and significant differences amongst these dose were used to judge that any detected impacts of subsequent interventions would be valid . All experiments were independently replicated at least twice , individual larvae were the sampling unit ( reported on Figures ) , and no outliers or other data were excluded . The experimenters were blinded to the treatments prior to quantifying outcomes . Paired t-tests were used to compare between two groups , except for when sample sizes were too small to assess normality wherein Mann-Whitney tests were used . For comparison between three or more groups at various time points or the same time point , two-way and ordinary one-way ANOVA were used followed by post-hoc Mann-Whitney U tests and Kruskal-Wallace multiple comparison tests , respectively .", "headings": ["Abstract", "Introduction", "Results", "Discussion", "Materials and methods"], "keywords": ["neuroscience"], "id": "elife-58744-v1"}
{"lay_summary": "People differ a lot from one another in terms of their personality , behaviour and lifestyle . This individuality is attributed to the different regions in the brain , and the strength of communication between them . The connectivity pattern between these areas is thought to be as unique as a fingerprint . If the connections are weak or disrupted it can play a role in conditions such as schizophrenia , depression or Alzheimer\u2019s disease . It is thought that the strength of the connection depends on how strongly the nerve cells in these regions communicate . But are these individual differences solely caused by different strengths of connection , or could other factors contribute to them ? Now , Bijsterbosch et al . found that the size , shape and exact position of the brain regions was also strongly linked to the different behaviours of individuals . The study used brain scans , behavioural tests and questionnaires from a large database about lifestyle choices and demographics , to analyse the relationship between the different brain features of healthy individuals . The results showed that the variations in the brain regions were linked to many behavioural factors including intelligence , life satisfaction , drug use and aggression problems . Moreover , Bijsterbosch et al . showed that the existing methods for estimating the strength of connection between brain regions could reveal more about the spatial layout of these regions than the actual connection strength between them . This suggests that new approaches are needed to properly evaluate the strength of the connections . Some psychiatric and neurological diseases may be associated with changes in size and position of the different regions in the brain . In future , the findings of this study could be applied to individuals affected by such conditions , to see if the location of a region could be used as a diagnostic indicator .", "article": "Brain connectivity is often considered in terms of the communication between functionally distinct brain regions . Many studies have investigated the extent to which patterns of coupling strength between multiple neural populations relates to behaviour . For example , studies have used \u2018functional connectivity fingerprints\u2019 to characterise individuals' brain activity . Here , we investigate the extent to which the exact spatial arrangement of cortical regions interacts with measures of brain connectivity . We find that the shape and exact location of brain regions interact strongly with the modelling of brain connectivity , and present evidence that the spatial arrangement of functional regions is strongly predictive of non-imaging measures of behaviour and lifestyle . We believe that , in many cases , cross-subject variations in the spatial configuration of functional brain regions are being interpreted as changes in functional connectivity . Therefore , a better understanding of these effects is important when interpreting the relationship between functional imaging data and cognitive traits . \n The organisation of the human brain into large-scale functional networks has been investigated extensively over the past two decades using resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging ( rfMRI ) . Spontaneous fluctuations in distinct brain regions ( as measured with rfMRI ) show temporal correlations with each other , revealing complex patterns of functional connectivity ( FC ) ( Biswal et al . , 1995; Friston , 1994 , 2011 ) . Extensive connectivity between cortical areas and with subcortical brain regions has long been considered a core feature of brain anatomy and function ( Crick and Jones , 1993 ) , and dysfunctional coupling is associated with a variety of neurological and psychiatric disorders including schizophrenia , depression , and Alzheimer\u2019s disease ( Castellanos et al . , 2013 ) . Given the great potential neuroscientific and clinical value of rfMRI , it is important to determine which aspects of rfMRI data most sensitively and interpretably reflect trait variability across subjects . At a neural level , potential sources of meaningful cross-subject variability include: ( i ) the strength of the functional coupling ( i . e . interactions ) between two different neural populations ( \u2018coupling\u2019 ) , and ( ii ) the spatial configuration and organisation of functional regions ( \u2018topography\u2019 ) . In this study , we aim to identify how these key aspects of rfMRI data influence derived measures of functional connectivity and how they relate to interesting trait variability in behaviour and lifestyle across individuals . Our findings reveal variability in the spatial topography of functional regions across subjects , and suggest that this variability is the primary driver of cross-subject trait variability in correlation-based FC measures obtained via group-level rfMRI parcellation approaches . These results have important implications for future rfMRI research , and for the interpretation of FC findings . A commonly applied approach used to derive FC measures from rfMRI data is to parcellate the brain into a set of functional regions ( \u2018nodes\u2019 ) , and estimate the temporal correlations between pairs of node timeseries ( \u2018edges\u2019 ) to build a network matrix ( Smith et al . , 2013b ) . This approach has previously been likened to a fingerprint , enabling the unique identification of individuals , and the prediction of behavioural traits such as intelligence ( Finn et al . , 2015; Passingham et al . , 2002 ) . Of particular interest is the ability of network matrices to explain cross-subject variability in behaviour and performance on psychometric tests . To this end , Cross Correlation Analysis ( CCA ) was previously adopted to link a \u2018positive-negative\u2019 axis of behaviour to network matrices in data from the Human Connectome Project ( Smith et al . , 2015 ) . CCA allows the comparison of a set of variables obtained from rfMRI ( such as network matrices of edges ) to a set of behavioural variables by estimating independent linear transformations for the two sets of variables such that they are maximally correlated . Here , we replicated this previous work in a larger subject sample ( almost double the number of individuals ) , and adopt CCA to determine which key aspect of rfMRI data is uniquely associated with behaviour . Parcellation methods that can be used to estimate network matrices include the use of anatomical , functional , and multi-modal atlases ( Glasser et al . , 2016; Tzourio-Mazoyer et al . , 2002; Yeo et al . , 2011 ) , with functional parcellations often being data driven via techniques such as clustering and independent component analysis ( ICA ) ( Beckmann et al . , 2005; Craddock et al . , 2012 ) . Data-driven approaches such as ICA have been used to identify consistent large-scale resting state networks ( Damoiseaux et al . , 2006 ) and to characterise FC abnormalities in a variety of mental disorders ( Littow et al . , 2015; Pannekoek et al . , 2015 ) . Any given parcellation is typically defined at the group level , and hence additional steps are required to map a group-level parcellation onto individual subjects\u2019 data ( that has undergone registration to a common space ) , in order to obtain subject-specific parcel timeseries and associated connectivity edge estimates . Timeseries derived from hard ( binary , non-overlapping ) parcellations are often obtained using a simple masking approach ( i . e . extracting the averaged BOLD timeseries across all voxels or vertices in a node ) , whereas ICA parcellations ( partially overlapping , soft parcellations that contain continuous weights ) are mapped onto single-subject data using dual regression analysis or back projection ( Calhoun et al . , 2001; Filippini et al . , 2009 ) . The first stage of a dual regression approach involves multiple spatial regression of group ICA maps into each preprocessed individual dataset to obtain subject-specific timeseries; the second stage is a multiple temporal regression of these stage one timeseries into the same preprocessed dataset to obtain subject-specific spatial maps . Note , dual regression is , to some extent , expected to underestimate subject-specific spatial variability because it involves post-hoc regressions of a group-level set of spatial maps , which are unlikely to be an accurate model for the data of individual subjects . Indeed , previous work has shown that , in the presence of spatial variability or inaccurate intersubject alignment , these common methods for mapping group parcellations onto individuals do not recover accurate subject-specific functional regions , and this can severely impact the accuracy of estimated timecourses and derived FC edges ( Allen et al . , 2012; Smith et al . , 2011 ) . More recently , several studies have developed more thorough characterisations of the patterns of spatial variability in network topography across subjects ( i . e . spatial shape , size and position of functional regions ) ( Glasser et al . , 2016; Gordon et al . , 2017a , 2017b; Laumann et al . , 2015; Swaroop Guntupalli and Haxby , 2017; Wang et al . , 2015 ) . For example , Glasser et al . showed that the subject-specific spatial topology of area 55b in relation to the frontal and premotor eye fields substantially diverged from the group average in 11% of subjects ( Glasser et al . , 2016 ) . In addition , the size of all cortical areas , including large ones like V1 , varies by twofold or more across individuals ( Amunts et al . , 2000; Glasser et al . , 2016 ) . This extensive presence of spatial variability across individuals highlights the need for analysis methods that are adaptive and better able to accurately capture functional regions in individual subjects . Another approach that aims to achieve a more accurate subject-specific description of this spatial variability is PROFUMO , which simultaneously estimates subject and group probabilistic functional mode ( PFM ) maps and network matrices ( instead of separate parcellation and mapping steps ) . Specifically , PROFUMO is a matrix factorisation model that decomposes data into estimates of subject-specific spatial maps , time courses , and amplitudes using a variational Bayesian approach with both spatial and temporal priors that seek to optimise for both spatial map sparsity and temporal dynamics consistent with haemodynamically\u00a0regularised neural activity ( Harrison et al . , 2015 ) . PROFUMO adopts a hierarchical approach by iteratively optimising subject and group estimates ( instead of first estimating group components using group ICA and separately mapping these onto subjects using dual regression ) , and is therefore expected to more accurately capture subject-specific spatial variability than does dual regression . Other approaches are available to obtain group and subject parcellations in one step , for example using a groupwise normalised cut spectral clustering approach ( Shen et al . , 2013 ) . In the present study , we show that the spatial variability across subjects captured in PFMs is strongly associated with behaviour . Conceptually , network edges are commonly thought of as reflecting coupling strength between spatially separated neuronal populations . However , as discussed above , edge estimates are highly sensitive to spatial misalignments across individuals . Additionally , correlation-based edge estimates are influenced by the amplitudes of localised spontaneous rfMRI fluctuations ( Duff et al . , 2018 ) , which have been shown to capture trait variability across subjects , and state variability within an individual over time ( Bijsterbosch et al . , 2017 ) . These findings demonstrate the sensitivity of edge-strength estimates to many different types of subject variability , and highlight the need to identify which aspects of FC tap most directly into behaviourally\u00a0relevant population-level variability . Here , we investigate the complex relationships between different features of an rfMRI dataset and also the associations with variability across individuals in terms of their performance on behavioural tests , their lifestyle choices , and demographic information . Using data from the Human Connectome Project ( HCP ) , we provide evidence for systematic differences in the spatial organisation of functional regions . We then use simulations that manipulate aspects of the data such that , for example , only cross-subject spatial variability is present in the data ( i . e . by fixing edge strength to be the group average for each individual ) to investigate whether these differences reflect meaningful cross-subject information and drive edge estimates for several common FC approaches . \n To determine whether a given rfMRI-derived FC measure contains meaningful cross-subject information rather than random variability , we adopted an approach that makes use of the extensive set of behavioural , demographic , and lifestyle data acquired in the HCP . Our first analysis aims to determine which measures obtained from rfMRI and task data most strongly relate to interesting behavioural variability across individuals . Using Canonical Correlation Analysis ( CCA ) , we extracted population modes of cross-subject covariation that represent maximum correlations between combinations of variables in the subject behavioural measures and in the fMRI-derived measures , uncovering multivariate relationships between brain and behaviour . For example , previous work has used CCA on HCP data to identify a mode of population covariation that linked a positive-negative axis of behavioural variables to patterns of FC edge strength ( Smith et al . , 2015 ) . A specific pattern of connectivity , primarily between \u2018task-negative\u2019 ( default mode ) regions ( Raichle et al . , 2001 ) , was found to be linked to scores on positive factors such as life satisfaction and intelligence , and inversely associated with scores on negative factors such as drug use . CCA works by finding a linear combination of behavioural measures ( V ) that is maximally correlated with a linear combination of rfMRI-derived measures ( U ) . CCA scores for each subject are obtained for the behavioural and fMRI-derived measures ( V and U ) , which represent the subject\u2019s position along the population continuum for the latent CCA variable ( s ) . The key result of a CCA analysis for each mode of covariation is the correlation between U and V , denoted rUV , which describes the strength of the multivariate brain-behaviour relationship . Given that CCA explicitly optimises rUV , it is essential to perform permutation testing in order to test the significance of the CCA result . To determine which behavioural measures contribute strongly to the CCA result , V is subsequently regressed into original non-imaging variables ( Figure 1B; although interpretation of these results is complicated by behaviour-behaviour correlations ) . Additionally , U is used to visualise variation at both the population extremes ( see Figure 2 below and Figure 2\u2014figure supplements 2\u20137 ) , and across the full population continuum ( Supplementary video files ) . We applied a separate CCA analysis for each of the various fMRI-derived measures ( including spatial , network matrix , and amplitude measures ) . The results ( Figure 1 and Supplementary file 1a and b ) reveal that highly similar associations with behaviour and life factors occur across a wide range of different fMRI-derived measures . Correlating the behavioural subject weights ( V ) across the different CCA instances in Figure 1 shows that a similar behavioural mode is obtained from the independent instances of CCA ( particularly for those CCAs that have a high rU-V and low PU-V; Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . Mapping these subject weights onto behaviour through correlation reveals consistent positive associations with , for example , fluid intelligence , life satisfaction , and delayed discounting , and consistent negative correlations with use of tobacco , alcohol and cannabis . All behavioural correlations with mean correlation r>|0 . 25| ( chosen for visualisation purposes ) are shown in Figure 1B . The results show that spatial features such as PFM subject spatial maps and subject task contrast maps are strongly associated with behaviour . Overall , these findings reveal that a large variety of fMRI measures have similarly strong associations with behaviour . Direct comparison between the results in Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1a ) and the HCP_MMP1 . 0 parcellation ( e . g . the 360-region \u2018Glasser parcellation\u2019 [Glasser et al . , 2016] ) and against associated fractional surface area ( in native space as a ratio to total surface area , for each of the 360 parcels in the HCP_MMP1 . 0 parcellation ) is challenging due to the large difference in the number of subjects ( n\u00a0=\u00a0819 for Figure 1 and n\u00a0=\u00a0441 for HCP_MMP1 . 0 ) . Therefore , we have included an analysis on all PFM metrics in a reduced number of subjects ( the same n\u00a0=\u00a0441 subjects ) in order to facilitate direct comparison between these two recent parcellation approaches that both aim to achieve accurate detection of subject-specific spatial boundaries ( Supplementary file 1b ) . These results show that spatial features from a variety of sources ( surface area , multimodal parcellation and PFMs ) are strongly associated with measures of behaviour and lifestyle . Also note that network matrices obtained by the HCP_MMP1 . 0 parcellation are more predictive of behaviour than are PFM network matrices . For correlation-based parcellated FC estimates ( network edges ) , a common assumption is that functional coupling is primarily reflected in the edges . In theory , true network coupling information can be manifested along a continuum ranging from spatial maps to network matrices . On one extreme , coupling information is purely contained in spatial maps , as is the case when performing temporal ICA ( where the temporal correlation matrix is by definition the identity matrix\u00a0[Smith et al . , 2012] ) . On the other extreme , coupling information can be fully contained in network matrices as is often assumed to be the case when using an individualised hard parcellation ( however , coupling can only be represented fully in edge estimates if all subjects are perfectly functionally aligned to the parcellation , and if the node timeseries amplitudes do not contain useful cross-subject information ) . It is likely that the dimensionality of the decomposition may influence this; for example , for a low-dimensional decomposition ( into a small number of large-scale networks ) , much cross-subject variation in functional coupling is likely to occur between sub-nodes of the networks , which is therefore more likely to be represented in the spatial maps , whereas in a higher dimensionality decomposition this information is more likely to be represented in the network matrix . However , the results in Figure 1 show that this CCA mode of population covariation is significantly present in both spatial maps and network matrices for both low- and high-dimensional decompositions ( ICA 25 and 200 ) . Therefore , the potential role of dimensionality is not sufficient to explain the common information present in spatial maps , timeseries amplitudes , and network matrices . The presence of this behaviourally meaningful spatial variability is somewhat surprising , because these data were aligned using a Multimodal Surface Matching ( MSM ) approach ( Robinson et al . , 2014; 2018 ) , driven by both structural and functional cortical features ( including myelin maps and resting state network maps ) . MSM has been shown to achieve very good functional alignment compared with other methods , and particularly compared with volumetric alignment approaches or surface-based approaches that use cortical folding patterns rather than areal features ( Coalson et al . , 2018 ) . However , residual cross-subject spatial variability is still present in the HCP data after the registration to a common surface atlas space ( in part due to the constrained parameterisation of MSM and in part because weighted regression subject maps used to drive MSM may not fully capture all spatial variability ) . In line with this , approaches which are expected to better identify residual subject spatial variability ( specifically , PFM spatial maps and subject task contrast maps in Figure 1 ) show strong correspondence between spatial variability and behaviour/life-factor measures . To better understand what spatial features represent behaviourally\u00a0relevant cross-subject information , we visually explored what aspects of the PFM spatial maps contributed to the CCA result in Figure 1 by calculating representative maps at extremes of the CCA mode of population covariation ( based on CCA subject scores ) . While the PFM maps are estimated using the full set of cortical and subcortical grayordinates , we focus on cortical findings because these contribute most strongly to the CCA results . The results reveal complex changes in spatial topography ( Figure 2 , Figure 2\u2014figure supplements 2\u20137 , and Videos 1\u20139 . For example , comparing left versus right panels shows the right inferior parietal node of the DMN extending farther into the intraparietal sulcus ( in the vicinity of area IP1 [Choi et al . , 2006; Glasser et al . , 2016] ) in subjects who score higher on the behavioural positive-negative mode of covariation . Qualitative inspection of Figure 2\u2014figure supplements 2\u20137 suggests that many of the difference maps show notable bilateral symmetry . Figure 1 showed that functionally-relevant cross-subject variability is represented in a variety of different measures derived from both resting state and task fMRI . These widespread similarities in correlations with behaviour across a range of measures invite the question of whether the same type of trait variability is meaningfully and interpretably reflected in a wide range of rfMRI measures , or whether ( for example ) estimates of network matrices may instead primarily reflect trait variability in spatial topography or amplitude ( and not coupling strength ) . Therefore , we wanted to determine to what extent correlation-based FC measures derived from rfMRI can be influenced by specific aspects of the rfMRI data such as true topography and true coupling . To this end , we generated simulated datasets based on the original PFM subjects and/or group spatial maps and timeseries . By holding either the individual ( simulated ) subjects\u2019 spatial maps or the network matrices fixed to the group average we eliminated specific forms of underlying subject variability from the simulated data ( Figure 3 ) . Note , we used PFMs in order to generate simulated data because the PROFUMO model separately estimates spatial maps , network matrices and amplitudes , thereby allowing each aspect to be fixed to the group average prior to generating simulated data using the outer product ( as described in detail in Equation ( 1 ) , and in the section on \u2018Creating simulated data\u2019 in the Material and methods ) . Previous simulation results have shown that PROFUMO is able to accurately estimate spatial maps and network matrices in the presence of cross-subject variability in spatial topography , relative strength of subregions , and between-mode connectivity ( Harrison et al . , 2015 ) . The aim of the simulation analyses was to determine which features in the rfMRI data are likely to be most strongly reflected in network matrices estimated from rfMRI data . We assess this in terms of the amount of variability across subjects that can be explained , as this is the most relevant application in biomarker studies and in neuroimaging research more generally . Timeseries were extracted from both the simulated and original datasets , and network matrices were estimated . Each simulated dataset was assessed using three metrics: ( i ) comparing subject-specific simulated and original network matrices ( Znetwork matrix in Table 1 ) , ( ii ) comparing cross-subject variability in the simulated and original network matrices ( Rcorrelation in Table 1 ) , and ( iii ) determining how much of the cross-subject variability in simulated and original network matrices is behaviourally informative using CCA ( see Table 1 legend ) . The results ( Table 1 and Supplementary file 1c and d ) show that , when the subject-varying aspects of the simulations were exclusively driven by spatial changes across subjects ( with the predefined network matrix and amplitudes being identical for all subjects ) , up to 62% ( i . e . square of Rcorrelation\u00a0=\u00a00 . 79 from Supplementary file 1d \u2018maps only\u2019 ) of the cross-subject variance present in the network matrices obtained from the original data was regenerated . Hence , this finding reveals that very similar network matrices can be obtained for any individual subject even if the only aspect of the rfMRI that is varying across subjects is the topographic information in PFM spatial maps . In addition , the variance that can be explained by spatial maps is behaviourally relevant; the CCA results were similarly strong ( typically having the same permutation-based p-values ) from simulated network matrices driven purely by spatial changes , compared with those obtained from the original dataset . The influence of amplitudes on FC estimates was relatively minor ( less than 2 . 5% of variance was explained by amplitude in all our simulations; i . e . square of Rcorrelation\u00a0=\u00a00 . 15 from Table 1 \u2018amplitudes only\u2019 ) , although , when amplitudes were combined with spatial maps feeding into the simulations , the amplitudes did in most cases result in an increase in original network matrix regeneration . Given the complex information present in PFM spatial maps , the effect of spatial information on network matrices can result from cross-subject variability in: ( i ) network size , ( ii ) relative strength of regions within a given network , or ( iii ) size and spatial location of functional regions . We performed two further tests to distinguish these influences by thresholding and binarising the subject-specific spatial maps used to create the simulated data . Maps were either thresholded using a fixed threshold ( removing the influence of relative strength ) , or ( separately ) using a percentile threshold ( removing the influence of relative strength and size , as the total number of grayordinates in binarised PFM maps is fixed across subjects and PFMs ) . The role of subject-varying spatial maps in driving the resulting estimated network matrices remains strong when highly simplified binarised maps are used to drive the simulations ( Supplementary file 1e ) , further supporting our interpretation that the results are largely driven by the shape of the functional regions ( i . e . variability in the location and shape of functional regions across subjects ) , rather than by size or local strength . The results presented above show that a large proportion of the variance in estimated network matrices is also represented in spatial topography . This suggests either that cross-subject information is represented in both the coupling strength between neural populations and in the \u2018true\u2019 underlying spatial topography , or that edge estimates obtained from rfMRI data primarily reflect cross-subject spatial variability ( which indirectly drives edge estimates through the influence of spatial misalignment on timeseries extraction , particularly when group parcellations are mapped onto individual subjects in the case of imperfect alignment ) . To test these hypotheses further , we investigated the unique information contained in spatial maps and network matrices using a set of 15 ICA basis maps derived from HCP task contrast maps ( Figure 4A ) . These basis maps can be thought of as the spatial building blocks that can be linearly combined to create activation patterns for any specific HCP task contrast , and can be considered here to be another functional parcellation . The advantage of using basis maps derived from task data is that the tasks essentially act as functional localisers that allow for the precise localisation of task-related functional regions within an individual; results at a single-subject level are not influenced in any way , including spatially , by the group results , as they are derived via the standard task-paradigm analysis ( i . e . which relies solely on temporal information , and is not influenced by the group-level maps ) . The equivalence between group- and subject-level contrasts ( i . e . the inherent assumption in any group-level analysis , namely that the group \u20182BK-0BK\u2019 contrast map directly relates to any subject-level \u20182BK-0BK\u2019 contrast ) means that any combination of group-level contrasts is equally valid as a combination at the subject-level , but with the advantage that the resulting subject maps will be faithful to the precise location of functional regions that the subject-specific contrast maps capture . Hence , subject-based task basis maps are the most accurate description of subject-specific locations of functional regions , at least with respect to those regions identifiable from the range of tasks used . To investigate the implications of these task-localised maps on typical rfMRI analyses , either group-based task basis maps or subject-based task basis maps were entered into a dual regression analysis against subjects\u2019 resting-state fMRI data to obtain network matrices ( from dual regression stage one timeseries ) and rfMRI-based spatial maps ( from dual regression stage 2 ) for each subject ( Figure 4B ) . Subsequently , CCA was performed to determine how well each of the group-based and subject-task-based rfMRI maps and network matrices was able to predict behavioural variability . Furthermore , a \u2018partial CCA\u2019 was performed to characterise the unique variance that task rfMRI maps carry over and above network matrices , and vice versa . Here , we regressed any variance explained by network matrices out of the spatial maps prior to running the \u2018partial CCA\u2019 to determine the unique information contained in spatial maps ( and vice versa , i . e . , regressed any variance explained by spatial maps out of network matrices before running the \u2018partial CCA\u2019 ) . The results from the CCAs against behavioural measures show that subject-specific spatial maps ( derived\u00a0from\u00a0either subject- or group-based\u00a0task-fMRI\u00a0maps ) capture more behavioural information than network matrices ( and continue to reach significance in the partial CCA ) , consistent with the PFM spatial results presented in Figure 1 . The full CCA result is marginally stronger ( \u2206ruv=0 . 005 , p=0 . 46 ) for group-task-based rfMRI spatial maps compared with subject-task-based rfMRI spatial maps . None of the partial CCA results for network matrices reach significance , suggesting that network matrices do not contain any unique trait-level information that is not also captured by spatial variability . Note that dual regression maps derived from both group-task-based and subject-task-based templates capture unique subject-specific spatial variation in the partial CCA results , consistent with significant CCA results for ICA25 and ICA200 in\u00a0Figure 1 . Importantly , subject-task-based rfMRI network matrices explain the behavioural data considerably less well than group-based task-rfMRI network matrices ( difference: p=0 . 0005 for full network matrices ) , confirming that spatial information is a significant factor in estimated network matrices . Hence , subject spatial variability is more uniquely represented in the spatial information for subject-task-based estimates , and therefore does not filter through into the network matrices ( marked \u201c\u00a7\u201d ) . Taken together , these results show that , while network matrices obtained from dual regression against group-level maps do contain behaviourally relevant cross-subject information , this can be almost completely explained by variability in spatial topographical features across subjects ( to the extent that we can detect it ) . Hence , dual regression network matrices ( obtained from multiple regression against group spatial maps ) apparently contain little unique cross-subject information regarding coupling strength that is not also reflected in spatial topographical organisation . However , it is possible that network matrices obtained using parcellation methods and timeseries extraction approaches that are better able to capture subject-specific spatial variability ( such as the HCP_MMP1 . 0 parcellation ) do contain unique cross-subject information; further research is needed to test this possibility . Additionally , network matrices may contain unique state-level information relevant to ongoing behaviour ( e . g . in a task paradigm ) . \n Here , we have identified a key aspect of rfMRI data that directly reflects interesting variability in behaviour and lifestyle across individuals . Our results indicate that spatial variation in the topography of functional regions across individuals is strongly associated with behaviour ( Figure 1 ) . In addition , network matrices ( as estimated with masking or dual regression against group-level hard or soft parcellations ) reflect little or no unique cross-subject information that is not also captured by spatial topographical variability ( Figure 4 and Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . This unexpected finding implies that the common interpretation of FC as representing cross-subject ( trait ) variability in the coupling strength of interactions between neural populations may not be a valid inference ( although within-subject state-dependent changes in coupling may still be reflected in FC measures ) . Specifically , we show that up to 62% of the variance in rfMRI-derived network matrices ( a measure commonly taken as a proxy for coupling ) can be explained purely by spatial variability . These findings have important implications for the interpretation of FC and may contribute to a deeper mechanistic understanding of the role of intrinsic FC in cognition and disease ( Mill et al . , 2017 ) . Our findings are consistent with previous research that has highlighted the presence of structured cross-subject spatial variance in both functional and anatomical networks ( Glasser et al . , 2016; Gordon et al . , 2017a; Noble et al . , 2015; Sabuncu et al . , 2016; Tong et al . , 2017; Xu et al . , 2016 ) . Furthermore , recent work has shown that resting state spatial maps can be used to predict task activation maps from individual subjects very accurately ( Tavor et al . , 2016 ) , and that interdigitated and highly variable subnetworks can be identified within individuals ( Braga and Buckner , 2017 ) . Therefore , the presence of behaviourally relevant cross-subject variance in maps of functional ( co- ) activation in itself is not surprising . However , the fact that these variations in spatial topographical features capture a more direct and unique representation of subject variability than temporal correlations between regions defined by group parcellation approaches ( coupling ) , was unexpected . The implication of this finding is that the cross-subject information represented in commonly adopted \u2018connectivity fingerprints\u2019 largely reflects spatial variability in the location of functional regions across individuals , rather than variability in coupling strength ( at least for methods that directly map group-level parcellations onto individual data ) . Specifically , our partial CCA results ( Figure 4 ) show that network matrices ( as often estimated ) contain little unique trait-level cross-subject information that is not also reflected in the spatial topographical organisation of functional regions . How the functional organisation of the brain is conceptualised and operationally defined is of direct relevance to the interpretation of these findings . Some hard parcellation models of the human cortex ( such as the Gordon and Yeo parcellations [Gordon et al . , 2016; Yeo et al . , 2011] ) aim to fully represent connectivity information in the edges ( i . e . correlations between node timeseries ) . Thus , hard parcellations of this type assume piecewise constant connectivity within any one parcel ( i . e . each parcel is assumed to be homogeneous in function , with no state- or trait-dependent within-parcel variability in functional organisation ) . In contrast , the HCP_MMP1 . 0 multimodal parcellation presumes within-area uniformity of one or more major features , but overtly recognises within-area heterogeneity in other features , including connectivity , most notably for distinct body part representations ( \u2018sub-areas\u2019 ) of the somatomotor complex . Soft parcellation models ( such as PROFUMO [Harrison et al . , 2015] ) allow for the presence of multiple modes of ( potentially overlapping ) functional organisation . Therefore , PFMs represent connectivity information through complex interactions between amplitude and shape in the spatial maps , and through network matrices . Our findings show that both the PROFUMO and the multimodal parcellation models successfully capture behaviourally\u00a0relevant cross-subject spatial variability ( Supplementary file 1b ) , but that the precise location of where this spatial variability is represented overlaps only modestly between the two approaches ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 7 ) . Given the differences in the key assumptions made by the two models ( i . e . binary parcellation versus multiple modes of functional organisation ) , this is not unexpected . However , it does highlight the need for further research into the optimal representation of ( subject-specific ) functional organization in the brain . For most of the results presented in this work , we estimated spatial information using functional data ( either resting or task fMRI data ) . While a comprehensive investigation of related anatomical features is beyond the scope of this work , we did identify significant correlations between fractional surface area size and subject CCA weights ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 7 ) . This result suggests that anatomical variability in the cortical extent of a number of higher level sensory and cognitive brain regions may contribute to the overall findings presented here . Further research into the relationship between structural features and functional connectivity measures , and their contribution to trait-level subject variability is needed to test this hypothesis . Our findings are relevant to a wide variety of approaches used to study connectivity . For example , our simulation results ( Table 1 and Supplementary file 1c and d ) reveal similar results regardless of whether we adopt a dual-regression or a masking approach to obtain timeseries , and the findings also do not differ qualitatively according to whether full or partial correlation is used to estimate network matrices . Therefore , our findings are relevant to any approach that is based on timeseries extracted from functional regions defined at the group-level ( including graph theory methods and spectral analyses ) . The implications of this work may also extend beyond resting-state fMRI . For example , generative models such as dynamic causal modelling ( DCM ) are increasingly used to stratify patient populations ( Brodersen et al . , 2014 ) , and to achieve predictions for individual patients ( Stephan et al . , 2017 ) . Previous work has shown that including parameters for the position and shape of functional regions in individual subjects into the model improves DCM results and better differentiates between competing models ( Woolrich et al . , 2009 ) . It is currently unknown to what extent cross-subject variability observed with these timeseries-based fMRI metrics reflects true coupling between neural populations , rather than being indirectly driven by spatial variability and misalignment , but given that many of these studies are conducted using alignment methods that perform substantially worse than the MSMAll surface-based alignment used in this study ( Coalson et al . , 2018 ) , this is likely a significant confound for such studies . Going forward , it is important to disambiguate the influence of spatial topography to enable the estimation of fMRI measures that uniquely reflect coupling strength between neural populations . Significant advances have already been made in recent years in order to tackle the issue of spatial misalignment across individuals . For example , the HCP data used in this work were spatially aligned using the multimodal surface mapping ( MSM ) technique , which achieves very good functional alignment by using features that are more closely tied to cortical areas ( although note that , since the time of the HCP release , refinements to the MSM algorithm and regularisation have resulted in further improvements in the observed functional alignment of HCP data [Robinson et al . , 2014 , 2018] ) . Therefore , gross misalignment is unlikely to play a role in our results . In fact , some of the behaviourally relevant variability may have been \u2018corrected\u2019 in the MSM pipeline prior to our analyses ( indeed , the same positive-negative mode of population covariation is identified when running the CCA on MSM warp fields; and the fractional surface area results in Supplementary file 1b and Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 7 reflect the full variability from native space , and are not affected by the alignment accuracy ) . Therefore , it is possible that the degree to which spatial information may influence FC estimates varies considerably across studies , depending on the spatial alignment algorithm that was used , and the amount of subject spatial variability this has removed . It is encouraging that significant efforts have recently gone into the methods for more accurately estimating the spatial location of functional parcels in individual subjects in recent years ( Chong et al . , 2017; Glasser et al . , 2016; Gordon et al . , 2016; Hacker et al . , 2013; Harrison et al . , 2015; Varoquaux et al . , 2011; Wang et al . , 2015 ) , and into advanced hyperalignment approaches ( Chen et al . , 2015; Guntupalli et al . , 2016; Guntupalli and Haxby , 2017 ) . The present results highlight the importance of such advances , and call for the continued development , comparison , and validation of such approaches . In conclusion , we have demonstrated that spatial topography of functional regions are strongly predictive of variation in behaviour and lifestyle factors across individuals , and that timeseries-based methods ( as often estimated based on group-level parcellations ) contain little unique trait-level information that is not also explained by spatial variability . \n For this study , we used data from the Human Connectome Project S900 release ( 820 subjects with fully complete resting-state fMRI data , 452 male , mean age 28 . 8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03 . 7 years old ) ( Van Essen et al . , 2013 ) . Data were acquired across four runs using multiband echo-planar imaging ( MB factor 8 , TR\u00a0=\u00a00 . 72 s , 2 mm isotropic voxels ) ( Moeller et al . , 2010; U\u011furbil et al . , 2013 ) . Data were preprocessed according to the previously published pipeline that includes tools from FSL , Freesurfer , HCP\u2019s Connectome Workbench , multimodal spatial alignment driven by myelin maps , resting state network maps , and resting state visuotopic maps ( \u2018MSMAll\u2019 ) , resulting in data in the grayordinate coordinate system ( Fischl et al . , 1999; Glasser et al . , 2013 , 2016; Jenkinson et al . , 2012; Marcus et al . , 2013; Robinson et al . , 2014; Smith et al . , 2013a ) . ICA-FIX-cleanup was performed on individual runs to reduce structured noise ( Griffanti et al . , 2014; Salimi-Khorshidi et al . , 2014 ) . ICA-FIX achieves 99% sensitivity and 99% specificity on HCP data when compared to manual classification by trained raters ( Smith et al . , 2013a ) . Only subjects with the full 4800 resting state timepoints ( 4 scans of 1200 TRs each ) were included for the analyses performed in this work . A detailed overview of quality assessment in the Human Connectome Project was previously published ( Marcus et al . , 2013 ) . HCP data are freely available from https://db . humanconnectome . org . The version of MSMAll that is compatible with the approach implemented for the alignment of HCP data can be found here: http://www . doc . ic . ac . uk/~ecr05/MSM_HOCR_v2/ ( Robinson et al . , 2017 ) . Matlab code used in this work can be found here: https://github . com/JanineBijsterbosch/Spatial_netmat ( Bijsterbosch , 2017; copy archived at https://github . com/elifesciences-publications/Spatial_netmat ) . Data from many figures in this study is freely available\u00a0at\u00a0https://balsa . wustl . edu/study/show/kKM0 . In order to obtain estimates of the spatial shape and size of functional networks for every subject , we decompose the HCP data into a set of probabilistic functional modes ( PFMs ) via the PROFUMO algorithm ( Harrison et al . , 2015 ) . A set of M PFMs describe each subject\u2019s data ( G grayordinates; T time points; Ds\u2208RV\u00d7T ) in terms of a set of subject-specific spatial maps ( Ps\u2208RV\u00d7M ) , amplitudes ( hs\u2208RM ) and timecourses ( As\u2208RM\u00d7T ) , all of which are linked via the outer product model: ( 1 ) Ds = Ps * diag ( hs ) * As + \u03b5 These subject-specific decompositions are linked by a set of hierarchical priors . In the spatial domain , the group-level parameters encode the grayordinate-wise means , variances and sparsity of the subject maps , while in the temporal domain , the group-level priors constrain the subject-level network matrices ( note that the component amplitudes and hierarchical priors are recent extensions to the PFMs model and were not included in the original PROFUMO paper [Harrison et al . , 2015] ) . The PROFUMO framework gives us sensitive estimates of key subject-level parameters , while ensuring that there is direct correspondence between PFMs across subjects . PROFUMO was run on the rfMRI data from all 820 subjects with a dimensionality of 50 PFMs . Importantly , the signal-subspace of any given subject\u2019s dataset can be straightforwardly reconstructed from a set of modes via equation [1] , and this can be used to generate the simulated data as described below . For the ICA decompositions , amplitudes were estimated for each subject and component as the temporal standard deviation of the timeseries obtained from stage 1 of a dual regression analysis . Full and regularised partial correlation matrices were also calculated from these timeseries . The Tikhonov regularisation rho used during estimation of the partial correlation matrices was set to 0 . 01 for the ICA 25 , 200 and PFM data ( according to previous optimisation results ) . For high-dimensional parcellations ( Yeo and HCP_MMP1 . 0 ) , the rho was optimised by finding the maximum correlation between subject and group-average ( using rho\u00a0=\u00a00 . 01 ) network matrices across a range of rho ( 0 . 01:0 . 5 ) , leading to rho\u00a0=\u00a00 . 03 for Yeo and rho\u00a0=\u00a00 . 23 for HCP_MMP1 . 0 results . Lastly , the subject spatial maps obtained from stage 2 of a dual regression analysis were used . Similarly , for the PROFUMO decomposition , the PFM amplitudes , subject spatial maps and timeseries were used . For the HCP_MMP1 . 0 spatial results , either group-level or subject-specific node parcellations were used ( Hacker et al . , 2013 ) . The subject-specific parcellations contain missing nodes ( parcels ) in some subjects ( Glasser et al . , 2016 ) . Hence , for partial network matrices , the rows and columns in the covariance matrix were set to the scaled group average prior to inverting the covariance matrix . In the resulting network matrices , the rows and columns relating to missing nodes were set to the group average ( for both partial and full network matrices ) . Before performing CCA , missing nodes were accounted for by estimating the subject-by-subject covariance matrix one element at a time , ignoring any missing nodes for any pair of subjects . The nearest valid positive-definite covariance matrix was subsequently obtained using nearest\u00a0SPD in Matlab ( http://uk . mathworks . com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/42885-nearestspd ) , prior to performing singular value decomposition as described below . Each CCA analysis finds a linear combination of behavioural and life-factor measures ( V ) that is maximally correlated with a linear combination of rfMRI-derived measures ( U ) ( Hotelling , 1936 ) : Y*A=U \u223cX*B=V . Y is the set behavioural measures , and X are the rfMRI-derived measures ( i . e . spatial maps , or network matrices , or signal amplitudes ) , ~indicates that U and V are approximately equal . A and B are optimised such that the correlation between U and V is maximal . Summary measures from CCA include the correlation between ( paired columns of ) U and V , and the associated p-values ( derived from permutation testing over n\u00a0=\u00a0100 , 000 permutations ) for the first one or more CCA modes . To create the inputs to the CCA , a set of nuisance variables were regressed out of both the behavioural measures and the amplitudes , network matrices and spatial maps , as done in ( Smith et al . , 2015 ) . Subject covariance matrices were subsequently estimated for the amplitudes , network matrices and for all spatial maps ( by summing the covariance matrices of individual spatial maps ) . Then , a singular value decomposition was performed on the subject covariance matrices and the first 100 eigenvectors were entered into the CCA ( against 100 eigenvectors obtained from behavioural variables as explained in Smith et al . , 2015 ) . In addition to reporting the CCA results for the strength of the canonical correlation between imaging and non-imaging measures and the associated p-value ( rU-V and PU-V ) , we also report the correlation between the CCA subject weights and the weights for the ICA 200 partial network matrices ( rU-Uica ) . The reason for including this correlation is to facilitate direct comparison to previously published CCA results from HCP data ( Smith et al . , 2015 ) . However , this earlier finding should not be taken as the gold standard CCA result . The rU-Uica correlation we report is the maximum correlation found between the first CCA mode from the ICA 200 partial network matrices , and any of the 100 modes of population covariation obtained for the comparison CCA result ( i . e . the maximum correlation may not be with the strongest CCA mode ) . Confidence intervals for CCA results in Table 1 were obtained using surrogate data for both the brain-based CCA input matrix and the behaviour CCA input matrix . To generate the surrogate data , row and column wise correlations of the original CCA input matrices were maintained using a multivariate normal random number generator ( mvnrnd . m in Matlab ) . A total of 1000 instances of surrogate data were used to obtain 2 . 5\u201397 . 5% confidence intervals around rU-V . For visualisation and interpretation purposes , we created videos of the spatial variability along the axis of the behavioural CCA mode of population covariation . For this , we took the U resulting from the CCA between PFM spatial maps and behaviour , and created a linearly spaced vector that spans just over the full range of U ( extending beyond the lowest and highest measured subject score by 10% of the full range ) . As the CCA is linear , it is straightforward to project a set of U values back to form a rank-one reconstruction of the original space , which in this case is a set of spatial maps . This sequence of spatial maps is an approximation to the spatial variability that is encoded along the previously reported positive-negative axis . These are used as the frames for Videos 1\u20139 , and for the illustrative examples shown in Figure 2 and Figure 2\u2014figure supplements 2\u20137 . The two rfMRI parcellation methods included in Supplementary file 1b ( HCP_MMP1 . 0 and PFM ) explicitly aim to capture cross-subject variability in the spatial location of functional regions . The subject spatial maps estimated by both methods are strongly associated with cross-subject behavioural variability ( when matching the sample size rU-V did not significantly differ , and subject weights of the strongest CCA results were moderately correlated rU-U\u00a0=\u00a00 . 55 ) . Therefore , it is of interest to compare these results in more detail , to determine whether cross-subject variability is represented similarly for the two approaches . Furthermore , given that fractional surface area ( the fraction of cortex occupied by each area in the multimodal HCP_MMP1 . 0 parcellation ) was also strongly predictive of behaviour ( Supplementary file 1b ) , we investigated the potential relationship between rfMRI-based PFM weights , multimodally\u00a0defined cortical areal boundaries ( HCP_MMP1 . 0 parcellation ) , and structural variation in fractional surface area . To this end , we averaged CCA subject weights obtained from two separate CCA results ( PFM spatial maps - behaviour , and HCP_MMP1 . 0 spatial maps - behaviour ) . These averaged subject weights were subsequently correlated against fractional surface area , and against subject-specific PFM and HCP_MMP1 . 0 spatial maps ( grayordinate-wise ) , to investigate which brain regions contribute strongly to the association with behaviour , and to compare these localised effects across methods/modalities . In order to create simulated datasets for each subject , we took the outer product between PFM spatial maps and timeseries . Compared with data that is completely simulated , this approach has the advantage of keeping many features in the data ( such as the types of structured noise that are present , the signal-to-noise ratio , and the autocorrelation structure ) , while still achieving investigator control of specific aspects of interest . Data from each run ( 1200 time points ) was processed separately through the simulation pipeline , including the following steps: The PFM subject spatial maps contain a relatively complex set of information . This may include relative differences in amplitude in different brain regions that are part of the same mode , which effectively reflect connectivity rather than spatial shape and size . In order to exclude these potential connectivity-related aspects of the spatial maps and isolate the role of spatial shape , we simplified the spatial maps for some of the simulations presented . For this , the spatial maps were thresholded at a very liberal threshold of 1 ( arbitrary units specific to the PFM algorithm ) and binarised . The sign was retained such that grayordinates in the subject PFM maps with values\u00a0>\u00a01 were set to one and grayordinates with values <-1 were set to \u22121 and all others to zero . A liberal threshold was purposefully used as we wanted to retain extended ( broad , low ) shape information , and just remove any information encoded in the ( relative ) grayordinate amplitudes . Using a fixed threshold across subjects retains cross-subject variability in the size of networks . To further remove this source of information and focus purely on the shape of networks , we applied a percentile threshold such that the size of networks is fixed across subjects ( grayordinates\u00a0>95th percentile set to one and grayordinates\u00a0<5th percentile set to \u22121 , leading to each individual PFM map having the same size of 4564 1s and 4564\u00a0\u20131s across all subjects ) . The results of simulations where the maps were modulated in this way prior to calculating the simulation\u2019s space-time outer product are presented in Supplementary file 1e , including results for which the maps were both thresholded and binarised , percentile thresholded and binarised , and also results for maps that were thresholded ( at 1 ) but not binarised . Given that variability between subjects is of primary interest in rfMRI research , this analysis aimed to directly compare the cross-subject variability present in a range of measures obtained from the original data . Between-subject correlation matrices were calculated from network matrices ( ICA25 , ICA200 and PFM50 ) , from PFM amplitudes and from spatial maps ( ICA25 and ICA200 dual regression stage two spatial maps , and PFM50 spatial maps ) . These subject by subject correlation matrices were reshaped after discarding the diagonal , and full and partial correlations were calculated between the subject correlation matrices ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . To obtain a basis set of spatial maps based on task contrast data , we performed a spatial ICA ( with a dimensionality of 15 ) on the concatenated group-averaged task contrast maps ( a total of 86 maps , 47 of which are unique ) . The ICA dimensionality was determined based on the proportion variance explained in the PCA data reduction step ( 99 . 0% for d\u00a0=\u00a015 ) . Spatial ICA was performed on the group-average task contrasts maps to avoid the correspondence problem that would arise if ICA were applied separately to individual subject task contrast maps . This resulted in a set of ICA weights ( 15*86 ) , which describe the contribution of each task contrast map to each extracted ICA component . The outer product of these weights with either the group-averaged contrast maps or the corresponding subject-specific contrast maps was used to obtain maps to drive subsequent dual regression analysis . Dual regression analysis ( driven by either group-averaged or subject-specific task basis maps after normalising the maximum of each subject and component map to 1 ) was run against subject resting state data to obtain timeseries and maps . CCA against behaviour was performed separately on the resulting network matrices and spatial maps as described above . Additionally , partial CCA was performed to determine the unique information contained in network matrices and in spatial maps . For this , any variance explained by network matrices was regressed out of the spatial maps and vice versa ( i . e . was \u2018partialled out\u2019 ) , before running the \u2018partial CCA\u2019 . Specifically , the 100 eigenvectors used as the input matrix to the CCA ( as explained above and following [Smith et al . , 2015] ) for partial network matrices were regressed out of the 100 eigenvectors for the spatial maps before running CCA , or conversely the 100 eigenvectors for spatial maps were regressed out of the 100 eigenvectors for the network matrices before running CCA .", "headings": ["Abstract", "Introduction", "Results", "Discussion", "Materials and methods"], "keywords": ["neuroscience"], "id": "elife-32992-v2"}
{"lay_summary": "The muscles that allow animal\u2019s to move are built predominantly of cells called myofibers . Like other specialized cell types , these myofibers develop via a regulated set of events called differentiation . In adults , this phenomenon occurs when muscles regenerate after an injury , and new myofibers differentiate from so-called satellite cells that already reside within the muscles . Differentiation is regulated at the genetic level , and the development of myofibers relies on the activation of muscle-specific genes . A gene\u2019s expression is typically controlled via a nearby regulatory region of DNA called a promoter that can be recognized by various molecular machines made from protein complexes . In most adult tissues , such regulatory machineries contain a complex called TFIID . Previously it was reported that the TFIID complex was eliminated from cells during muscle differentiation , and that an alternative protein complex called TBP2/TAF3 recognizes and regulates the promoters of muscle-specific genes . However , Malecova et al . have now discovered that TFIID is actually present , albeit at reduced amounts , in differentiated muscles and that it drives the activation of muscle-specific genes during differentiation . Further experiments also showed that the TBP2 protein is not required for differentiation of muscle cells or for the regeneration of injured muscles , and is actually absent in muscle cells . Further studies are now needed to explore how the TFIID-containing complex works with other regulatory protein complexes that are known to help make muscle-specific genes accessible to TFIID . It will also be important to study the relationship between the down-regulation of TFIID components and the activation of muscle-specific genes that typically occurs in mature myofbers . Together these efforts will allow the various aspects of gene regulation to be integrated , which will help provide a more complete understanding of the process of muscle differentiation .", "article": "Change in the identity of the components of the transcription pre-initiation complex is proposed to control cell type-specific gene expression . Replacement of the canonical TFIID-TBP complex with TRF3/TBP2 was reported to be required for activation of muscle-gene expression . The lack of a developmental phenotype in TBP2 null mice prompted further analysis to determine whether TBP2 deficiency can compromise adult myogenesis . We show here that TBP2 null mice have an intact regeneration potential upon injury and that TBP2 is not expressed in established C2C12 muscle cell or in primary mouse MuSCs . While TFIID subunits and TBP are downregulated during myoblast differentiation , reduced amounts of these proteins form a complex that is detectable on promoters of muscle genes and is essential for their expression . This evidence demonstrates that TBP2 does not replace TBP during muscle differentiation , as previously proposed , with limiting amounts of TFIID-TBP being required to promote muscle-specific gene expression . \n The process of RNA polymerase II ( RNAPII ) recruitment to protein coding genes is part of the assembly of the Pre-Initiation Complex ( PIC ) that is typically nucleated by TFIID-mediated recognition of core promoter sequences . The TFIID complex is composed of TATA-box binding protein ( TBP ) and TBP-associated factors ( TAFs ) ( Roeder , 1996; Tora , 2002 ) . Moreover , several TBP-related factors ( TRFs ) have been identified ( Akhtar and Veenstra , 2011 ) , expanding the repertoire and versatility of the basal transcription machinery ( M\u00fcller et al . , 2010; Goodrich and Tjian , 2010; M\u00fcller et al . , 2007 ) . While a number of events contribute to promote PIC assembly , including sequence-specific transcriptional activators , chromatin remodeling complexes and histone modifications , recent work has proposed that changes in the identity of PIC components is a key determinant of cell type-specific gene expression ( Hart et al . , 2007; Deato and Tjian , 2007 ) . In particular , it was recently suggested that during skeletal muscle differentiation , canonical TFIID is replaced by a complex consisting of TBP2 ( also termed TRF3 = TBP-related factor 3; gene name Tbpl2 = TATA box binding protein like 2 ) and TAF3 , which is required for activation of muscle genes ( Deato and Tjian , 2007; Deato et al . , 2008 ) . Further work has revealed that the alternative core factor TAF3 , which is known to recognize histone H3K4me3 - a histone modification associated with active promoters ( Vermeulen et al . , 2007; van Ingen et al . , 2008; Lauberth et al . , 2013; Stijf-Bultsma et al . , 2015 ) - mediates interactions between MyoD , permissive chromatin and PICs at promoters of muscle-specific genes ( Deato et al . , 2008; Yao et al . , 2011 ) . This finding suggested that the widely established paradigm of a universal and prevalent use of TFIID as a promoter-recognizing complex in a variety of somatic cells might undergo drastic change during development . Nevertheless this hypothesis has been challenged by the observation that TBP2 null ( TBP2_KO = TBP2 knock out ) mice do not display any skeletal muscle phenotype ( Gazdag et al . , 2009 ) , indicating that TBP2 is dispensable for developmental myogenesis ( see http://www . europhenome . org/databrowser/viewer . jsp ? set=true&m=true&x=Both Split&ln=Tbp2&project=All&zygosity=All&m=true&l=10386 ) . However , Gazdag et al . did not explore the integrity of the regeneration potential of skeletal muscles in TBP2 null mice during adult life , and thus have not ruled out the possibility that TBP2 can specifically promote the expression of muscle genes in muscle stem ( satellite ) cells ( MuSCs ) - the direct effectors of post-natal and adult skeletal myogenesis ( Chang and Rudnicki , 2014 ) . MuSCs are usually found beneath the basal lamina of unperturbed muscles in a dormant state ( quiescence ) ( Mauro , 1961 ) , but are rapidly activated upon damage to give rise to new , differentiated myofibers through extensive epigenetic reprogramming ( Dilworth and Blais , 2011; Sartorelli and Juan , 2011; Moresi et al . , 2015 ) . Two key molecular events that invariably coincide with MuSC activation and commitment toward myogenic differentiation are ( i ) the expression of skeletal muscle transcription master regulator MyoD ( Zammit et al . , 2004; Tapscott , 1988 ) and ( ii ) the activation of the p38 signaling ( Jones et al . , 2005 ) . These pathways cooperate to promote SWI/SNF-mediated chromatin remodeling and to increase levels of the active chromatin mark H3K4me3 ( Bernstein et al . , 2005 ) at promoters of muscle genes ( Simone , 2004; Rampalli et al . , 2007; Forcales et al . , 2012 ) . Indeed , studies from the Rando group have revealed that in activated MuSCs the large majority of muscle gene promoters show enrichment in H3K4me3 ( Liu et al . , 2013 ) . Collectively , the data described above suggest that the H3K4me3 chromatin mark can mediate TAF3 recruitment to MyoD-target genes in activated MuSCs . Since TAF3 has been proposed as a mediator of TBP2 recruitment to muscle gene promoters ( Deato et al . , 2008; Yao et al . , 2011 ) , these data provide the rationale for investigating whether TBP2 deficiency can impair post-natal and adult skeletal myogenesis . \n To investigate the role of TBP2 in postnatal and adult skeletal myogenesis in vivo we assessed the muscle regeneration potential of TBP2 null mice ( Gazdag et al . , 2009 ) in response to injury . Notexin-mediated muscle injury triggers extensive muscle damage and stimulates adult muscle regeneration and post-natal myogenesis in vivo , during which damaged muscle is replaced by newly formed myofibers arising from activated MuSCs . Histological assessment of regenerating muscles showed a complete recovery of the muscle architecture , with abundant presence of centrally nucleated fibers in both wild type ( WT ) and TBP2 null muscles at 12 days post injury - a time point when muscle regeneration is near completion ( Figure 1A ) . Both WT and TBP2 null mice contain similar numbers of Pax7 positive MuSCs in a sub-laminar position within unperturbed muscles ( Figure 1B upper panel , 1C ) . This result indicates that there are no defects in MuSC ontogenesis in the absence of Tbpl2 expression . Importantly , we detected comparable numbers of MuSCs in muscles of WT and TBP2 null mice 12 days after injury ( Figure 1B lower panel , 1C ) , indicating an intact capacity of adult MuSCs to proliferate , self-renew and differentiate during ongoing muscle regeneration in the absence of TBP2 . Finally , we used Fluorescence Assisted Cell Sorting ( FACS ) to isolate MuSCs from skeletal muscles of WT and TBP2 null mice before and 12 days after notexin-mediated injury , and analyzed their intrinsic myogenic potential ex vivo Cultures of MuSCs from all conditions yielded a comparable number of Myosin Heavy Chain ( MHC ) -positive multinucleated myotubes ( Figure 1D , E ) , demonstrating that MuSCs from TBP2 null muscles have the identical myogenic potential of MuSCs from WT mice as they can readily differentiate into myotubes with equal capacity upon exposure to differentiation conditions in vitro . 10 . 7554/eLife . 12534 . 003Figure 1 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 12534 . 003 Our in vivo data on adult muscle regeneration , as well as the intact differentiation potential of Tbpl2-lacking MuSCs ex vivo demonstrate that TBP2 is dispensable for adult skeletal muscle differentiation . Our data demonstrating the lack of requirement of TBP2 for adult skeletal muscle regeneration prompted us to compare the RNA expression profile of Tbp and Tbpl2 genes in MuSCs isolated from skeletal muscles of wild type mouse by FACS , and in the C2C12 myogenic cell line ( Blau et al . , 1983 ) . Tbp expression was detected in both MuSC-derived myotubes and in C2C12 myotubes ( Figure 2A ) . On the contrary , we could not detect Tbpl2 expression in myotubes derived from MuSCs or C2C12s ( Figure 2A ) . Ckm RNA expression in MuSCs and in C2C12 confirms that cells were differentiated into mytubes . As a control for Tbpl2 RNA detection , we analyzed total RNA extracted from murine ovary tissue ( Figure 2A ) , as previous work demonstrated the ovary-specific expression of TBP2 in mice ( Gazdag et al . , 2009 ) . Independent analysis of publicly available RNA-seq data from C2C12 myoblasts and myotubes ( Trapnell et al . , 2010 ) and of our RNA-seq data from MyoD-converted human fibroblasts , further confirmed the absence of Tbpl2 expression in skeletal myoblasts and myotubes ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 12534 . 004Figure 2 .

RNA-seq data comparing Tbp and Tbpl2 gene expression in murine C2C12 and in human fibroblasts IMR90 converted by ectopic expression of MyoD .

RNA-seq data were uploaded to UCSC genome browser for visual representation . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 12534 . 005 As a further control of accuracy for detection of Tbpl2 in muscle cells , we transfected C2C12 myoblasts with a murine Tbpl2-expressing plasmid and monitored the Tbpl2 and Tbp expression in differentiated C2C12 myotubes by immunoblot analysis of total cell lysates of C2C12 myotubes and by RT-PCR analysis of RNA isolated from C2C12 myotubes ( Figure 2B , C ) . We could detect the TBP2 protein ( Figure 2B ) and Tbpl2 transcript ( Figure 2C ) in C2C12 myotubes only upon ectopic expression of Tbpl2 . Importantly , the ectopic Tbpl2 expression in C2C12s did not affect the formation of myotubes and the expression levels of muscle differentiation genes , such as Myog and Ckm ( Figure 2C ) . The data we present here demonstrate that Tbpl2 is not expressed during differentiation of skeletal myoblasts into myotubes . Since TBP levels were reported to be significantly decreased during differentiation of skeletal myoblasts into myotubes ( Deato and Tjian , 2007; Zhou et al . , 2013; Li et al . , 2015 ) , while TBP2 is absent in differentiating myotubes ( data reported here ) , we tested whether lower amounts of TBP would be functional during muscle differentiation . We have effectively downregulated TBP protein levels in C2C12 myoblasts using an siRNA-mediated approach ( Figure 3A , C ) , and exposed them to differentiation conditions . While C2C12s transfected with control siRNA readily differentiated into large multinucleated myotubes within 48\u00a0hr ( Figure 3A , siCTR ) , C2C12 myoblasts with undetectable TBP protein levels failed to differentiate ( Figure 3A , siTBP ) . We have quantified the differentiation index , the percentage of nuclei within myotubes of differentiated C2C12 , to illustrate better the impaired differentiation potential of C2C12 in the absence of TBP ( Figure 3B ) . mRNA analysis of skeletal muscle specific genes Myog , Ckm and Acta1 demonstrates an impaired activation of the skeletal muscle program in the absence of TBP ( Figure 3D ) . Thus , although TBP levels are reduced in myotubes compared to myoblasts under physiological conditions ( Deato and Tjian , 2007 ) , near complete TBP elimination impairs muscle differentiation . We conclude that TBP is required for skeletal muscle differentiation . 10 . 7554/eLife . 12534 . 006Figure 3 . TBP is required for myoblast differentiation into myotubes .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 12534 . 006 The requirement of TBP for skeletal muscle differentiation and the absence of TBP2 in skeletal myotubes suggest that the TFIID complex may be present in myogenic cells and may drive muscle gene transcription during myoblast differentiation into myotubes . To test this hypothesis we have set out to detect expression of TAF subunits of the TFIID complex in both cultured C2C12 and MuSC myoblasts and myotubes at the RNA and protein levels . We observe a downregulation of mRNA expression of the TFIID subunits TBP and TAFs in myotubes derived from both C2C12s ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A ) and from MuSCs ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B ) , compared to undifferentiated cells ( myoblasts ) . Next , we further analyzed the protein levels of TFIID subunits in myoblasts and in myotubes by immunoblot analysis ( Figure 4A ) . Indeed , TFIID subunits were detected in C2C12 nuclear extracts prepared from both proliferating myoblasts and differentiated myotubes , with a concomitant downregulation of most TFIID subunits also at the protein level ( Figure 4A ) , as previously observed ( Deato and Tjian , 2007; Zhou et al . , 2013 ) . To demonstrate the purity of the myoblasts and myotubes isolated in our experimental conditions , we monitored the protein expression of the cell cycle protein Cyclin D1 , which is typically expressed in myoblasts and downregulated during muscle differentiation ( Figure 4A ) . We also analyzed markers of myogenic differentiation , such as Myogenin , Myosin Heavy Chain ( MHC ) and Actinin 3 , ( Figure 4A ) . Expression of these proteins is specific for either myoblasts ( Cyclin D1 ) or myotubes ( Myogenin , MHC , Actinin 3 ) , and demonstrates the high purity of the cell populations used in our study , confirming that detection of TFIID subunits in myotubes is not due to contamination with undifferentiated myoblasts . 10 . 7554/eLife . 12534 . 007Figure 4 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 12534 . 008 Next we analyzed the physical association between TBP and TAFs , as well as the integrity of the TFIID complex in C2C12 myoblasts and myotubes . Immunoprecipitation of endogenous TBP from nuclear extract prepared from C2C12 myoblasts and myotubes demonstrated an association of mTBP with mTAF4 and mTAF6 core subunits of TFIID in both proliferating and differentiated C2C12s ( Figure 4B ) , further demonstrating the presence of the TFIID complex in myoblasts as well as in myotubes . Size fractionation of nuclear extracts from C2C12 myoblasts or myotubes by glycerol gradient centrifugation revealed the presence of TFIID subunits TBP , TAF4 and TAF6 in a high molecular weight fraction of about 0 . 6\u20131 MDa , thus detecting the TFIID complex in both myoblasts and myotubes ( Figure 4C ) , at the same size previously described in human HeLa cells ( Dem\u00e9ny , 2007 ) . Altogether , our results are contrary to previously reported data ( Deato and Tjian , 2007 ) and demonstrate that the TFIID complex is not replaced by TBP2 upon myogenic differentiation . The requirement of TBP for skeletal muscle differentiation prompted us to further analyze the dynamics of the PIC assembly on muscle promoters during C2C12 myoblast-to-myotube differentiation . Upon exposure of myoblasts to differentiation cues , we detected recruitment of TBP and RNA polymerase II phosphorylated on Serine 5 of its carboxy-terminal domain CTD ( RNAPII-S5P ) , the transcription initiating form of RNAPII ( Hengartner et al . , 1998; Komarnitsky et al . , 2000 ) , on muscle gene promoters regulated by MyoD ( Figure 5 ) . TBP and RNAPII-S5P were not detected on these promoters in proliferating myoblasts , when the muscle genes are inactive ( Figure 5 ) , further supporting the evidence that TBP drives MyoD-mediated activation of muscle-specific gene transcription during muscle differentiation . TBP and RNAPII-S5P were present on the constitutively active Gapdh promoter in myoblasts and myotubes , but not on transcriptionally silent loci such as the Sox2 promoter and the Igh enhancer ( Figure 5 ) . Thus , our data demonstrate the direct involvement of TBP in nucleating PIC assembly at MyoD-regulated skeletal muscle promoters during muscle differentiation . 10 . 7554/eLife . 12534 . 009Figure 5 . TBP is recruited to muscle genes upon muscle differentiation . Chromatin Immunoprecipitation ( ChIP ) assay in proliferating C2C12 myoblasts and differentiated C2C12 myotubes monitors recruitment of TBP and RNAPII-S5P components of PIC at promoters of skeletal muscle genes Myog , Acta1 , Ttn , Pdlim3 , Mylpf and Mybph . Transcriptionally active Gapdh promoter and inactive Sox2 promoter and Igh enhancer were used as controls . Signal of relative recruitment is represented as a percentage of input DNA . Representative experiment of two independent biological replicate experiments is shown . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 12534 . 009 \n In this work , we demonstrate that TBP , but not TBP2 , is the essential component of the PIC that promotes muscle gene expression in differentiated skeletal muscles . We found that TBP2 is not expressed in myotubes derived from either C2C12 myoblasts , nor from primary mouse MuSCs . Consistently , TBP2-deficient mice displayed an intact regeneration potential , and MuSCs isolated from TBP2-deficient muscles differentiated into myotubes with the same efficiency as wild type MuSCs . This evidence firmly supports the conclusion that TBP2 does not replace TBP during muscle differentiation , as previously proposed by Deato et al . ( Deato and Tjian , 2007 ) . We have observed downregulation of TFIID subunits at both the RNA and protein levels in differentiated myotubes , compared to proliferating myoblasts , as has previously been reported ( Deato and Tjian , 2007; Zhou et al . , 2013 ) . Recently , a mechanism for ubiquitination-mediated downregulation of TBP protein in skeletal myotubes was reported ( Li et al . , 2015 ) . Therefore , the plausible scenario in skeletal muscle specific transcription is that limited TFIID helps to restrict the assembly of the transcription competent PIC at a selected subset of muscle specific genes . Our findings that TBP/TFIID is functional in muscle progenitors and their differentiated progeny are in agreement with earlier studies showing that TBP was able to bind the MyoD promoter in a TATA-dependent manner ( Leibham et al . , 1994 ) . It has been also shown that MyoD efficiently stimulated TFIID-dependent basal transcription ( Heller and Bengal , 1998; Dilworth , 2004 ) . Moreover , an endogenous interaction between MyoD and TBP in both myoblasts and myotubes was demonstrated , and in myotubes , MyoD and components of PIC TBP and TFIIB were found to be recruited to the proximal promoter of the alpha-sarcoglycan muscle gene promoter ( Delgado-Olgu\u00edn et al . , 2006 ) . The relevance of TBP-mediated activation of MyoD target genes has been recently emphasized by the finding that large polyglutamine ( PolyQ ) repeats in TBP causes muscle degeneration , by reducing the expression of muscle-specific genes , due to a decreased association of TBP with MyoD ( Huang et al . , 2015 ) .

C57/BL6 TBP2_KO ( TBP2 null; TBP2-/- ) mice were described previously ( Gazdag et al . , 2009 ) . The mouse colony was maintained by breeding heterozygous females TBP2+/- with heterozygous males TBP2+/- . Acute injury and muscle regeneration were induced in TBP2 null mice or in the wild type ( WT ) littermates by intramuscular injection of 10 \u00b5l of 10\u00a0\u03bcg/ml notexin ( NTX , Latoxan , Valence , France ) into the tibialis anterior ( TA ) , gastrocnemius and quadriceps muscles . Mice were sacrificed 12 days post injury . Muscles were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen-cooled isopentane and cut transversally using a Leica CM 3050 S cryostat . Muscle regeneration was evaluated histologically on 10 \u00b5m cryo-sections of muscles . For Hematoxylin and Eosin staining ( H&E , HT110-3 , Sigma , St . Luis , MO ) , 10 \u00b5m muscle cryo-sections were stained in hematoxylin for 3 min and eosin Y for 2 min , according to the instructions . Stained cryosections were dried in ethanol and fixed in xylene , and slides were mounted with EUKITT mounting ( O . Kindler GmbH & CO , Freiburg , Germany ) . Images were acquired using an inverted epifluorescent microscope ( Nikon TE300 , Tallahasee , FL ) , 10x objective lens . All images were processed using ImageJ . For Pax7 immunofluorescence experiments , 10 \u00b5m muscle cryosections were fixed in 1 . 5% paraformaldehyde for 15 min and permeabilized with 0 . 3% Triton-X . To avoid non-specific binding , muscle sections were blocked with 20% goat serum ( Gibco by Thermo Fisher Scientific , Waltham ) in PBS . Immunolabeling with a rat anti-Laminin B2 ( 05\u2013206 , Millipore , Billerica , MA , USA ) antibody was performed overnight at 4\u00b0C , followed by labeling with secondary anti-rat antibody coupled with Alexa Fluor 488 ( Molecular Probes , Thermo Fisher Scientific , Waltham , MA , USA ) . Next , the antigen retrieval was performed using the Antigen Unmasking Reagent ( Vector Laboratories , Burlingame , CA , USA ) at 100\u00b0C for 15\u2009min . Specimens were next labeled with mouse anti-Pax7 antibody ( PAX7 , Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank , Iowa City , IA , USA ) in 20% goat serum and 0 . 3% Triton-X in PBS overnight at 4\u00b0C , followed by labeling with a secondary anti-mouse antibody coupled with Alexa Fluor 546 ( Molecular Probes ) . Nuclei were visualized by counterstaining with DAPI ( Molecular Probes , Thermo Fisher Scientific , Waltham , MA , USA ) . Images were captured using a Zeiss LSM 710 Multiphoton microscope equipped with Zen Software ( Zeiss , Pleasanton , CA , USA ) and subsequently edited in ImageJ . Satellite cells were isolated from hind limb muscles of WT and TBP null mice , either unperturbed or 12 days post acute injury by fluorescence-activated cell sorting ( FACS ) , as previously described ( Sacco et al . , 2008 ) . Hind limb muscles were mechanically minced and enzymatically digested in HBSS\u00a0with\u00a0Mg2+\u00a0and\u00a0Ca2+ ( Gibco by Thermo Fisher Scientific , Waltham , MA , USA ) containing 0 . 2% ( w/v ) BSA and 10 Units/ml Penicillin + 10 \u00b5g/ml Streptomycin ( Gibco by Thermo Fisher Scientific , Waltham , MA , USA ) , 2 mg/ml Collagenase A ( Roche , Mannheim , Germany ) , 2 . 4 U/ml Dispase I ( Roche , Mannheim , Germany ) , 10 \u00b5g/ml DNase I ( Roche , Mannheim , Germany ) , 0 . 4 mM CaCl2 and 5 mM MgCl2 and 0 . 2% ( w/v ) Bovine Serum Albumin ( BSA ) for 90\u2009min at 37\u00b0C . The cell suspension was filtered through a 100 \u00b5m nylon cell strainer ( BD Falcon , Tamaulipas , Mexico ) , followed by filtration through 40 \u00b5m nylon cell strainer ( BD Falcon ) . Cells were labeled with primary antibodies: CD31-PacificBlue ( RM5228 , Life Technologies by Thermo Fisher Scientific , Waltham , MA , USA ) , CD45-eFluor450 ( clone 30-F11 , eBioscience , San Diego , CA , USA ) , Ter119-eFluor450 ( clone TER-119 , eBioscience ) , Sca-1-FITC ( clone E13-161 . 7 , BD Pharmingen , by BD Biosciences , San Josa , CA , USA ) , CD34-APC ( clone RAM34 , BD Pharmingen ) and \u03b17integrin-PE ( clone R2F2 , AbLab , Vancouver , Canada ) for 30\u2009min at 4\u00b0C , in a HBSS buffer with\u00a0Mg2+\u00a0and\u00a0Ca2+\u00a0containing 0 . 2% ( w/v ) BSA and 10 Units/ml Penicillin + 10 \u00b5g/ml Streptomycin . Cells were washed and resuspended in HBSS\u00a0with\u00a0Mg2+\u00a0and\u00a0Ca2+ containing 0 . 2% ( w/v ) BSA and Penicillin /Streptomycin . Dead cells were stained with Propidium Iodide ( PI ) ( Sigma , St . Luis , MO , USA ) . Live PI-negative satellite cells were isolated as Ter119-/CD45-/CD31-/CD34+/\u03b17-integrin+/Sca-1- cells . Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting ( FACS ) was performed at the Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute Flow Cytometry Core using a FACSAria instrument , and the data were analyzed by FACSDiva 6 . 1 . 3 software . FACS isolated satellite cells were plated in laminin-coated tissue culture plates , in culture media containing 50% F10 media ( Gibco by Thermo Fisher Scientific , Waltham , MA , USA ) , 50% DMEM media with low glucose ( Gibco by Thermo Fisher Scientific , Waltham , MA , USA ) , containing 15% Fetal Bovine Serum ( HyClone , Logan , UT , USA ) , 2 . 5 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor ( bFGF , PrepoTech Inc . Rocky Hill , NJ , USA ) , and 10 Units/ml Penicillin + 10 \u00b5g/ml Streptomycin . After five days of culture , satellite cells were shifted to differentiation media containing DMEM High glucose ( HyClone , Logan , UT , USA ) , 2% Horse serum ( Gibco by Thermo Fisher Scientific , Waltham , MA , USA ) and ITS liquid media supplement ( Sigma , St . Luis , MO , USA ) for an additional 3 days . Culture media was refreshed every two days . Cultured differentiated Satellite cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min and permeabilized with 0 . 25% Triton-X in PBS for 10\u2009min at room temperature . To avoid non-specific binding , cells were blocked with 20% goat serum in PBS for 30\u2009min . Immunolabeling with anti-Myosin Heavy Chain ( MHC ) primary antibody ( clone MF20 , Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank ) in 5% goat serum overnight at 4\u00b0C . Secondary anti-mouse antibody coupled to Alexa Fluor 488 ( Molecular Probes ) was used to detect MHC signal in myotubes . Nuclei were counterstained with Hoechst 33258 ( Life Technologies by Thermo Fisher Scientific , Waltham , MA , USA ) . Images were taken with Olympus fluorescent microscope with 10x magnification . C2C12 myoblasts were obtained from ATCC ( Manassas , VA , USA ) and cultured in DMEM High glucose media ( growth media = GM ) containing 15% Fetal Bovine Serum at low confluency . For differentiation , C2C12 cells were grown to 90% confluence and shifted to differentiation medium ( DM ) DMEM high glucose containing 2% horse serum and ITS Liquid Media Supplement for two days . Proliferating myoblasts were collected by scraping , while differentiated myotubes were collected by careful trypsinization with 0 . 05% Trypsin-EDTA ( Gibco by Thermo Fisher Scientific , Waltham , MA , USA ) to avoid contamination of myotubes by reserve cells ( Kitzmann et al . , 1998 ) . After collection , C2C12 cells were washed with cold PBS containing 1 mM PMSF ( Sigma , St . Luis , MO , USA ) . Collected C2C12 cells were frozen and stored at -80\u00b0C . C2C12 myoblasts were transfected with a pSG5-mTBP2 expressing plasmid ( Gazdag et al . , 2007 ) or a control empty plasmid using Fugene HD transfection reagent ( Promega , Madison , WI , USA ) according to manufacturer's recommendation . Two days post-transfection , when C2C12 myoblasts were 90% confluent , cells were shifted to a differentiation medium ( DM ) DMEM high glucose containing 2% horse serum and ITS Liquid Media Supplement for two days . Differentiated myotubes were collected for RNA and protein analysis by careful trypsinization ( Kitzmann et al . , 1998 ) as described above . C2C12 cells were transfected by forward transfection with 80 nM siRNA against TBP gene ( siTBP , On Target plus Smart Pool L-041188-01 , Dharmacon by Thermo Fisher Scientific , Waltham , MA , USA ) or non-targeting siRNA ( siCTR , D-002050-01-20 , Dharmacon ) using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX ( Life Technologies by Thermo Fisher Scientific , Waltham , MA , USA ) according the manufacturer's instructions . Two days post transfection , 90% confluent cells were shifted to differentiation media ( DM ) containing 2% horse serum with ITS supplement . Cells were collected after two days of differentiation in DM for further analysis by immunoblot and for RNA analysis . RNA from C2C12 cells was extracted using RNeasy kit ( Qiagen , Hilden , Germany ) and the RNA from satellite cells ( MuSCs ) was extracted using miRNeasy Micro kit ( Qiagen ) following the manufacturer\u2019s protocol . cDNA was synthetized using QuantiTect Reverse Transcription kit ( Qiagen ) and analyzed by real-time quantitative PCR using SYBR Green PCR Master Mix ( Applied Biosystems by Thermo Fisher Scientific , Waltham , MA , USA ) . Relative expression was calculated using 2-\u2206ct method ( Livak and Schmittgen , 2001 ) . Primers used to detect gene-specific\u00a0cDNA\u00a0are listed in Table 1 . C2C12 cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS ( Santa Cruz , Dallas , TX , USA ) for 15 min and permeabilized with 0 . 5% Triton-X in PBS for 15\u2009min at room temperature . To avoid non-specific binding , cells were blocked with 5% BSA in PBS for 30\u2009min . Immunolabeling with anti-Myosin Heavy Chain ( MHC ) primary antibody ( clone MF20 , Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank ) in 5% BSA was done overnight at 4\u00b0C . Secondary anti-mouse antibody coupled to Alexa Fluor 555 ( Molecular Probes ) was used to detect MHC signal in myotubes . Nuclei were counterstained with Hoechst 33258 ( Life Technologies by Thermo Fisher Scientific , Waltham , MA , USA ) . Images were taken with Olympus fluorescent microscope with 20x magnification . Human lung fibroblasts IMR90 ( ATCC , Manassas , VA , USA ) transfected with doxycycline inducible mouse MyoD were cultured in growth media ( GM , DMEM high glucose containing 10% FBS ) . For the GM time point ( proliferating converted myoblasts ) MyoD expression was induced with 200 ng/ml of doxycycline ( Sigma , St . Luis , MO , USA ) 24\u2009hr prior to the collection of cells . For the DM time point ( differentiated myotubes ) , MyoD-expressing IMR90 cells were differentiated into myotubes for 72\u201396\u2009hr in differentiation media ( DM , DMEM high glucose containing 2% horse\u00a0serum and ITS supplement ) . RNA was extracted using trizol ( Ambion by Thermo Fisher Scientific , Waltham , MA , USA ) following manufacturer\u2019s instructions . PolyA mRNA library preparation was performed as previously described ( Jin et al . , 2013 ) and sequenced on the Hi-Seq2000 platform . Reads were mapped to reference human genome ( hg19 ) using TOPHAT\u00a0v1 . 4 . 0 ( http://tophat . cbcb . umd . edu/ ) . Cells were lysed in RIPA lysis buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8 . 0 , 150 mM NaCl , 5 mM EDTA pH 8 . 0 , 0 . 5% SDS , 1% NP40 , 0 . 5% Sodium Deoxycholate , 1 mM PMSF and protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail ( Roche , Mannheim , Germany ) . Cell lysate was syringed through 29G1/2 needle\u00a0ten times on ice and diluted five fold with TBS ( 50 mM TRIS-Cl pH 7 . 5 , 150 mM NaCl ) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail ( Roche ) . Cell lysates were spun at 14 , 000\u00a0g for 10\u2009min at 4\u00b0C and supernatant was saved as soluble protein extract . Protein concentration of soluble cell lysates was determined by BCA assay ( Pierce\u00a0by Thermo FIsher Scientific , Waltham , MA , USA ) . Nuclear extracts from C2C12 myoblasts and C2C12 myotubes carefully trypsinized ( Kitzmann et al . , 1998 ) were prepared as described previously ( Dignam , 1983 ) . For NE preparation , C2C12 cells were thawed on ice and rinsed in 10 ml hypotonic buffer ( 50 mM Tris-Cl pH 8 . 0 , 5 mM EDTA pH 8 . 0 , 20% glycerol ) . Next nuclei were gently resuspended in Low Salt buffer ( 10 mM KCl , 20 mM Tris-HCl , pH 7 . 2 , 0 . 2 mM EDTA , 1 . 5 mM MgCl2 , 10 mM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol , 20% glycerol ) .

Protein concentration was measured using a BCA assay ( Pierce ) . Before immunopreipitation , 250 \u00b5l ( 200 \u00b5g proteins ) of nuclear extracts were precleared with 50 \u00b5l protein G-coated magnetic beads ( Life Technologies by Thermo Fisher Scientific , Waltham , MA , USA ) for 1\u00a0hr at 4\u00b0C . After pre-clearing , nuclear extracts were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with 10 \u00b5g of anti-TBP antibody ( 3TF1-3G3 , mouse monoclonal ) ( Brou et al . , 1993 ) or with 10 \u00b5g of non-specific mouse IgG ( sc-2025 , Santa Cruz , Dallas , TX , USA ) cross-linked to protein G-coated magnetic beads using dimethyl pimelimidate , in the presence of 125 Units Benzonase ( Novagen by Merck Millipore , Billerica , MA , USA ) . Protein G-bound immunocomplexes were washed seven times with BC buffer containing 150 mM KCl , and once with BC buffer containing 300 mM KCl . Isolated immunocomplexes were eluted from beads by incubation of samples with 60 \u00b5l of 1 mg/ml TBP peptide ( PA81 , synthetized by GenScript , Piscataway Township , NJ , USA ) in BC buffer containing 150 mM KCl for 3\u00a0hr on ice . 3 . 6 ml of 10\u201355% glycerol gradient was prepared by sequential layering of ten aliquots of 360 \u00b5l of BC buffer ( 150 mM KCl , 20 mM Tris-HCl , pH 7 . 2 , 0 . 2 mM EDTA , 1 . 5 mM MgCl2 , 10 mM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol , 20% glycerol , 0 . 5 mM PMSF ) containing and 55 , 50 , 45 , 40 , 35 , 30 , 25 , 20 , 15 and 10% glycerol . Nuclear extract was dialyzed against BC buffer containing 150 mM KCl and 8% glycerol at 4\u00b0C for 3\u00a0hr and spun down at 14 , 000\u2009g for 15\u2009min . 500 \u00b5g of dialyzed C2C12 nuclear extract was loaded onto 3 . 6 ml of 10\u201355% glycerol gradient , and size fractionated by centrifugation at 45 , 000 rpm for 16\u00a0hr in SW55Ti rotor ( Beckman Coulter , Carlsbad , CA , USA ) at 4\u00b0C . 19 glycerol gradient fractions of volume 200 \u00b5l were collected and analyzed by immunoblot analysis .

Fractions containing Mw standard were analyzed by 4\u201312% Tris-Glycine-SDS PAGE ( Life Technologies by Thermo Fisher Scientific , Waltham , MA , USA ) followed by Coomassie staining of the gels ( Bio-Safe Coomassie G-250 stain , Biorad ) . Proteins of either nuclear extract or total cell lysate were size separated on 4\u201312% gradient Tris-Glycine-SDS denaturing PAGE ( Life Technologies ) and transferred onto a 0 . 45 \u00b5m nitrocellulose blotting membrane ( Protran Amersham , by GE Healthcare , Little Chalfont , United Kingdom ) . The membrane was blocked with 5% milk in TBST ( 50 mM Tris_HCl pH 7 . 5 , 150 mM NaCl , 0 . 1% Tween 20 ) buffer for 1\u00a0hr and subsequently probed with indicated antibodies in 5% milk in TBST\u00a0buffer . Immunoblot membranes were washed with TBST and probed with goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase HRP ( Biorad , Irvine , CA , USA ) . The signal was revealed using ECL Western Blotting Substrate ( Pierce by Thermo FIsher Scientific , Waltham , MA , USA ) . Antibodies used for immunoblot probing were as follows: anti-TBP ( 3TF1-3G3 , mouse monoclonal ) ( Brou et al . , 1993 ) , anti-TAF1 ( sc-17134 , Santa Cruz ) , anti-TAF2 ( 3038 , rabbit polyclonal ) ( Trowitzsch et al . , 2015 ) , anti-TAF4 ( 32TA-2B9 , mouse monoclonal ) ( Wieczorek et al . , 1998 ) , anti-TAF6 ( 25TA-2G7 , mouse monoclonal ) ( Wieczorek et al . , 1998 ) , anti-TAF10 ( 6TA-2B11 , mouse monoclonal ) ( Wieczorek et al . , 1998 ) , anti-TAF12 ( 22TA-2A1 , mouse monoclonal ) ( Wieczorek et al . , 1998 ) , anti-TBP2 ( 2TBP-2B12 , mouse monoclonal ) ( Gazdag et al . , 2007 ) , anti-Actinin 3 ( EP2531Y , Origene , Rockville , MD , USA ) , anti-Cyclin D1 ( EP272Y , EMD Millipore ) , anti-Myogenin ( clone F5D , Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank ) , anti-Tubulin ( clone DM1A , Sigma ) , anti-Actin ( sc-8432 , Santa Cruz ) , anti-Myosin Heavy Chain ( MHC , clone MF20 , Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank ) . C2C12 myoblasts and myotubes were collected by careful trypsinization ( Kitzmann et al . , 1998 ) and crosslinked in suspension in 40 ml PBS containing 1% formaldehyde for 15\u2009min at room temperature . Formaldehyde was quenched by 0 . 125 mM glycine for 5\u2009min at room temperature . Crosslinked cells were washed with cold PBS containing 1\u00a0mM PMSF . To prepare chromatin , cells were lysed in a ChIP lysis buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8 . 0 , 150 mM NaCl , 5\u00a0mM EDTA pH 8 . 0 , 0 . 2% SDS , 1% NP40 , 0 . 5% Sodium Deoxycholate , 1 mM PMSF and protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail ( Roche ) . Chromatin was sheared to an average DNA fragment length of 500bp using a Misonix3000 sonicator , and diluted five times with the ChIP lysis buffer lacking SDS , to the final concentration of 0 . 04% SDS . Samples were centrifuged and the protein concentration of soluble chromatin was determined by BCA assay ( Pierce ) . 200 \u00b5g of chromatin was used for immunoprecipitation with 10 \u00b5l anti-TBP antibody ( 3TF1-3G3 mouse monoclonal ) ( Brou et al . , 1993 ) or 8 \u00b5l anti-RNAPII-S5P antibody ( Active Motif , 39233 , Carlsbad , CA , USA ) . Sample with no antibody was used as a background control . After overnight incubation of the chromatin with the antibodies at 4\u00b0C , the immunocomplexes were captured with 50 \u00b5l protein A ( for RNAPII-S5P antibody ) or with 50 \u00b5l protein G ( for TBP antibody ) magnetic beads ( Life Technologies ) for further 3\u00a0hr at 4\u00b0C . Magnetic bead-bound immunocomplexes were washed four times with 1 ml buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8 . 0 , 150 mM NaCl , 5 mM EDTA pH 8 . 0 , 0 . 1% SDS , 1% NP-40 , 0 . 5% Sodium Deoxycholate , 1 mM PMSF , and protease and phosphatase inhibitors cocktail ( Roche ) , followed by one wash with a 1 ml buffer containing 250 mM LiCl , 100 mM NaCl , 5 mM EDTA pH 8 . 0 , 1% NP40 , 1% Sodium Deoxycholate , and a subsequent final two washes with 1 ml TE buffer . Immunocomplexes were eluted from the beads for 15\u2009min at 65\u00b0C with buffer containing 50 mM Tris-Cl pH 8 . 0 , 1\u00a0mM EDTA pH 8 . 0 and 1% SDS . Crosslinking was reversed by incubation of the ChIP isolated immunocomplexes and the input chromatin samples at 65\u00b0C overnight in presence of 0 . 2 M NaCl . After 0 . 2 mg/ml Proteinase K treatment of samples , DNA from immunoprecipitated samples as well as DNA from 1% input was purified by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation . 1/50 of the purified DNA was analyzed by real-time quantitative PCR using SYBR Green PCR Master Mix ( Applied Biosystems ) . Primers used to detect locus-specific signal are listed in Table 1 . The ChIP signal is\u00a0expressed\u00a0as the amount of immunoprecipitated DNA relative to the input DNA ( % of input ) .", "headings": ["Abstract", "Introduction", "Results", "Discussion", "Materials and methods"], "keywords": ["chromosomes and gene expression", "cell biology"], "id": "elife-12534-v2"}
{"lay_summary": "From riding a bike to reaching for a cup of coffee , all skilled actions rely on precise connections between the sensory and motor areas of the brain . While sensory areas receive and analyse input from the senses , motor areas plan and trigger muscle contractions . Precisely adjusting the connections between these and other areas enables us to learn new skills , and it also helps us to relearn skills lost as a result of brain injury or stroke . About 70 years ago , a psychologist named Donald Hebb came up with an idea for how this process might occur . He proposed that whenever two neurons are active at the same time , the connection between them becomes stronger . This idea , that \u2018cells that fire together , wire together\u2019 , became known as Hebb\u2019s rule . Many studies have since shown that Hebb\u2019s rule can explain changes in the strength of connections between pairs of neurons . But can it also explain how connections between entire brain regions become stronger or weaker ? New results show that it can . The data were obtained using a technique called optogenetics , in which viruses are used to introduce genes for light-sensitive proteins into neurons . Shining light onto the brain will then activate any cells within that area that contain the resulting proteins . Yazdan-Shahmorad , Silversmith et al . used this technique to activate small regions of either sensory or motor brain tissue in live macaque monkeys . Doing so strengthened the overall connectivity between the two areas . The effects were more variable at the level of smaller brain regions , with some connections becoming weaker rather than stronger . However , Yazdan-Shahmorad , Silversmith et al . show that Hebb\u2019s rule explains most of the observed changes . Many neurological and psychiatric disorders stem from abnormal brain connectivity . Simple forms of brain stimulation are already used to treat certain neurological disorders , such as Parkinson\u2019s disease . Stimulating the brain to induce specific changes in connectivity may ultimately enable us to leverage the brain\u2019s natural learning mechanisms to cure , instead of just treat , these conditions .", "article": "Brain stimulation modulates the excitability of neural circuits and drives neuroplasticity . While the local effects of stimulation have been an active area of investigation , the effects on large-scale networks remain largely unexplored . We studied stimulation-induced changes in network dynamics in two macaques . A large-scale optogenetic interface enabled simultaneous stimulation of excitatory neurons and electrocorticographic recording across primary somatosensory ( S1 ) and motor ( M1 ) cortex ( Yazdan-Shahmorad et al . , 2016 ) . We tracked two measures of network connectivity , the network response to focal stimulation and the baseline coherence between pairs of electrodes; these were strongly correlated before stimulation . Within minutes , stimulation in S1 or M1 significantly strengthened the gross functional connectivity between these areas . At a finer scale , stimulation led to heterogeneous connectivity changes across the network . These changes reflected the correlations introduced by stimulation-evoked activity , consistent with Hebbian plasticity models . This work extends Hebbian plasticity models to large-scale circuits , with significant implications for stimulation-based neurorehabilitation . \n Many neurological and psychiatric disorders arise from dysfunctional neural dynamics at the network level , which in turn stem from aberrant neural connectivity ( Stam , 2014; Wu et al . , 2016; Edwardson et al . , 2013; Yahata et al . , 2016; DeSalvo et al . , 2014; Skudlarski et al . , 2010 ) . The brain shows marked plasticity across a variety of learning and memory tasks ( Takeuchi et al . , 2014; Bliss et al . , 2014 ) and during recovery after brain injury or stroke ( Edwardson et al . , 2013; Hara , 2015; Murphy and Corbett , 2009 ) , and many have proposed to take advantage of this innate plasticity to treat neural disorders ( Miller et al . , 2010; Jackson et al . , 2006; Lucas and Fetz , 2013; Edwardson et al . , 2013 ) . In principle , brain stimulation protocols can be designed to leverage this plasticity in order to rewire aberrant neural connectivity , potentially curing these disorders . Implementing such treatments requires a better understanding of how stimulation-induced plasticity drives changes in network connectivity and network dynamics . The simple Hebbian model of plasticity ( Donald , 1949 ) and spike-timing dependent versions of it ( Bi and Poo , 2001 ) explain a large body of data on activity-dependent plasticity , including both in vitro ( Massobrio et al . , 2015; Abrahamsson et al . , 2016 ) , and in vivo ( Andersen et al . , 2017; Feldman , 2012; Shulz and Jacob , 2010 ) studies . Despite the extensive work studying Hebbian plasticity at the cellular level , it remains unclear how synaptic plasticity leads to large-scale functional reorganization . Recently , several studies have shown large-scale plasticity following brain stimulation that is consistent with Hebbian mechanisms ( Jackson et al . , 2006; Lucas and Fetz , 2013; Seeman et al . , 2017; Nishimura et al . , 2013; Rebesco and Miller , 2011; Rebesco et al . , 2010; Song et al . , 2013; Lajoie et al . , 2017 ) . In particular , Fetz and colleagues implemented an activity-dependent stimulation protocol , effectively introducing an artificial connection between two sites in the motor cortex ( Jackson et al . , 2006; Lucas and Fetz , 2013 ) . Continuous reinforcement of this artificial connection led to a stable functional change in stimulation-evoked movements , indicating that stimulation induces large-scale plasticity . Recently these results were reproduced in a modeling work at the network level ( Lajoie et al . , 2017 ) . Similar results have been observed using open-loop stimulation protocols to induce targeted plasticity between two cortical sites ( Rebesco and Miller , 2011; Seeman et al . , 2017 ) . Notably , these papers have reported off-target effects , but these were either interpreted as global changes in excitability or were not explained . Although the results from closed-loop and open-loop experiments suggest large-scale plasticity , the underlying neural network changes remain unexplored . Here , we measure connectivity across sensorimotor cortex and track changes in network connectivity in response to open-loop stimulation . This work takes advantage of a large-scale optogenetic interface ( Yazdan-Shahmorad et al . , 2016 ) that enables us to simultaneously stimulate populations of excitatory neurons while recording large-scale \u03bc-electrocorticography ( \u03bc-ECoG ) activity across two brain areas , S1 and M1 . We first establish and compare two measures of functional connectivity that provide complementary views of the mechanisms of plasticity . Next , we investigate how stimulation impacts connectivity between and within cortical areas . We then test whether stimulation-evoked activity drives large-scale network plasticity in a Hebbian manner . The goal of this work is to investigate large-scale functional reorganization following stimulation , which will inform future neurorehabilitation strategies . \n We quantified inter-area functional connectivity between S1 and M1 using two different measures\u2014one based on the network response to optogenetic stimulation and the other based on spontaneous neural activity . The first measure focused on how the response to optical stimulation propagates through the network . Optogenetic stimulation in S1 and M1 evoked responses across both cortical areas , and we characterized these responses according to their amplitudes and delays ( Figure 2A and E ) . The delays exhibited a bimodal distribution with a 3\u20136 ms separation between the early and late responses ( Figure 2B and F ) . Classifying the responses across electrodes by delay recovers the spatial separation between the two cortical areas\u2014following a boundary along the central sulcus\u2014with shorter delays in the area being stimulated ( S1 or M1; primary responses ) and longer delays in the other area ( M1 or S1; secondary responses ) ( Figure 2C and G ) . The short delay of the secondary responses suggests close functional connectivity between these areas . We quantified this connectivity with the stimulus-evoked response ratio ( SERR ) . SERR was defined as the peak-to-trough amplitude of the secondary responses ( A2 ) normalized by the peak-to-trough amplitude of the primary response ( A1 ) , with both responses measured in the high gamma ( 60\u2013200 Hz ) filtered signal ( see dashed-line inset boxes in Figure 2 , A and E ) . The SERR is a measure of the connectivity between the site of stimulation and sites in the other cortical area ( see Figure 2D and H ) . The second measure evaluates functional connectivity during spontaneous activity . We focused on the coherence in field potential recordings between electrodes , a widely used measure of connectivity that captures the degree of phase-locking between two signals ( Lang et al . , 2012; Bastos and Schoffelen , 2015 ) . We calculated the coherence between the site of stimulation and the secondary sites across different frequency bands . Because SERR and coherence are derived independently from recordings with and without simultaneous stimulation , they might reflect fundamentally different aspects of network connectivity . Therefore , in each experiment we compared these two measures prior to conditioning stimulation . Figure 3A shows two examples comparing SERR to coherence in the theta band ( 4\u20138 Hz ) . To quantify the relationship between these measures , we performed linear regression between them across channels ( Figure 3B\u2013C ) . An example showing a strong relationship between SERR and theta band coherence is shown in Figure 3B . This analysis was repeated for all coherence frequency bands and for all experiments; the mean and standard error of the regression parameters are shown in Figure 3C . The two measures of functional connectivity were highly correlated: across sessions , the distribution of regression slopes was significantly different from 0 ( t-test: p=3 . 73e-06 ) , and 69 percent of individual experiments showed significant linear regressions ( p<0 . 05 ) . This finding indicates that at baseline , before any conditioning , the stimulation-evoked response reflects network dynamics across the frequency spectrum . We used a simple stimulation protocol\u2014we delivered 5 ms laser light pulses at a frequency of 5 or 7 Hz at either one or two cortical sites ( Figure 4A ) . For our initial analyses , and unless otherwise noted , when stimulating at two cortical sites , we alternated stimulation between the two light sources to avoid any interference between the evoked responses from each light source . In each experiment , conditioning stimulation was applied for 50 min , and we evaluated functional connectivity every 10 min during blocks of passive baseline recording and active testing ( 100 light pulses delivered through each laser ) . We also conducted control sessions with the same passive recording and testing blocks , but with no stimulation during the conditioning blocks . A representative example experiment , shown in Figure 4B , shows that stimulation in M1 leads to significant increases ( paired t-test , p=3 . 88e\u221211 ) in mean SERR . Similar increases in SERR were observed for a majority of experiments ( 14 out of 18 experiments ) across both monkeys ( Figure 4C ) . The increases in connectivity were symmetric between the two cortical areas ( Figure 4D ) . No significant change in mean SERR was observed in control sessions without conditioning stimulation ( Figure 4D ) . Furthermore , the increase in SERR was significantly larger for stimulation sessions than control sessions ( unpaired t-test: p=0 . 0036 ) We next asked whether conditioning increased coherence-based measures of inter-area connectivity . We did observe increases in mean theta band ( 4\u20138 Hz ) coherence following conditioning , as shown in Figure 4E for the same dataset used in Figure 4B ( paired t-test , p=0 . 03 ) . The increase in theta coherence was significant for the majority of experiments ( 13 out of 20; Figure 4E ) , and the effect was localized to the theta band ( Figure 4G; paired t-test , p=0 . 017; Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons ) . We also looked for change in the theta-band power as a result of stimulation and did not see any significant changes , supporting the conclusion that changes in coherence reflect changes in functional connectivity ( See Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . We showed in Figure 3C above that SERR and coherence are correlated measures of functional connectivity in the baseline condition . Here we ask how this relationship is changed by stimulation . Figure 4H ( black lines ) replicates the baseline data from Figure 3C , along with new data showing the correlation between these measures at the end of each experiment ( green lines ) and between their conditioning-induced changes ( yellow lines ) . After conditioning , the cross-channel correlation between these measures significantly decreased ( paired t-test , p=6 . 3e-10 ) , and the changes in connectivity were uncorrelated ( t-test on distribution of regression slopes , p=0 . 85 ) . This suggests that the stimulation affects the two measures differently . To further address this , we replicated this analysis for our control ( no stimulation ) sessions . In this case , we did not see a significant decrease in the correlation between measures after control sessions ( paired t-test , p=0 . 36; see Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . Additionally , a direct comparison between the median decrease in the correlation for stimulation versus control sessions showed a significant difference when all frequencies were considered ( p=0 . 0025 ) , though the difference was not significant when only compared in the theta band . Together , these results show that the stimulation-induced changes in these two measures of connectivity do not correlate with each other at a fine-scale . This may reflect the fact that the two measures are not functionally equivalent , despite their correlation , i . e . , they capture related , but not identical , aspects of connectivity . As shown in Figure 1B , our stimulation protocol included 5 repetitions of baseline recording , testing , and conditioning . This design allowed us to track connectivity changes across time , after each 10 min increment of conditioning . Additionally , since neural activity was recorded throughout the experiment , we were able to measure changes in SERR during conditioning blocks . Figure 5A shows the evolution of mean inter-area connectivity for both measures in an example session . To account for differences in network connectivity across monkeys and sessions , we also analyzed the changes in each measure with respect to the baseline pre-conditioning measurements ( Figure 5B ) . For this example session ( Figure 5A ) , and on average across all sessions ( Figure 5B ) , there is a trend of increasing connectivity across the session that starts within the first 10 min conditioning block . These increases in inter-area connectivity measured with SERR and coherence ( Figure 5B ) were correlated across time ( Pearson correlation coefficient\u00a0=\u00a00 . 26 ) . Additionally , the rate of strengthening was consistent across conditioning blocks; we detected a significant increase in SERR ( p<0 . 05 ) at\u00a0~\u00a04 . 5 min of stimulation in 4 out of 5 conditioning blocks ( see Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1 for comparison with control sessions ) . Note that the stimulation-induced plasticity was not reinforced during baseline recording blocks . Given the length of the conditioning ( 10 min ) and baseline recording ( 5 min in most experiments ) blocks , one might expect that stimulation-induced changes would revert back to baseline . We did observe a significant decrease ( paired t-test , p=2 . 9e-05 ) in the SERR between the last 100 pulses of the conditioning block and the following test block , indicating some unlearning of the stimulation-induced connectivity changes . We next evaluated the fine-scale effects of conditioning across the entire network . Since SERR is restricted to connectivity from the stimulation site , this analysis was conducted using only changes in pairwise coherence . Figure 6A shows data from an example session , with connectivity changes represented as a set of heatmaps: the heatmap at each recording site represents the change in pairwise coherence between that electrode and all of the other electrodes . A magnified example heatmap is shown in Figure 6A , right; top panel . This example shows heterogeneous changes in connectivity across the network . We next asked whether such heterogeneous changes are to be expected . A Hebbian plasticity model suggests that the fine-scale changes in connectivity should reflect the statistics of plasticity-inducing activity . In this case , we predicted that correlated stimulation-evoked activity between two cortical sites would strengthen the functional connectivity between them , while uncorrelated or anti-correlated stimulation-evoked activity would weaken their functional connectivity . We quantified stimulation-induced correlations by measuring the pairwise coherence during the conditioning block and subtracting out the coherence calculated during baseline recording ( thought to be representative of initial connectivity ) . We refer to this difference as the stimulus-evoked coherence . Indeed , in the example session of Figure 6A , one can see a similarity between the pattern of changes in baseline coherence across the array ( left panel ) with the stimulus-evoked coherence ( middle panel ) . To quantify this similarity , we used linear regression to predict changes in baseline coherence across sites based on the stimulus-evoked coherence . Importantly , both of these quantities use the initial baseline coherence as a reference . So to avoid spurious correlations introduced by subtracting the same data from the two regression variables , we split the baseline recording blocks into two intervals and used the data from only one interval for each regressor ( See Materials and Methods for more details ) . Data from the example session in Figure 6A is shown as a scatter plot in Figure 6B , along with the calculated regression parameters . The plot shows a strong correlation between the stimulus-evoked coherence and changes in baseline coherence . This relationship was consistent across our data ( Figure 6C ) : the distribution of linear regression slopes across experimental sessions and monkeys was significant ( paired t-test: p=2 . 41e-19; 101 out of 105 experimental blocks had significant ( p<0 . 05 ) linear regression models ) . These results support a Hebbian model for network-wide changes in connectivity . To further test this model , we conducted some experimental sessions using a more complex spatio-temporal pattern of optical stimulation . Specifically , by reducing the latency between the two light sources to either 10 or 30 ms ( Figure 7A ) , we introduce interference between evoked responses from the two light sources ( Figure 7B ) . We repeated the analysis of mean inter-area coherence changes ( c . f . Figure 4F ) for these sessions , and we did not see a consistent increase in mean inter-area connectivity ( Figure 7C ) . Nevertheless , we found that stimulus-evoked coherence continued to predict changes in baseline coherence ( paired t-test on the distribution of regression slopes: p=1 . 37e-28; linear regression slopes with p<0 . 05: 160 out 170 blocks; Figure 7D , see Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1 for an example session ) . Furthermore , the regression parameters were similar to those obtained with the simple stimulation patterns ( Figure 6C ) , and both simple and complex stimulation experiments yielded regression slopes that were significantly larger than those obtained from control sessions ( long-latency vs . control sessions , ranksum test: p=0 . 048; short-latency vs . control sessions , ranksum test: p=0 . 037; see Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . These results demonstrate a robust relationship between stimulus-evoked correlations and changes in baseline connectivity across the network . These findings are well explained by a Hebbian model of large-scale stimulation-induced plasticity . \n Functional connectivity between M1 and S1 has been demonstrated in fMRI ( Matsui et al . , 2011; McGregor and Gribble , 2015 ) , electrophysiology ( Iriki et al . , 1989; Yazdan-Shahmorad et al . , 2016; Prsa et al . , 2017 ) , and anatomical studies ( Kosar et al . , 1985; Petrof et al . , 2015 ) . To evaluate stimulation-induced changes across these areas we investigated two measures of functional connectivity , one based on stimulation and one based on natural neural processing . Variants of SERR ( Seeman et al . , 2017; Feldmeyer and Sakmann , 2000; Klinshov et al . , 2014 ) and coherence ( Bastos and Schoffelen , 2015; Lang et al . , 2012 ) have been used previously to evaluate functional connectivity . However , to our knowledge they have never been used in combination or compared . In principle , these two measures reflect different aspects of functional connectivity . SERR is a more direct measure of the projections from the stimulation site . Importantly , stimulation likely evokes activity from both terminals and cell bodies located at the stimulation site , though C1V1 does not express well down at the axon ( Rajasethupathy et al . , 2015 ) . Secondary responses arise from a combination of synaptic , antridromic , and indirect ( network ) effects . That said , based on the timing of the evoked responses and the limited expression of C1V1 in axon terminals , we expect the amplitude of secondary responses normalized to primary response amplitudes to reflect synaptic connectivity . Coherence , on the other hand , measures the broader effects of network-wide dynamics . Despite these differences , we saw that the measures are robustly correlated across channels at the beginning of our experiments . This would be expected in a network where stability was maintained with a Hebbian mechanism . In other words , direct connectivity , as reflected in SERR , drives correlated activity , which is reflected in coherence; conversely , correlated activity drives changes in connectivity ( see Network effects ) . These coupled mechanisms lead the network to a stable , steady state ( Fox and Stryker , 2017; Toyoizumi et al . , 2014; Zenke and Gerstner , 2017 ) . Notably , however , our conditioning protocol caused the two measures of connectivity to become less correlated across electrodes . This might seem surprising given that conditioning led to a significant mean increase in connectivity between S1 and M1 for both measures and that the changes in coherence were robustly predicted by the stimulus-evoked coherence . However , this decrease in the correlation between the measures after conditioning seems to be limited to high frequencies and may reflect a transient instability of the network due to the stimulation-induced perturbations in connectivity . Previous work has demonstrated that either activity dependent ( Jackson et al . , 2006; Lucas and Fetz , 2013; Nishimura et al . , 2013; Rebesco et al . , 2010; Song et al . , 2013 ) or paired electrical stimulation ( Rebesco and Miller , 2011; Seeman et al . , 2017 ) can lead to plastic changes in both primate and rodent cortex . Here we demonstrated that optogenetic stimulation at even a single location strengthens inter-area functional connectivity between brain areas . A similar observation was reported for one session of single-site electrical stimulation ( Seeman et al . , 2017 ) . This result is consistent with spike-timing dependent plasticity ( STDP ) rules ( Bi and Poo , 2001 ) . In particular , since the time difference between the activation of the primary ( pre-synaptic ) and secondary ( post-synaptic ) responses to optical stimulation is about 3\u20136 ms , repetitive stimulation should strengthen the connectivity from the site of stimulation to the other area . While stimulation-induced long-term potentiation ( LTP ) and STDP have been observed within local circuits ( Iriki et al . , 1989; Feldman , 2012; Shulz and Jacob , 2010 ) , and have been posited as the mechanism of stimulation-induced plasticity within M1 ( Lajoie et al . , 2017 ) this is the first study explaining large-scale changes across cortical networks . Notably , conditioning drove increases in coherence between S1 and M1 only in the theta band ( 4\u20138 Hz ) . This result is difficult to interpret because the conditioning stimulation frequency ( 5 or 7 Hz ) itself lies within the range of the theta band . It is possible that Hebbian mechanisms are selectively enhancing connectivity at the conditioning frequency . It\u2019s also possible that theta band coherence best reflects the plastic connections between these areas . Since we did not vary stimulation frequency outside of this range , no strong conclusions can be drawn . The temporal dynamics of both measures reveal a trend of increasing inter-area connectivity throughout the experiment . This trend suggests that neuroplastic changes start almost immediately after the start of stimulation . Interestingly , we observed unlearning of the stimulation-induced changes during passive recording , though some of the stimulation-induced changes persisted . Previous studies have shown that longer conditioning sessions ( 3\u201348 hr ) result in changes that are stable over timescales comparable to the length of conditioning ( Jackson et al . , 2006; Lucas and Fetz , 2013; Seeman et al . , 2017; Nishimura et al . , 2013; Rebesco and Miller , 2011 ) . Further experiments are required to estimate the stability of plasticity following optogenetic stimulation over longer time scales . Given that Hebbian rules have been used extensively to explain synaptic plasticity , we wanted to explore the idea that large-scale stimulation-induced changes are consistent with Hebbian plasticity . The strongest test of the Hebbian model is to compare the correlations directly induced by stimulation with the changes in network correlations observed after conditioning . Our ability to record artifact-free signals during stimulation allowed us to perform this test . We did find a predictive linear relationship between stimulus-evoked coherence and the changes in baseline coherence after conditioning . Furthermore , the model held for both simple and complex spatiotemporal patterns of stimulation-evoked activity . There is a large body of research on sensory cortical plasticity ( Merzenich et al . , 1983; Qi et al . , 2011 ) . This study differs in two key dimensions . First , previous work has largely focused on how changes in the statistics of sensory input and/or motor output affect the cortical representation in sensory cortex . In contrast , we have directly manipulated cortical circuits , without a detailed knowledge of the somatotopic map . Also , earlier work studied plasticity on the time scale of days to months , while we are studying changes across minutes . Despite these differences , both appear to support a key role for Hebbian learning in sensorimotor cortical plasticity . Still , a deeper understanding of the relationship between these bodies of work would require a study of intermediate time-frames as well , along with detailed cortical mapping . These are important questions for future work . The large-scale interface used in this study enabled robust estimation of functional connectivity and stimulation-evoked correlations . However , there are several limitations in our experimental setup . First , surface stimulation combined with high blue light absorption and scattering in tissue limits the depth of light penetration ( Yizhar et al . , 2011 ) . The ability to target specific cortical layers would help us understand the anatomical basis of the plasticity we observed . Second , surface \u00b5ECoG recordings reflect a summation of nearby neural activity , making comparisons to explicit synaptic learning rules difficult . Depth recordings would reveal more detailed information about spike timing , the role of different cortical layers , and the relationship between synaptic and large-scale plasticity . Lastly , the \u00b5ECoG arrays were placed acutely for each experiment . To investigate the long-term effects of stimulation we need stable , chronic recordings . Our results offer a proof-of-concept that optogenetic stimulation can drive predictable changes in network-scale connectivity . The success of optogenetics in NHP represents an important step forward for translational use ( Doroudchi et al . , 2011; Han , 2012 ) . The continued rapid progress in the field has the potential to bring cell-type specific neuromodulation therapies to the clinic . However , even where therapeutic approaches ultimately wind up using electrical stimulation , the advantages of optogenetics make it a powerful tool for better understanding the underlying mechanisms of plasticity and , thus , for the development of therapeutic applications of neuromodulation . This framework also provides scientific insight into the mechanisms of neural plasticity . Future efforts should focus on linking the plasticity results presented here with improvements in motor function or sensory perception , which will have important implications for stimulation-based therapies . \n Here , we give a brief summary of our large-scale optogenetic interface ( details in ( Yazdan-Shahmorad et al . , 2016 ) . We combined three existing techniques to implement a practical , large-scale interface for both manipulation and recording from the surface of the brain in two rhesus macaque monkeys . We used an efficient technique for infusion of the optogenetics viral vector ( AAV5 . CamKIIa . C1V1 ( E122T/E162T ) . TS . eYFP . WPRE . hGH , 2 . 5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01012 virus molecules/ml; Penn Vector Core , University of Pennsylvania , PA , USA , Addgene number: 35499 ) into primary somatosensory ( S1 ) and motor ( M1 ) cortices based on convection-enhanced delivery ( CED ) . We infused 200 \u03bcL of virus in four sites ( two in M1 and two in S1 ) in monkey G and 250 \u03bcL in five sites ( two in M1 and three in S1 ) of monkey J . Infusion rate started at 1 \u00b5l/min and was increased to 5 \u00b5l/min . Following infusion we used an artificial dura to protect the brain while maintaining optical access . We verified expression with epifluorescent imaging . To record the evoked responses in both M1 and S1 , we used either one or two 96 channel micro-electrocorticography ( \u03bc-ECoG ) arrays that were designed to allow minimally-attenuated ( Ledochowitsch et al . , 2015 ) optical access . In both animals , we observed reliable light evoked neural responses from the large channel-expressing areas . Optical stimulation was applied using a fiber optic ( core/cladding diameter: 62 . 5/125 um , Fiber Systems , TX , USA ) that was connected to a 488 nm laser ( PhoxX 488\u201360 , Omicron-Laserage , Germany ) and was positioned above the array ( Figure 1 ) . We used a Tucker-Davis Technologies system ( FL , USA ) for \u00b5-ECoG recording and to control the laser stimulus . We chose the locations of stimulation based on the results of our epifluorescent imaging ( see ( Yazdan-Shahmorad et al . , 2016 ) ) and whether we got a physiological response to light stimulation . Based on detailed histological and electrophysiological analyses , ( see ( Yazdan-Shahmorad et al . , 2016 ) ) we estimate that there was a uniform distribution of expression around our infusion sites and at the locations that we chose to stimulate . The monkeys were awake sitting in primate chairs for the duration of experiments . To ensure that the monkey remained awake , we provided random reward as well as audio and visual stimuli ( displaying a cartoon ) . In addition , we visually monitored the animal throughout the experiment . Our stimulation and recording paradigms consisted of baseline recording , testing and conditioning blocks ( Figure 4A ) . During baseline recording blocks we collected 5 min or 30 s of baseline activity . In test blocks we delivered 100 light pulses ( five msec duration at 5 Hz ) to each laser; pulses were alternated between laser sites in blocks of 10 pulses each in order to reduce the effects of habituation . For the conditioning blocks we stimulated through one or two lasers at a frequency of 5 or 7 Hz for 10 min . We repeated this protocol five times for each experiment . Our experiments consisted of single- and two-site stimulation with different laser configurations: i ) one or two lasers in M1 , ii ) one or two lasers in S1 and iii ) one laser in M1 and one laser in S1 . For two-site stimulation , the delay between the two lasers was 10 , 30 , 70 or 100 ms . We also included control sessions in which we kept the structure of passive recording and active testing blocks , but did not stimulate during the conditioning blocks . Monkeys were deeply sedated ( per above Surgical procedures ) and perfused transcardially with heparinized phosphate buffered saline ( PBS ) followed by cold 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffer . The brain was extracted and post-fixed in the same fixative for 24 hr at 4\u00b0C and then dissected into twelve 6 mm-thick coronal blocks using a custom matrix . After 7\u201310 days incubation in 30% sucrose , blocks were frozen and cut on a cryostat ( Microm , Germany ) into 50 \u03bcm thick sections . Representative sections were selected from each block and processed for EYFP immunocytochemistry using a free-floating technique . Sections were initially washed in PBS , incubated in 3% hydrogen peroxide in PBS for 10 min to quench endogenous peroxidase activity , then rinsed in two changes of 50% ethanol followed by three changes of PBS for 5 min each . Next we incubated the sections in 5% normal donkey serum in PBS for 1 hr to block non-specific binding . Primary rabbit polyclonal anti-GFP antibody ( Abcam , RRID: AB_303395 ) was diluted 1:15 , 000 in PBS containing 0 . 01% Triton X-100 and was applied to the tissue for 48 hr at 4\u00b0C . Sections were then rinsed in PBS , incubated in biotinylated donkey anti-rabbit antibody , ( 1:2 , 000 , Jackson Immunoresearch ) for 12 hr at 4\u00b0C , rinsed and incubated in ExtrAvidin ( Sigma-Aldrich , 1:5 , 000 ) for 5\u20136 hr in room temperature . Peroxidase was detected using a diaminobenzidine ( DAB ) chromogenic reagent ( Sigma-Aldrich ) . Sections were rinsed in PBS , mounted on gelatin-coated slides , air dried , dehydrated in graded alcohols , cleared in xylene and coverslipped with D . P . X . mounting media ( Sigma-Aldrich ) . Additional adjacent sections were stained with cresyl violet ( Nissl ) using standard techniques , to reveal cortical cytoarchitecture . Double immunofluorescence was performed using the similar to above approach although using combinations of primary antibodies from different host species for GFP and for the interneuron markers . Primary antibodies were: rabbit polyclonal anti-GFP antibody ( 1:10 , 000 , Abcam , GFP ab290 ) ; goat polyclonal anti-GFP antibody ( 1:1 , 000 , Abcam , ab5450 ) . These were paired with one of the following primary antibodies: mouse monoclonal antibody for parvalbumin , ( 1:1 , 000 , Sigma-Aldrich P3088 ) ; mouse monoclonal antibody for calbindin ( 1:800 Sigma-Aldrich CB-955 ) ; rat monoclonal antibody for somatostatin ( 1:200 , Millipore MAP354 ) ; rabbit polyclonal anti-GAD65/67 ( 1:500 , Millipore AB1511 ) ; a cocktail of mouse monoclonal antibody for GAD67 ( 1:500 , Millipore MAB5406 ) and mouse monoclonal antibody for GAD65 ( 1:1 , 000 , Sigma-Aldrich G1166 ) . Sections were blocked using normal donkey serum and processed for 4\u20136 hr in a mix of matching secondary antibodies; all of which were raised in donkey ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , 1:300 ) : anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488 , anti-goat Alexa Fluor 488 ( both for GFP ) . Interneuron markers were visualized using anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 594 , anti-rat Alexa Fluor 594; anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 594 . Sections were mounted using Vectashield ( Vector Labs ) and imaged using Zeiss LSM510 Meta confocal microscope ( Zeiss , Germany ) and 90i imaging system equipped with a CCD camera ( Nikon , Japan ) .", "headings": ["Abstract", "Introduction", "Results", "Discussion", "Materials and Methods"], "keywords": ["neuroscience"], "id": "elife-31034-v2"}
{"lay_summary": "Vision depends on the brain as well as on the eyes . Almost all information from the eyes travels to a brain region called the primary visual cortex . This large expanse of tissue at the back of the brain contains a detailed map of the visual world . Adults who suffer damage to part of the primary visual cortex become blind in the corresponding area of visual space , a phenomenon known as cortical blindness . Yet , adults with cortical blindness can also experience \u2018blindsight\u2019: they can still point correctly to bright , moving images , even though they claim they cannot see them . One of the roles of primary visual cortex is to act as a gateway to other , \u2018higher\u2019 visual areas of the brain . These regions process the input they receive from the primary visual cortex to generate a rich and coherent visual representation . But how do adults with blindsight , in whom the major gateway from the eyes to higher visual areas has been damaged , still manage to respond to visual stimuli ? By chance , Bridge et al . discovered a monkey whose unusual brain anatomy provides clues as to why this is possible . The monkey behaved much like its peers , leaping between the perches of its enclosure with ease . But when Bridge et al . tried to train the animal on a visual task , it proved unable to learn like the other monkeys . A brain scan revealed that it had almost no primary visual cortex , probably because of an abnormality that arose early in development . Further studies of the monkey\u2019s brain showed that the other structures involved in visual processing were in their usual places and were of normal size . Connections from the eyes to higher visual areas that bypass the primary visual cortex were normal , but were no stronger than in other monkeys . In fact , areas beyond the primary visual cortex showed no fundamental changes in how they processed visual information . The brain of this monkey had thus adapted to early loss of the major gateway from the eyes to higher visual cortex . Visual areas of the brain beyond the primary visual cortex continued to work as normal , helping to minimize vision loss . Because the visual brain differs little between primates , this discovery could also benefit patients with blindsight . It suggests that targeting higher visual areas could further improve vision in patients with damage to the primary visual cortex .", "article": "Lesions of primary visual cortex ( V1 ) lead to loss of conscious visual perception with significant impact on human patients . Understanding the neural consequences of such damage may aid the development of rehabilitation methods . In this rare case of a Rhesus macaque ( monkey S ) , likely born without V1 , the animal\u2019s in-group behaviour was unremarkable , but visual task training was impaired . With multi-modal magnetic resonance imaging , visual structures outside of the lesion appeared normal . Visual stimulation under anaesthesia with checkerboards activated lateral geniculate nucleus of monkey S , while full-field moving dots activated pulvinar . Visual cortical activation was sparse but included face patches . Consistently across lesion and control monkeys , functional connectivity analysis revealed an intact network of bilateral dorsal visual areas temporally correlated with V5/MT activation , even without V1 . Despite robust subcortical responses to visual stimulation , we found little evidence for strengthened subcortical input to V5/MT supporting residual visual function or blindsight-like phenomena . \n Primary visual cortex ( V1 ) of primates is the major gateway for feedforward input of visual information from the retina via the lateral geniculate nucleus ( LGN ) into a network of over 30 extrastriate visual areas ( Felleman and Van Essen , 1991; Markov et al . , 2014; Schmidt et al . , 2018 ) . V1 contains a complete , high resolution retinotopic map and contributes to cortical processing by computing local spatio-temporal correlations of the input , which is evident in its neural representations of local visual features ( orientation , spatial frequency , temporal frequency , direction , colour , binocular disparity ) ( e . g . Hubel and Wiesel , 1959;\u00a0Movshon et al . , 1978; Parker et al . , 2016 ) . The direct contribution of V1 signals to conscious sight is a subject of ongoing scientific debate ( e . g . Stoerig , 2006; Ffytche and Zeki , 2011 ) and is thought to involve feedback as well as feedforward input to V1 ( Ress and Heeger , 2003 ) . At the centre of this debate have been patients with V1 lesions exhibiting residual vision - often without visual awareness - a condition termed Blindsight ( Riddoch , 1917; Weiskrantz et al . , 1974; Cowey , 2010 ) . Previous data on bilaterally cortically blind macaque monkeys suggest that there is a dissociation between use of vision for guiding movement and for awareness and recognition ( Leopold , 2012 ) . Specifically , monkey Helen , who had V1 removed bilaterally , was able to navigate around the world but unable to recognise faces or food ( Humphrey , 1974 ) . The lesions to Helen were made in adulthood , which may have affected the amount of residual vision . Macaque monkeys who received a unilateral V1 lesion at two months of age exhibited more residual vision as adults than monkeys who received their lesions in adulthood ( Moore et al . , 1996 ) . Cortical blindness due to bilateral damage to the primary visual cortex of humans is fortunately rare . There are a few cases of damage acquired in adulthood , some of whom have been extensively studied ( de Gelder et al . , 2008; Hervais-Adelman et al . , 2015; Arcaro et al . , 2018 ) , but also a number of children who acquired lesions congenitally or through perinatal stroke ( Mundinano et al . , 2017 ) . The presence of residual visual function suggests that functional visual networks can develop or be sustained in the absence of the main visual input to cortex . In monkeys , in the absence of primary visual cortex , a number of potential pathways have been proposed to convey visual information from the eyes to extrastriate visual cortex . Direct input to extrastriate visual cortex bypassing V1 may arise from the lateral geniculate nucleus ( LGN ) or the pulvinar nucleus directly to extrastriate visual areas V2 , V3 , V4 , V5/MT and inferotemporal cortex ( Wong-Riley , 1976; Sincich et al . , 2004; Kaas and Lyon , 2007; Warner et al . , 2010; Gattass et al . , 2014 ) . In humans , both pulvinar and LGN inputs to V5/MT have been implicated ( de Gelder et al . , 2008; Ajina et al . , 2015b ) . In addition to its direct retinal input , the LGN also receives projections from the superior colliculus ( SC ) ( Harting et al . , 1991; Stepniewska et al . , 1999 ) . The pulvinar nucleus receives input from the SC , although likely not into the appropriate subdivision for projectiions to V5/MT , and pulvinar might receive surviving early projections directly from the retina ( Stepniewska et al . , 1999; Warner et al . , 2010 ) . It has been suggested that early-life V1 lesions in particular might lead to less pruning of the retina-pulvinar-V5/MT pathway and that this might contribute to \u2018blindsight\u2019 ( Warner et al . , 2015 ) . Macaque monkey S in the current study showed bilaterally enlarged lateral ventricles that appeared to have expanded into space usually occupied by V1 . This gross pathology of the cerebral cortex was most likely to have been acquired developmentally or perinatally . Previous data have implicated roles in residual vision for the LGN , pulvinar , SC and the extrastriate visual cortical networks including motion area V5/MT . Our aim here was to use magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) to determine the integrity of the structural and functional networks underlying residual visual function in this monkey with a long-standing anatomical lesion of primary visual cortex . \n A female Rhesus macaque ( monkey S; 7 years; 6 . 25 kg ) initially showed comparable behaviour to cage mates , and successfully followed the same familiarisation and training pattern for coming out from the home enclosure into a transport box or primate chair ( Mason et al . , 2019 ) . Training in both cases was completed in a comparable time frame to other monkeys trained at the same time . Subsequently , task training took place five days per week over 18 months \u2013 this involved visual tasks but was intended for a decision-making study , rather than for measurement of visual performance . Training began with a simple task in a transport box , \u2018anytouch\u2019 , where monkey S was rewarded for touching the screen anywhere during presentation of an array of colourful typographical characters . Monkey S managed to complete 10 trials in 3 min within one week of training and thus progressed to the next training stage . Task \u2018oneplace\u2019 involved targeted touching of a single coloured typographical character at a random location . Monkey S reached 40\u201350 trials in increments of 10 trials , but continued with the lowest complexity of visual presentations over six weeks of training . The 40\u201350 trials were completed in a time window ranging between 30\u201391 min per session . This was a particularly poor performance compared with other monkeys progressing through this auto-shaping programme . Monkey S was unable to progress further from the initial stages of \u2018oneplace\u2019 . At this phase of the training , monkey S was transferred to a primate chair ( seated , but without head clamp or eye movement control ) and to a different reward schedule ( juice instead of pellets ) , and \u2018oneplace\u2019 was attempted again . Monkey S still worked much more slowly than other monkeys , attaining 40 rewarded trials in 33 min over many weeks of training sessions , whereas typical performance is expected to be closer to 100 rewarded trials in 18\u201325 min . Monkey S would typically no longer respond to the task when the number of trials or the complexity of the task were increased . We tried using different effectors ( e . g . a response lever and a metal knob ) in an attempt to improve task learning and performance . Initially , monkey S was trained to hold the lever and then release it for reward . Although she did well during this initial behavioural training , monkey S was unable to learn to release the lever in response to visual stimulation . When monkey S was required to do a simple spatial search using the lever in response to a change in target colour on the screen , she typically only completed up to 10\u201320 trials towards the end of six months of training and only when the trainer remained present in the room . During this time , rudimentary checks determined that , while seated in the primate chair , monkey S could orient towards rewards and objects when held up in front of her and when moved around in her visual field . Finally , monkey S was returned to the transport box touch screen training with \u2018oneplace\u2019 . She completed up to 40 trials for banana pellets after 6 weeks of training , but still required 41\u2013103 mins to complete a session , making between 23\u201351 errors . An error was recorded when monkey S touched the touch screen anywhere apart from the alphanumeric character . In spite of the inability of S to perform these tested psychophysical tasks , behavioural assessment in the home enclosure by a clinical neurologist and two neuroscientists showed no qualitatively different patterns of locomotion and visual orienting towards other monkeys and people in the room . There was some indication that patterns of eye fixation might be atypical , but no quantitative assessment was undertaken . However , when monkey S was offered treats , she would start repeatedly running past the treat and pick it up with a sideways reach while running - rather than coming forwards , fixating the treat and reaching for it in a more controlled way . As monkey S so obviously differed from the animals co-housed with her , we performed a brain scan . Structural MRI revealed an almost complete loss of primary visual cortex ( V1 ) ( Figure 1 , top ) , consistent with presumptive bilateral visual field loss ( see Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . Clinical assessment of the MRI scans and records suggested no injury or history that could explain this lesion and that this was probably a congenital or perinatal condition . The LGN , the pulvinar , the SC and V5/MT are four structures that have been commonly thought to support residual vision in blindsight . Therefore , our MRI analysis of the visual brain focussed more specifically on those four brain structures . In humans with lesions of V1 , which result in hemianopia , the LGN is often reduced in size , due to retrograde degeneration ( Miki et al . , 2005; Bridge et al . , 2011 ) . A similar result has also been found in the adult marmoset ( Atapour et al . , 2017 ) . When we investigated the structure of the LGN in monkey S and four female control Rhesus macaques of a similar age with intact visual systems , there was no obvious reduction in size of the structure from inspection of the images ( Figure 1 ) . The volume of the LGN in the control monkeys was measured at 50 . 0 mm3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04 . 7 mm3 and 51 . 5 mm3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05 . 1 mm3 ( mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD ) for the left and right hemispheres . In monkey S , the comparable values were 47 . 0 mm3 and 48 . 5 mm3 respectively . Thus , the structure seems not to have been affected by retrograde degeneration . Similarly , the superior colliculus ( SC ) was also comparable in size in monkey S ( left\u00a0=\u00a030 . 0 mm3; right\u00a0=\u00a031 . 6 mm3 ) and control monkeys ( left\u00a0=\u00a031 . 0 mm3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01 . 9 mm3 and right\u00a0=\u00a030 . 5 mm3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03 . 3 mm3 ) ( mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD ) . Finally , the pulvinar was also of a similar size in monkey S ( left\u00a0=\u00a040 . 2 mm3; right\u00a0=\u00a041 . 9 mm3 ) and control monkeys ( left\u00a0=\u00a037 . 7 mm3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04 . 4 mm3 and right\u00a0=\u00a035 . 9 mm3\u00b13 . 2 mm3 ) ( mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD ) . To investigate the cortical changes in more detail , we acquired post mortem T2*-weighted images in monkey S and for the right hemisphere of a control monkey ( M131 ) ( Figure 2 ) . The stripe of Gennari is visible in both monkey S and the control monkey . However , the stripe is closer to the pial surface in monkey S , rather than in the middle of the cortical ribbon , as seen in the control monkey . This could suggest that the superficial layers are particularly reduced as a consequence of the extensive lesion . Measurement of cortical thickness in V1 in both monkeys indicated that monkey S has substantially thinner cortex around the lesion . By contrast , extrastriate visual area V5/MT appeared to have a thickness of about 2 mm , which is comparable to the control monkey . T1w/T2w structural MRI images provide a qualitative signal indicative of myelination within the cortical ribbon in vivo ( Glasser and Van Essen , 2011; Large et al . , 2016 ) . To investigate whether there were structural consequences of the loss of major feedforward input to extrastriate visual cortex , we took such scans from monkey S and compared the results with those previously obtained from the same four female control Rhesus monkeys as in the previous section ( Figure 3 ) . These myelin-weighted images show a distinct band indicative of dense myelination in the lower layers of extrastriate cortical area V5/MT on the posterior bank of the dorsal superior temporal sulcus ( STS ) , but not in adjacent cortical areas . This band is similar in location and extent to the four control monkeys . We measured the mean surface area of this region of distinct myelination ( top third of image intensity values ) in dorsal STS , likely to comprise V5/MT and MST , as 86 . 9 mm2 ( left hemisphere ) and 78 . 8 mm2 . This is in the range of published data of 82 . 4 mm2 ( SD =\u00a0\u00b18 . 9; n\u00a0=\u00a010 hemispheres ) obtained by the same method ( Large et al . , 2016 ) . We conducted eight scanning sessions in seven Rhesus macaque monkeys . First , we analysed the BOLD responses to a contrast-reversing , full-field flickering checkerboard . We then restricted all further analyses to those monkeys that had significant BOLD activation in the LGN ( z\u00a0>\u00a02 . 3 ) to this stimulus ( see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods and Figure 4; Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . One scanning session from each of four monkeys fulfilled this criterion , including the first of two separate scanning sessions with monkey S . Figure 4 shows\u00a0the BOLD activation in response to the flickering checkerboard compared to a mid-grey screen . The strong activation evident in the LGN of monkey S , is consistent with the intact structure shown in Figure 1 , and suggests that information from the retina can reach the brain . The control monkeys included in these analyses showed similar activation in the LGN in response to this stimulus . In contrast to the strong activation in the LGN , there was less activation evident in visual cortical regions , especially in the primary visual cortex of monkey S ( see Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2 for a complete series of sections ) . Even in the control monkeys there was considerable variability in the location and extent of cortical BOLD activation . The checkerboard stimulus is expected to activate V1 , but even in some control animals where V1 is intact , the activation was not extensive . Some of this variability may be due to effects of anaesthesia on visual responses ( see Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1; see Discussion ) . While the checkerboard stimulus is designed to activate early visual areas , a moving dot stimulus may evoke greater activation in some extrastriate areas , particularly where there is damage to early areas . The responses to moving dots compared to stationary dots are shown in Figure 5 . The level of activation to this type of stimulation was lower in all animals , including monkey S . Control monkey M901 showed very little activation to the moving dots in any brain region , in contrast to the strong activation evident in the LGN to flickering checkerboards . Monkey S showed some LGN activation on the left side of the brain and in the pulvinar situated posterior to the LGN . Cortical activation was sparsely distributed around the brain , with some activation within the dorsal part of the Superior Temporal Sulcus ( STS ) near area V5/MT in monkey S ( see Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1 ) and in control monkeys M142 and M902 . The whole brain analyses suggested that activation was greatest to the flickering checkerboard , particularly in the LGN . To quantify activation and compare responses in monkey S with the control monkeys , the % BOLD signal was extracted from the LGN , pulvinar , V1 and area V5/MT . Masks were defined anatomically on the brains of each individual monkey in structural space using a standard atlas as a guide ( National Institute of Mental Health Macaque Template - NMT ) ( Seidlitz et al . , 2018 ) . The activation levels in Figure 6 support the observation that the activity in LGN is greatest to the checkerboards across all animals , including monkey S . For control monkeys , V1 activation tended to be lower than for the LGN , with a median ratio of V1:LGN of 0 . 83 ( range 0 . 2\u20130 . 92 ) , but this was 0 for monkey S as she showed no V1 activation . Furthermore , monkey S did not show significant activation in anatomically defined area V5/MT to either stimulus but did in the pulvinar , though only in response to the moving dots . The timeseries from the LGN ( checkerboard ) and the pulvinar ( moving dots ) activation for monkey S illustrate the variability of the BOLD signal in these regions ( see Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . The only other monkey with activation in the pulvinar to the moving dots ( M902 ) showed similar activation to the checkerboard stimulus , a pattern not seen in monkey S . The pathways most often proposed to underlie blindsight in human patients with hemianopia include the visual motion complex hMT+ ( thought to comprise visual areas V5/MT and MST ) and this region often shows significant activation in response to moving stimuli , similar to the stimulus used here ( Ajina et al . , 2015a; Ajina and Bridge , 2016 ) , and to contrast defined stimuli ( Ajina et al . , 2015c ) . Thus , it was surprising that anatomically defined V5/MT in monkey S did not show significant activation to either type of stimulation . To investigate the activation patterns in monkey S in more detail , Figure 7 shows a series of slices , 3 mm apart , through dorsal aspects of the superior temporal sulcus ( STS ) including visual areas of hMT+\u00a0in the human visual system ( see also Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1 for a 1 mm series of sections through the whole brain of monkey S ) . While there was no spatially extensive region of activation , there were a number of regions within the sulcus showing BOLD activation ( z\u00a0>\u00a02 . 3 ) to the moving dot stimulus , including in area MST on the anterior bank and area FST at the bottom of the sulcus , but mainly outside V5/MT . Since the monkeys were all anaesthetised , it was difficult to determine whether the scarcity of cortical activity in monkey S was due to effects of the anaesthetic or reflected a real difference in signal processing . For instance , it is conceivable that the heavily enlarged , fluid-filled ventricles within the visual cortex that formed the lesion could have differentially affected the pattern of action of anaesthesia in monkey S . Figure 6 showed no significant V5/MT activation in monkey S to either checkerboard or moving dots stimuli , so to understand the nature of the response in area V5/MT , we performed a connectivity analysis . Rather than using the amplitude of BOLD activation , this analysis uses the fluctuations in the signal over time to determine areas that are likely to have common inputs or to be connected . This method was used previously to investigate the functional connectivity patterns of temporal and frontal regions in macaque monkeys ( Vincent et al . , 2007; Sallet et al . , 2013; Hutchison et al . , 2012; Mars et al . , 2013 ) . Figure 8\u00a0shows the regions of the cortex with a pattern of BOLD activation that was significantly correlated to the time-series signal extracted from V5/MT on the right side of the brain when the monkey was shown the moving dot stimulus . The nature of the analysis ensured that V5/MT in the right hemisphere must have a significant correlation , but clearly the two hemispheres had similar connectivity as the pattern of activation we found was bilateral . This would be expected since both sides of the brain received the same visual stimulation . In addition to the STS , a large swathe of dorsal extrastriate cortex and parietal areas showed significant correlation , both in the control monkeys and in monkey S . Finally , the network connected to V5/MT included the Frontal Eye Fields ( FEF ) in monkey S and all control monkeys . This connectivity analysis was also performed using the LGN and the pulvinar as a seed . Neither of these seeds produced a consistent pattern of connectivity with any cortical structures either in the control monkeys or monkey S . The structural data indicated that both V5/MT and LGN were intact in monkey S , and fMRI activation data suggested that LGN and pulvinar were activated by a flickering checkerboard and moving dots respectively . Furthermore , extrastriate visual area V5/MT appeared to have a similar functional connectivity profile to this area as observed in control monkeys . The cortical activation evoked by visual stimulation was variable in all the monkeys , so to investigate the connection between V5/MT and visual subcortical structures , we performed probabilistic tractography on diffusion-weighted images . Figure 9 shows the tracts between LGN and V5/MT and pulvinar and V5/MT , in each case with the threshold set at 10% of the maximum number of tracts reaching the target structure . In the data shown , the seed structure was either LGN or pulvinar and the target was ipsilateral\u00a0V5/MT . The six control monkeys showed reasonably consistent tracts with pulvinar<->V5/MT tract generally running superior to the LGN<->V5/MT tract . Running the tracts in the other direction with V5/MT as the seed region produced comparable results . Monkey S also showed tracts between these structures , but the location and extent of the lesion meant that the actual route followed was different and the tracts seemed to be less direct as they appeared to project around the lesion . The images of the tracts only give the route taken by the path , and do not allow comparison of tract strength or integrity . In order to quantify how the tracts in monkey S compare with the control animals , we performed two additional analyses . Firstly , we calculated the percentage of tracts terminating in the target structure . This gives an indication of the size of the tract , though this is not a direct measure of real pathway size . Secondly , we extracted the fractional anisotropy ( FA ) from each of the tracts independently . These metrics are shown in Figure 10 , and indicate that the microstructure of the tracts in monkey S was most likely intact . But the number of tracts that could be identified between V5/MT and either LGN or pulvinar was very low , with the percentage of tracts reaching target ranging between 0 . 01\u20130 . 03% in all cases for monkey S . Compared to control monkeys , this was at least an order of magnitude lower . Given the significantly weakened tract between V5/MT and subcortical nuclei indicated by the diffusion imaging , there is little evidence to suggest that a strengthening of these connections underlies whatever residual vision was present in monkey S . Residual vision can manifest in several different ways , including the ability to determine information from faces , as shown in patient TN ( Burra et al . , 2013 ) , a function that has been suggested to survive loss of V1 . To investigate whether any responses to faces could be detected in monkey S and two of the control monkeys , we presented full field stimuli of monkey faces . Blocks of neutral and threatening faces were interleaved with a blank screen . When we compared the BOLD response to all face stimuli compared to a mid-grey background ( similar to the localizer used by Liu et al . , 2015 ) , we found clearly defined clusters of activation for the two most commonly identified temporal lobe face patches in the Rhesus macaque: the anterior ( likely AF , Tsao et al . ( 2008 ) ) and middle ( likely MF , Tsao et al . ( 2008 ) ) face patch located in the fundus of ventral STS ( Figure 11 ) . One control showed only the anterior face patch . While the locations of these areas are as previously described in macaques ( Tsao et al . , 2003; Pinsk et al . , 2005; Tsao et al . , 2008; Bell et al . , 2009 ) , we did not check the contrast against scrambled faces . We did not observe any specific differences in activation between threatening and neutral facial expressions in the STS , consistent with previous studies ( Hoffman et al . , 2007; Hadj-Bouziane et al . , 2008 ) . \n The majority of literature relating to residual visual ability following damage to V1 describes adult-onset , unilateral damage due to stroke or trauma ( e . g . Cowey , 2010 ) . In these cases , the comparison between the intact and damaged hemispheres appears to show that the LGN and optic tracts are atrophied ( Bridge et al . , 2011 ) . There are far fewer cases of peri-natal damage , but Millington et al . ( 2014 ) showed that even when the damage to occipital cortex is congenital , there is reduction of optic tract size in the affected hemisphere , implying a reduction in LGN size . A recent imaging study of a patient with bilateral occipital damage suggested atrophy of the LGN bilaterally ( Arcaro et al . , 2018 ) . Giaschi et al . ( 2003 ) described a young man with bilateral damage to the occipital cortex suffered at birth . hMT+\u00a0in that case also appeared to be structurally normal , but did not show evidence of activation to visual stimulation . It was not possible to determine whether the LGN was intact from the images provided in that paper . Despite the large cortical lesion , in contrast to much of the human \u2018Blindsight\u2019 literature , we found the LGN in monkey S to be intact . Combined lesion and silencing studies in macaques reinforce the requirement for an intact LGN to support remaining visual function after V1 lesions ( Schmid et al . , 2010 ) . Preservation of structure and function of the LGN after a visual cortical lesion might depend on age at the time of lesion as well as the extent of the lesion , as studies in marmosets suggest ( Atapour et al . , 2017; Yu et al . , 2018; Hendrickson et al . , 2015 ) . This would be consistent with a very early loss of V1 , possibly in utero , for monkey S . The increased resolution of the structural scanning and consistent location of V5/MT in the macaque ( Zeki , 1974; Van Essen et al . , 1981 ) allowed the myelination of this area to be identified in vivo . Even with such extensive loss in the occipital lobe and thus , the loss of a major input ( Maunsell and van Essen , 1983 ) , this region of the STS appeared normal in monkey S . Conversely , the variability of hMT+\u00a0location in humans ( Large et al . , 2016 ) makes analysis of the myelin more challenging , and thus limits our opportunities to compare across the two species . In spite of the apparent structural integrity of the LGN and V5/MT , the tracts between these regions appeared to be weaker , both in terms of the number of streamlines identified between them and the necessity for a more circuitous route to avoid the lesion . The circuitous route also points to an early , developmental origin for the lesion . Previous work in adult-acquired hemianopia in humans has indicated that tracts between LGN and hMT+\u00a0are similar in microstructure to sighted tracts in those showing some form of residual vision ( Bridge et al . , 2008; Ajina et al . , 2015b ) . However , monkey S had very large bilateral lesions that may have caused greater disruption to the normal pattern of white matter connectivity . Nonetheless , the microstructure of these tracts appeared to be close to control values , as was also the case in previous human studies , so the reduction in size could reflect a reduction in feedback connections into the LGN rather than a change in feedforward connectivity into cortex . Performing BOLD fMRI in anaesthetised macaques is challenging even when the monkey has a healthy visual system; this is evident in the variability in the amount of cortical activation in the control monkeys . The level of BOLD activation is affected by general anaesthesia parameters such as type and depth ( Hutchison et al . , 2014; Vincent et al . , 2007 ) , although previous results do not explain the potential differences in dorsal and temporal visual activations we see . We used isoflurane anaesthetic agent , under which it is known that some visual cortical activation is preserved , at least at low doses ( Logothetis et al . , 1999; Vincent et al . , 2007; Goense and Logothetis , 2008 ) . We mitigated some of this effect , by restricting our quantitative analyses to those sessions that showed significant activation of the LGN with a checkerboard stimulus . However , we cannot exclude the possibility that some of the variability in cortical activity , specifically for area V5/MT , is due to effects of the anaesthetics which vary at shorter time scales within a fMRI session . It has also been suggested that some variability in cortical activation and functional connectivity as measured with fMRI could be linked to inter-individual differences in the morphology of sulcal patterns ( Lopez-Persem et al . , 2019; Xu et al . , 2019 ) . In the same context , some of the small patches of activations that we see around dorsal and ventral STS in monkey S could be spurious signal fluctuations . However , for monkey S , looking through the whole brain ( see Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2 , Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1 ) , we find only few regions with significant activation . A further challenge in monkey S is that the damage is bilateral . In much of the previous work in humans , the sighted hemisphere has been used as a control area , therefore controlling for any global variation in activation levels . The most evident activation is clearly in the LGN in response to checkerboard stimulation , which is equivalent to that seen in controls and suggests the visual pathway prior to V1 is intact . The activation level to moving dots was considerably lower , but that would be predicted from the properties of LGN cells . By contrast , the activation pattern in the pulvinar to moving dots for monkey S appeared to be as great as in the best control subject , which is consistent with an increased role for this structure due to the perinatal nature of the lesion ( Warner et al . , 2015 ) . Moving dot stimuli in the healthy and hemianopic human brain consistently lead to activation of hMT+ , even when damage is bilateral ( Arcaro et al . , 2018; Bridge et al . , 2010 ) . Thus , the lack of consistent activation in V5/MT in monkey S and some controls suggests a suppressive effect of the anaesthetic , which was most evident with larger doses of the volatile anaesthetic . Also , drifting eye movements and inappropriate ocular accommodation under anaesthesia could have affected the functional activation we measured . Nevertheless , for visual motion stimuli we saw in monkey S foci of activation in the region of V5/MT in dorsal STS of both hemispheres , suggesting any activation may be sub-threshold and difficult to detect with BOLD . Even without the strong visually-evoked V5/MT responses , it was possible to map out a functional network of cortical areas showing a similar BOLD response over time to V5/MT . This was very similar in monkey S and the control monkeys , suggesting that this inter-cortical activity in the macaque visual brain was not affected by the loss of V1 . Interestingly , none of the monkeys included LGN in this functional network , perhaps reflecting the weak anatomical connectivity between these areas in typical animals ( Sincich et al . , 2004 ) . For all monkeys , FEF was included in the functional network , as would be predicted from a knowledge of the V5/MT connectivity ( Schall et al . , 1995 ) . Surprisingly , we also found activation of two of the most pertinent face patches along the STS in monkey S \u2013 in the context of little other consistent activations . Without the comparison to scrambled faces , this result needs further scrutiny . However , if confirmed , this result would suggest other intact subcortical inputs in this monkey to temporal visual cortex from pulvinar , claustrum , and amygdala supporting these activations ( Grimaldi et al . , 2016 ) . Given that the day-to-day behaviour of monkey S did not cause concern , the monkey presumably had a reasonable amount of residual vision , in spite of the extensive cortical lesions . Considering all the evidence , it appears that the dorsal visual network was intact , and would have the potential to support active vision ( Koyama et al . , 2004; Davare et al . , 2011 ) , as seen in a number of human patients with damage to the visual cortical system ( Goodale and Milner , 1992; Bridge et al . , 2013; Goodale , 2011 ) . Retinal information may reach the dorsal visual areas via the weak pathways with LGN and pulvinar , but the lack of consistent visual cortex activation , possibly due to the anaesthesia , makes this question difficult to answer . The lack of significant differences between monkey S and controls in the pathways between LGN-V5/MT and pulvinar-V5/MT suggests either or both could support residual visual abilities . So , what might be the source of visual input that supports visual function and presumably shaped an intact extrastriate visual brain network ? One possibility could be some preserved V1 connectivity . But given the size and location of the bilateral lesion , this argument is difficult to sustain . Another possibility would parallel , alternative inputs to cortex . Earlier MRI studies in V1-lesioned monkeys have shown parallel activation in early visual areas , like V2 , V3 and V4 as well as V5/MT ( Schmid et al . , 2010 ) . It has been suggested that V2 might be a crucial contribution to visual function and awareness ( Merigan et al . , 1993 ) . These visual cortical areas also receive direct subcortical input ( Wong-Riley , 1976; Kaas and Lyon , 2007 ) . Based on our knowledge of functional representations , the activation of face patches in temporal cortex discussed above must be driven by a visual subcortical input other than to V5/MT . Since it is likely to be a wider pattern of cortical activation that underpins visual awareness and behaviour ( e . g . Papanikolaou et al . , 2019 ) , it might be supported by a wider pattern of weak , parallel subcortical inputs directly to extrastriate visual cortex . Visual structures , both cortical and subcortical , outside of the large lesion of primary visual cortex remained intact in monkey S with little evidence of atrophy . This suggests a role in residual visual function , consistent with an intact network of extrastriate cortical visual areas that was comparable to control monkeys . While the structural connectivity between the subcortical regions and area V5/MT was weak , the microstructure was intact . Thus , unlike adult-acquired lesions , there appeared to be a maintenance of structural integrity of the visual system when V1 is damaged neonatally . This may explain the increased residual function both , in monkey S and in children with early damage to the visual cortex . \n Seven macaque monkeys ( Macaca mulatta , two female and five male ) , weighing 6 . 25 to 12 . 3 kg ( mean weight\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SE: 9 . 1 kg\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00 . 8 ) underwent functional and structural MRI scans under general anaesthesia . Previously collected anatomical data from a further 10 macaque monkeys ( four females for myelin/structural scans; six males for diffusion-weighted\u00a0imaging ( DWI ) /structural scans; weighing 4 . 35 kg to 11 kg ) were analysed from MRI scans ( MPRAGE , T2w , DWI ) , also obtained under general anaesthesia . The structural myelin data of the four control monkeys have previously been reported elsewhere ( Large et al . , 2016 ) , and so have the DWI data from four of the six controls ( Rafal et al . , 2015 ) . The monkeys were socially housed together in same sex groups of between 2 and 6 animals and housing and husbandry were in compliance with the ARRIVE guidelines of the European Directive ( 2010/63/EU ) for the care and use of laboratory animals . All animal procedures were carried out in accordance with Home Office ( UK ) Regulations and European Union guidelines ( EU directive 86/609/EEC; EU Directive 2010/63/EU ) . Transport box training and primate chair training protocols employed here were recently described elsewhere ( Mason et al . , 2019 ) . For task training , monkey S was usually trained once a day for five days per week ( typically 30 min \u2013 105 min per day ) . But for double transport device acclimatization ( transition from transport box to primate chair ) , monkey S was trained twice a day for five days per week . Task training in the transport box took place in the morning and acclimatization to enter a primate chair in the afternoon . For touchscreen training , monkey S was brought in the transport box from the home enclosure to a test cubicle ( as previously described in Mitchell et al . , 2007 ) . In brief , the transport box was fixed to a touch-sensitive video screen ( 380\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0280 mm , 800\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0600 pixel ) . Stimulus presentation , recording of screen touches , and reward delivery were computer-controlled . For a correct touch , a dispenser delivered 190 mg banana-flavoured pellets accompanied by a click . In this training environment , monkeys progress through increasing the number of completed\u00a0trials day-by-day and following a set of tasks of increasing difficulty . The first two simple tasks in this sequence were attempted by monkey S: ( i ) In \u2018anytouch\u2019 , monkeys were rewarded for touching the screen anywhere during presentation of an array of colourful , alphanumeric characters ( length up to 34 mm ) on a black background; ( ii ) in \u2018oneplace\u2019 , a single coloured typographical character was presented on a black background in a random location and remained on the screen until the monkey had touched it . A touch caused the character to disappear and a reward pellet to be delivered . Working with the touch screen while seated upright in a primate chair was another training set . Once acclimated to the primate chair , reward pellets were re-placed with banana smoothie taken from a spout and delivered by a reward pump . The primate chair was positioned directly in front of the touchscreen monitor ( as described above ) . Monkey S\u2019s head was approximately 160 mm away from the touchscreen and her hand reach 100 mm . Tasks were the same as described above for the transport box . Further training switched to a different effector , using a paddle lever touch sensor attached to the front of the primate chair . This task required monkey S to press a lever for less than 500 msec , while a red circle ( 5 mm in diameter , approx . 1 . 8\u00b0 of visual angle ) was displayed in the centre of the touchscreen and to release the lever when the circle switched to green . In addition , monkey S had to reach out to touch one of two white squares ( 50 mm in size , approx . 18\u00b0 of visual angle ) that were then presented on the touchscreen to the left and right of the circle . In another version of the task , the lever was replaced with a metal knob . Here , the training program displayed a red circle ( diameter\u00a0=\u00a040 mm , approx . 14\u00b0 of visual angle ) on the touchscreen , directly above the knob . Touching the metal knob for 200 msec delivered the reward and the red circle disappeared for a 2 s inter\u2013trial interval ( ITI ) . Monkey S was initially trained to hold a metal bolt and her hand was guided toward the metal knob . During training , different fluid rewards ( e . g . different banana smoothie concentrations , blackcurrant juice , apple juice ) were used to determine preferences . For the later part of the task training , monkey S was on a fluid control protocol to increase motivation: water bottles were removed each night before the next day\u2019s training session and replaced after each daily training session . The seven monkeys undergoing functional MRI scans were sedated with a mixture of ketamine ( 7 . 5 mg/kg ) , xylazine ( 0 . 125 mg/kg ) and medetomidine ( 0 . 1 mg/kg ) . They were intubated , an i . v . cannula was inserted into the saphenous vein for fluid infusion ( Hartmann\u2019s solution , 2 ml/kg/hr ) and non-invasive BP , rectal temperature , heart rate and oxygen saturation were continuously monitored . They were placed in an MRI compatible stereotaxic frame with anaesthetic cream ( EMLA cream ) applied to pressure points , and \u2018viscotears\u2019 applied to stop the eyes from drying . During the scan , they were ventilated with a gaseous mixture of isoflurane in oxygen ( range 0 . 8% to 2 . 0% ) with end-tidal CO2 maintained around 38 mmHg . Between scan sequences approximately hourly , legs were massaged and \u2018viscotears\u2019 were re-applied . The isoflurane anaesthetic gas mixture during scanning sequences was kept to a level commensurate with adequate anaesthesia through monitoring of physiological parameters ( heart rate , end-tidal CO2 , blood pressure ) and , between sequences , through pinch test . In the majority of monkeys during visual presentation , isoflurane concentration was at 1% ( range: 0 . 8% to 1 . 6% ) . In anaesthetised monkeys , visual activation can vary for a number of reasons , including accommodation , drifting eye movements and level of anaesthesia . In our data , there was some indication that lower average levels of isoflurane were associated with significant visual stimulation responses , but the pattern was variable ( see\u00a0Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . Procedures for monkeys undergoing structural scans are described elsewhere ( Large et al . , 2016; Rafal et al . , 2015 ) . Anesthetised monkeys were placed in an MRI-compatible stereotactic frame ( Crist Instrument ) in sphinx position . For visual presentations , eyelids were held open with surgical tape . Data were acquired with a 3T clinical MRI scanner , using a four-channel phased-array radiofrequency coil in conjunction with a local transmission coil ( H . Kolster , Windmiller Kolster Scientific , Fresno , CA ) . Five high-resolution ( voxel size 0 . 5 mm x 0 . 5 mm x 0 . 5 mm , TE\u00a0=\u00a04 . 04 ms; TR\u00a0=\u00a02500 ms; flip angle\u00a0=\u00a08\u00b0 , 128 slices ) T1-weighted structural images were acquired using a 3D magnetisation-prepared rapid-acquisition gradient echo ( MPRAGE ) sequence . To compute myelin-weighted images , we also acquired 13 T2w 3D turbo spin-echo ( TSE ) scans with variable flip angle ( T2w; voxel size 0 . 5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a00 . 5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a00 . 5 mm , TE\u00a0=\u00a03 . 51 ms , TR\u00a0=\u00a0100 ms , flip angle\u00a0=\u00a045\u00b0 , 128 slices ) within the same session . Scans of the same type were averaged for each monkey; the mean image of the T1w MPRAGE scans was then divided by the mean image of the T2w scans to create a T1w/T2w image , which we refer to as a T1w/T2 w \u2018myelin-weighted map\u2019 ( Glasser and Van Essen , 2011; Large et al . , 2016 ) . We acquired the diffusion-weighted imaging ( DWI ) data with a twice-refocused spin-echo ( TRSE ) sequence . The DWI dataset included six b\u00a0=\u00a00 s/mm2 and single shell with 60 gradient directions using b\u00a0=\u00a01000 s/mm2 . Whole-brain DWI volumes were collected at 1 mm x 1 mm x 1 mm resolution ( FOV\u00a0=\u00a0112 mm x 112 mm , image matrix 112 \u00d7 112 ) as 56 interleaved axial slices . For monkey S , TE\u00a0=\u00a0102 ms and TR\u00a0=\u00a09 s; for the controls , TE\u00a0=\u00a0102 ms and TR\u00a0=\u00a08 . 3 s . Each 60-direction , diffusion-weighted imaging ( DWI ) scan took 13 min , and was repeated 12 times in each monkey for subsequent averaging to improve SNR . Alternate sets of diffusion-weighted data were collected with the phase encode direction was reversed ( for monkey S , right-left and left-right reversal; for the controls , anterior-posterior and posterior-anterior reversal ) , so that six sets of each direction were collected . Alternating phase-encoded images for each animal were later combined to reduce susceptibility artefacts along the phase-encoding direction using \u2018Top-Up\u2019 ( Andersson et al . , 2003; Smith et al . , 2004 ) . fMRI data were acquired using a gradient-echo T2* echo planar imaging ( EPI ) sequence with 1 . 5 mm x 1 . 5 mm x 1 . 5 mm resolution , 32 ascending slices , TR\u00a0=\u00a02 . 00 s , TE\u00a0=\u00a029 ms , flip angle\u00a0=\u00a078 . A block was 30 s long , with stimulus and baseline conditions interleaved . We collected at least 32 min of functional data from each subject and each stimulus condition . Prior to scanning , the post mortem brains were removed from 4% paraformaldehyde and placed into phosphate-buffered saline for at least 72 hr , then they were placed in a sealed container into\u00a03SM Fluorinert Electronic Liquid FC3283 ( Acota Ltd ) . Post mortem brains were scanned on a whole-body Siemens 7T MRI scanner ( 28 channel knee coil - QED ) , where T2*-weighted images were acquired with seven 3D gradient-echo ( GRE ) scans ( voxel size 0 . 27 mm x 0 . 27 mm x 0 . 27 mm , TE\u00a0=\u00a018 ms , TR\u00a0=\u00a038 ms , flip angle\u00a0=\u00a015\u00b0 , 256 slices ) . A rigid body ( translation and rotation ) co-registration was performed between repeats using FSL FLIRT ( Jenkinson and Smith , 2001; Jenkinson et al . , 2002 ) prior to averaging and a Gibbs ringing correction was carried\u00a0out on the combined datasets ( Kellner et al . , 2016 ) . Visual presentations of high contrast stimuli ( black:white ca . 500:1 ) were back-projected onto a screen ( with resolution of 1280 \u00d7 1024 pixels subtending a visual field of 105\u00b0 x 75\u00b0 ) . The screen was placed at a distance of 19 cm centrally in front of the opened eyes of the monkey positioned in the sphinx-position in the scanner . Monkey S and six fMRI control monkeys were presented with checkerboard and visual motion stimuli ( of which monkey S and three controls showed visual responses in LGN to the checkerboard ) . Only Monkey S and four control animals were presented with the face stimuli . Checkerboard . The checkerboard stimulus was created from two inverted circular stimuli each divided into wedges with alternating contrasts ( Figure 12A ) . Both stimuli had a radial width of 320 by 256 pixels and angular distance of 45 degrees ( or radial frequency\u00a0=\u00a02 cycles and angular frequency\u00a0=\u00a08 cycles ) . Stimuli alternated at 1 . 6 Hz . The flickering checkerboard alternated with a mid-grey screen with a block length of 30 s . Each scan consisted of 16 repeats of this 60 s cycle , giving a length of 480 volumes . Two scans were run in the session . Masks for the lateral geniculate nucleus ( LGN ) , medial and lateral pulvinar , superior colliculus ( SC ) , area V5/MT and primary visual cortex ( V1 ) were defined anatomically on the brains of each individual monkey in structural space using a standard atlas as a guide ( National Institute of Mental Health Macaque Template - NMT ) ( Seidlitz et al . , 2018 ) . To control for the effects of anaesthesia , we included four monkeys for analysis of functional MRI data which showed significant LGN activation to the checkerboard stimulation ( z\u00a0>\u00a02 . 3 , not further corrected ) ( See Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . Block experiment analysis . The checkerboard and motion experiments followed the same analysis pipeline . In the checkerboard experiment , the flickering checkerboard was contrasted with a mid-grey screen , whereas in the motion experiment , moving dots were contrasted with stationary dots . Pre-processing and statistical analysis were performed using tools from the FSL toolbox ( FMRIB Software Library , http://www . fmrib . ox . ac . uk/fsl ) . Non-brain tissue was excluded from analysis using BET ( Brain Extraction Tool ) ( Smith , 2002 ) , motion correction was performed using MCFLIRT ( FMRIB Linear Image Restoration Tool with Motion Correction ) ( Jenkinson et al . , 2002; Jenkinson and Smith , 2001 ) . Spatial smoothing was applied using a full-width half-height Gaussian kernel of 3 mm and high pass temporal filtering ( Gaussian-weighted least-squares straight-line fitting ) was used . Functional images were registered to high-resolution structural scans using FLIRT . A general linear model ( GLM ) was used to contrast the presentation of the checkerboard or moving dots against the mid-grey or stationary dot background and data from the two stimulus runs were combined using a fixed effects analysis . Statistical maps were thresholded at a z-statistic of 2 . 3 , with no further correction . This relatively liberal threshold was chosen due to the anaesthesia reducing the BOLD signal in the monkeys , although our isoflurane levels were below those shown to induce significant resting network changes ( Hutchison et al . , 2014 ) . For the fMRI analyses , visual areas masks for LGN , pulvinar and V5/MT were transformed into EPI space and a region of interest analysis was performed by extracting the % BOLD change from each area using Featquery , another tool from the FSL toolbox . Timeseries shown for monkey S were extracted from one of the two scans obtained for each stimulus , specifically the one with the highest z-statistics , because signal modulation was likely to be noisy . Data were averaged across the 16 stimulus cycles to give a mean cycle of the timeseries . In the case of the LGN and pulvinar timeseries , the data were averaged across all voxels in the mask , rather than using peak voxels . In the case of the STS , the timeseries data were extracted from the region of activation ( z\u00a0>\u00a02 . 3 ) indicated by the arrow in the figure . Probabilistic tractography was performed using ProbtrackX2 from the FSL FDT toolbox ( Behrens et al . , 2007 ) . We traced two unilateral pathways in each hemisphere: pulvinar to V5/MT and LGN to V5/MT . Masks for these three structures were obtained from a standard atlas ( NMT ) ( Seidlitz et al . , 2018 ) and later modified by hand . The pulvinar mask was reduced in size to focus on the inferior pulvinar as this is the portion that relays visual information from the SC to area V5/MT ( Berman and Wurtz , 2010 ) . Anatomical masks used for tractography were further modified to eliminate potential overlap between masks for neighbouring subcortical regions . For example , the LGN and pulvinar masks were modified so that they were always separated by at least 1\u20132 coronal slices . We used exclusion masks to eliminate streamlines passing anterior of the LGN or across hemispheres . In the case of the V1-lesioned monkey S , we also included a mask encompassing the bilateral lesion . We modified the default parameters of ProbtrackX2 in order to optimise the procedure for NHP data , based on previous work in our lab ( Tang-Wright , 2016 ) . Specifically , we limited the streamline length to 100 steps , with step length of 0 . 5 mm . The value of each voxel represented the total number of streamline passing through . Each voxel was thresholded at 10% of the maximum number of streamlines found in any voxel . A recent study that directly compared diffusion tractography with tracers in monkeys reported that a threshold of 10% most reliably reflect the anatomy when compared with tracers ( Azadbakht et al . , 2015 ) .", "headings": ["Abstract", "Introduction", "Results", "Discussion", "Materials and methods"], "keywords": ["neuroscience"], "id": "elife-42325-v1"}
{"lay_summary": "The immune system defends us from attacks by viruses , bacteria and other microbes . One way that the immune system can identify these invaders is by detecting genetic material from the microbes . Like us , many of these microbes have genetic material made of a two-stranded molecule called DNA . A protein called IFI16 is an important sensor in immune cells that can bind to foreign DNA , but not to the DNA of the host . If the ability to discriminate between host and foreign DNA is lost , then immune cells start to attack the body\u2019s own tissues , which can lead to severe \u201cautoimmune\u201d diseases . However , it is not clear how IFI16 and other sensor proteins are able to tell foreign and host DNA apart . DNA in host cells is packaged in particular proteins to form structures called nucleosomes that can make it difficult for other proteins to bind to the DNA . When foreign DNA enters the cell , IFI16 promotes the formation of nucleosomes on these molecules , but the nucleosomes are further apart than those in host DNA , which leaves longer stretches of \u201cexposed\u201d DNA between the nucleosomes . In 2014 , a group of researchers reported that multiple molecules of IFI16 associate with each other and form clusters on exposed foreign DNA . Here , Stratmann , Morrone et al . \u2013 including some of the researchers from the earlier work \u2013 investigated how IFI16 selectively binds to foreign DNA using a combination of biochemical and single-molecule techniques . The experiments show that to start with , a few molecules of IFI16 bind to stretches of exposed foreign DNA and then move along the DNA strands . As more molecules of IFI16 bind to this DNA , they bump into each other and start to form clusters that eventually become immobile . Further experiments show that the more tightly packed nucleosomes in host DNA molecules act as a barrier to IFI16 cluster formation because they interfere with the ability of the protein to move along the DNA . Stratmann , Morrone et al . \u2019s findings show that IFI16 can only trigger immune responses when it binds to stretches of exposed DNA that are long enough to allow the assembly of IFI16 clusters . The next challenge will be to see whether other DNA sensors employ similar strategies to detect foreign DNA .", "article": "The ability to recognize foreign double-stranded ( ds ) DNA of pathogenic origin in the intracellular environment is an essential defense mechanism of the human innate immune system . However , the molecular mechanisms underlying distinction between foreign DNA and host genomic material inside the nucleus are not understood . By combining biochemical assays and single-molecule techniques , we show that the nuclear innate immune sensor IFI16 one-dimensionally tracks long stretches of exposed foreign dsDNA to assemble into supramolecular signaling platforms . We also demonstrate that nucleosomes represent barriers that prevent IFI16 from targeting host DNA by directly interfering with these one-dimensional movements . This unique scanning-assisted assembly mechanism allows IFI16 to distinguish friend from foe and assemble into oligomers efficiently and selectively on foreign DNA . \n The host innate immune system detects infection by directly recognizing molecular signatures associated with pathogens ( Janeway and Medzhitov , 2002; Medzhitov and Janeway , 2000 ) . Remarkably , such signatures include universal building blocks of all life , such as DNA and RNA ( Janeway and Medzhitov , 2002; Orzalli and Knipe , 2014; Paludan and Bowie , 2013 ) . In the cytoplasm , the immune system relies on the absence of endogenous DNA , and thus marks all detected DNA as 'foreign' ( nonself ) ( Orzalli and Knipe , 2014; Paludan and Bowie , 2013 ) . However , DNA viruses often evade the cytosolic detection machineries , as their genomes are not exposed until reaching the nucleus ( Orzalli and Knipe , 2014; Paludan and Bowie , 2013 ) . The host counters this infection strategy in the nucleus by directly assembling supramolecular signaling platforms that trigger inflammatory responses on invading foreign DNA , but not on its own genomic material ( Johnson et al . , 2013; Li et al . , 2012; Kerur et al . , 2011 ) . Although key players that target foreign dsDNA in the host nucleus have been identified ( Orzalli and Knipe , 2014; Paludan and Bowie , 2013 ) , the molecular mechanisms by which these sensors distinguish self from nonself dsDNA remain unknown . The interferon-inducible protein 16 ( IFI16 ) is a key innate immune sensor that detects foreign dsDNA and uses it as a scaffold to assemble supramolecular signaling platforms in both the host nucleus and cytoplasm ( Unterholzner et al . , 2010; Johnson et al . , 2013; Li et al . , 2012; Kerur et al . , 2011; Orzalli et al . , 2012 ) ( Figure 1A ) . IFI16 plays a central role in defense against a number of pathogens ( e . g herpes simplex virus-1 ) ( Unterholzner et al . , 2010; Johnson et al . , 2013; Li et al . , 2012; Kerur et al . , 2011; Orzalli et al . , 2012 ) . On the other hand , persistent IFI16 signaling is associated with autoimmunity ( e . g . Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome ) ( Mondini et al . , 2007; Choubey et al . , 2010; Mondini et al . , 2010; Gugliesi et al . , 2013; Smith and Jefferies , 2014 ) . The molecular mechanisms by which IFI16 selectively targets foreign dsDNA remain unknown . To establish a functional signaling platform , IFI16 must overcome two challenges . First , individual IFI16 molecules must be able to locate one another on large pathogen genomes with sizes ranging from 105 to 106 base pairs ( bps ) . Second and more importantly , this assembly mechanism can only take place on foreign dsDNA and must be inhibited on host dsDNA ( Figure 1A ) . Here , we report the observation of a unifying molecular mechanism that explains how IFI16 resolves these central issues in initiating its foreign-dsDNA sensing pathways . 10 . 7554/eLife . 11721 . 003Figure 1 . IFI16 assembles faster on longer dsDNA . ( A ) Top: IFI16 is composed of three functional domains flanked by unstructured linkers , namely one pyrin domain ( PYD ) and two dsDNA-binding Hin domains ( HinA and HinB; Hin: hematopoietic interferon-inducible nuclear antigen ) . Bottom: IFI16 detects foreign dsDNA from invading pathogens in both the\u00a0host nucleus and cytoplasm . ( B ) Top: a cartoon scheme for FRET experiments . The two differentially colored ovals represent fluorescently ( Dylight-550 and Dylight-650 ) labeled IFI16 . Bottom: The time-dependent changes in the emission ratio between FRET donor and acceptor labeled IFI16 ( 50 nM ) were monitored at 33 \u00b5g/ml of each dsDNA ( e . g . sixfold higher than the dissociation constant for 39-bp dsDNA [Morrone et al . , 2014] ) . Lines are fits to a first-order exponential equation ( see Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1 for 25 nM protein ) . All shown representative experiments were performed at least three times . ( C ) A plot of observed assembly rates ( kassms ) vs . dsDNA-sizes ( see also\u00a0Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . ( D ) 1D-diffusion assisted assembly mechanism can explain the observed assembly profile of IFI16 . 1 . At the same mass-concentrations , the number of individual dsDNA fragments present in each assay is inversely proportional to the length of dsDNA . 2 . Individual IFI16 molecules initially bind dsDNA at random positions and diffuse one-dimensionally while searching for other respective protomers; the number of IFI16 residing on the same dsDNA fragment should be proportional to the length of dsDNA ( e . g . there are four times more individual 150-bp fragments than 600-bp fragments ) 3 . IFI16 fails to assemble into an oligomer on dsDNA shorter than 60 bp ( indicated by a red arrow pointing left ) . The saturating rates can be explained if the final FRET signals arise from formation of distinct optimal oligomers .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 11721 . 005 \n To identify the mechanisms underlying assembly of IFI16 signaling platforms on DNA , we monitored the oligomerization kinetics of FRET donor and acceptor labeled IFI16 on naked dsDNA ( FRET: fluorescence resonance energy transfer; Figure 1B and Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . Previous work demonstrated the existence of such oligomers and reported on their equilibrium binding properties but did not provide insights into the assembly mechanisms ( Morrone et al . , 2014 ) . Using various dsDNA fragment sizes present in excess , we observe that the assembly rate increased non-linearly and by 50-fold from 60 to 200 bps dsDNA , above which it stayed constant ( up to 600 bps; Figure 1B , C ) . With a dsDNA-binding footprint of ~15 bp for one IFI16 ( Morrone et al . , 2014 ) , our results indicate that about 4 copies are required to initiate assembly , and about 10 IFI16 molecules are required for optimal oligomeric assembly ( Figure 1C ) . Further , the assembly rate constants scaled linearly with the IFI16 concentration for all measured DNA lengths ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1 and Supplementary file 1A ) , indicating that a purely cooperative assembly mechanism is unlikely . In line with this observation , previous work reported relatively small contributions of cooperativity in oligomerization with Hill constants near 2 for DNA substrates up to 2000 bp ( Morrone et al . , 2014 ) . Our ensemble-averaged , solution-phase observations of the faster assembly on longer dsDNA suggest a model in which IFI16 scans along dsDNA to increase the probability of encountering other IFI16 molecules ( Figure 1D ) . To directly test such a mechanism , we used single-molecule fluorescence imaging to track the movements of individual Cy5-labeled IFI16 molecules on stretched , double-sided attached \u03bb-phage dsDNA ( \u03bbdsDNA; 48 . 5 kbps ) ( Figure 2A and Video 1 ) . Figure 2B shows that individual IFI16 molecules one-dimensionally ( 1D ) diffuse on \u03bbdsDNA while bound for several seconds . The diffusion coefficient of IFI16 increased with ionic strength , indicating that IFI16 does not maintain a continuous electrostatic interaction with the dsDNA backbone , but instead moves along the \u03bbdsDNA scaffold by executing microscopically small steps ( Blainey et al . , 2006 ) ( Figure 2B and Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . An IFI16 construct lacking the oligomerizing pyrin domain ( PYD ) ( IFI16HinAB; see also Figure 1A ) showed similar diffusional properties , suggesting that the dsDNA-binding HIN200 domains are responsible for 1D diffusion . Upon applying higher concentrations of IFI16 with a constant supply of proteins into our flow cell , we observed a gradual formation of distinct , immobile clusters along \u03bbdsDNA ( Figure 2C , Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2 , and Video 2 ) . Over time , we also observed an increase in the number of molecules per cluster and a concomitant decrease in the diffusion coefficient ( Figures 2C , D ) . We analyzed the impact of flow on the diffusion coefficient and diffusion bias and found it to be not significant for cluster formation ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4 ) . Single-molecule intensity analysis revealed that the lower limit of the number of IFI16 molecules found in immobile clusters is equivalent to eight protomers ( Figure 2D and Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3 ) , which also corroborate the optimal complex ( ten protomers ) suggested from Figure 1C . Furthermore , individual IFI16 molecules either formed new clusters or joined other clusters in a stochastic manner , and the immobile clusters formed faster with higher IFI16 concentrations ( Figure 2E ) . The rate of addition of IFI16 molecules to clusters is independent on the size of the existing cluster , confirming the absence of strong cooperativity in assembly ( Figure 2C; bottom panel ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 11721 . 006Figure 2 .

( Left ) Representative fluorescence images of IFI16-Cy5 on DNA molecules: Concentrations of 1 and 5 nM result in the resolution of single IFI16 molecules and distinguishable Ifi16 clusters , respectively , whereas a higher concentration of 10 nM eventually leads to DNA congestion with protein clusters or filaments . ( Right ) Intensities per particle are shown for 1 nM ( single molecules ) and 5 nM ( clusters of IFI16 ) .

Fluorescence data of 5 nM IFI16 are converted to cluster sizes ( see Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . The mean cluster size amounts to 8 IFI16 molecules within a cluster .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 11721 . 011 The 1D diffusion of IFI16 on dsDNA explains why the assembly rates increase with the DNA length in the bulk experiments ( Figure 1C ) . With the longer dsDNA acting as an antenna , it allows binding of more IFI16 while 1D diffusion facilitates dynamic association ( Figure 1D ) . The saturation of the assembly rate ( Figure 1C ) can be explained by the square dependence of the diffusional search time on length: at a sufficiently long dsDNA length , the dissociation rate of an individual IFI16 will be faster than the time needed to scan along the entire length of the DNA . In addition , longer DNA substrates work no longer as antennae , but as traps , since individual IFI16 molecules are farther apart and thus less likely to encounter one another ( Hu et al . , 2006; Turkin et al . , 2015; 2016 ) . Overall , the results of our bulk and single-molecule experiments are consistent with the dsDNA-size dependent binding in\u00a0vitro ( Morrone et al . , 2014 ) , which also correlates with the IFI16-induced inflammatory responses in\u00a0vivo ( Unterholzner et al . , 2010 ) . Thus , we propose that the 1D-diffusion mediated assembly plays a key role in regulating the overall IFI16-mediated immune responses . It has long been speculated that chromatinization acts as the key feature that allows IFI16 to distinguish host from foreign DNA in the nucleus ( Kerur et al . , 2011; Unterholzner and Bowie , 2011; Li et al . , 2012; Orzalli et al . , 2012; 2013; Johnson et at . , 2014 ) ; IFI16 oligomerizes on exposed invading foreign-dsDNA before it becomes hetero-chromatinized . Previous in\u00a0vivo work demonstrated that transfected chromatinized SV40 DNA is able to evade IFI16 oligomerization and downstream responses ( Orzalli et al . , 2013 ) . Nevertheless , the molecular mechanism by which IFI16 could use chromatinization to distinguish self from nonself has yet to be identified . To directly address this issue , we first used a competition-binding assay to investigate how IFI16 interacts with dsDNA fragments containing two nucleosomes with varying spacer sizes ( 6 , 30 , 50 , and 70 bps; Figure 3A and Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . Here , di-nucleosomes with 6- , 30- , and 50-bp spacer failed to compete against IFI16-bound FAM-labeled 70-bp dsDNA , ( Figure 3B ) . On the other hand , the di-nucleosome with 70-bp spacer competed similarly as 70-bp naked dsDNA , but significantly more weakly than naked 300-bp dsDNA ( Figure 3B ) . In FRET assembly assays , di-nucleosomes with spacers shorter than 70-bp failed to support assembly ( Figure 3C ) , consistent with our FRET kinetics assays using naked dsDNA ( Figure 1B ) . The 70-bp spacer di-nucleosome supported oligomerization of IFI16; however , the assembly kinetics was again similar to that of naked 70-bp dsDNA , but not that of naked 300-bp dsDNA ( Figure 3C ) . Taken together , these results show that efficient IFI16 cluster formation requires a minimal length of 50-70 base pairs of exposed dsDNA . Considering that the size of dsDNA linker between two nucleosomes is about 20 to 30 bps in mammals ( McGhee et al . , 1983 ) , these results directly support the hypothesis that chromatinization is a key deterrent for preventing the assembly of IFI16 signaling platforms on self-dsDNA . 10 . 7554/eLife . 11721 . 012Figure 3 . Nucleosomes inhibit oligomerization . ( A ) A cartoon of di-nucleosome constructs with varying dsDNA-spacers .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 11721 . 013 To test whether the inhibitory effect of chromatin directly arises by interfering with the 1D diffusion of IFI16 , we visualized the movement of individual IFI16 molecules on DNA with nucleosomes . We introduced randomly localized nucleosomes in \u03bbdsDNA using recombinant human histone octamers and tagged nucleosome positions with fluorescent antibodies against the N-terminal tail of histone H4 ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . The application of hydrodynamic flow resulted in the single IFI16 molecules being pushed to one direction and clustering at nucleosomal sites on \u03bbdsDNA , unable to overcome the octamers by diffusion ( Figure 4A , Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2 , and Video 3 ) . Without the antibody , the motion of IFI16 was still confined , whereas for bare \u03bbdsDNA , IFI16 moved with a high processivity along the entire strand ( Figures 4B , C , and Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3 ) . These observations are consistent with the bulk experiments ( Figure 3 ) , and confirm that nucleosomes directly restrict the 1D diffusion of IFI16 and consequently limit the assembly of IFI16 signaling platforms on dsDNA . 10 . 7554/eLife . 11721 . 014Figure 4 . Nucleosomes inhibit 1D-diffusion . ( A ) Kymographs of Cy5-labeled IFI16 ( magenta ) binding to \u03bbdsDNA with varying numbers of nucleosomes tagged with anti-H4-Atto488 ( blue ) . The number of nucleosomes per \u03bbdsDNA were estimated by quantifying IFI16 clustering sites for the lowest nucleosome/\u03bbdsDNA ratio ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3C ) , yielding ~2 nucleosomes/ \u03bbdsDNA . At low nucleosome concentrations ( ~2 to 6 nucleosomes/DNA ) , IFI16 binds to \u03bbdsDNA and diffuses with the flow direction , until encountering a nucleosome . At higher concentrations ( ~20 nucleosomes per \u03bbdsDNA ) , individual IFI16 show only very short diffusive movements upon binding . ( B ) On naked \u03bbdsDNA , IFI16 travels with the flow to the free tip ( top ) , whereas it oligomerizes along the path on nucleosome-loaded \u03bbdsDNA ( bottom ) . ( C ) The overall travel distance of single IFI16 on nucleosome-loaded \u03bbdsDNA is reduced compared to bare \u03bbdsDNA ( nucleosomal \u03bbdsDNA: N\u00a0=\u00a0167 , bare \u03bbdsDNA: N\u00a0=\u00a0141 ) .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 11721 . 018 The molecular mechanism by which innate immune sensors distinguish self from foreign dsDNA in the host nucleus has been a major unresolved question in innate immunology ( Kerur et al . , 2011; Unterholzner and Bowie , 2011; Li et al . , 2012; 2013; Orzalli et al . , 2012; 2013; Johnson et al . , 2014 ) . The oligomerization of IFI16 on under-chromatinized foreign DNA plays a key role not only in initiating inflammatory and antiviral responses , ( Monroe et al . , 2014; Orzalli et al . , 2012; Kerur et al . , 2011 ) , but also in regulating the hetero-chromatinization and silencing of viral dsDNA ( Johnson et al . , 2014; Orzalli et al . , 2013 ) . By using time-resolved bulk and single-molecule fluorescence assays , we demonstrate here that IFI16 ID scans along exposed dsDNA to assemble into distinct clusters and that chromatinization is sufficient to inhibit IFI16 from targeting host dsDNA for assembly . In\u00a0vivo , this 1D scanning mechanism allows a limited number of IFI16 molecules to allocate each other on large genomes of invading pathogens . In combination with 3D sampling of binding sites on a collapsed DNA molecule , this process optimizes the oligomerization and downstream signaling time . While the clustering on dsDNA presents a tempting explanation for the role of IFI16 in viral gene silencing , future in\u00a0vivo experiments await to test this . IFI16 belongs to the family of AIM2-like receptors , which include other nuclear and cytosolic foreign dsDNA-sensors . It will be interesting to determine whether and how these other related sensors use exposed dsDNA as a 1D 'digital ruler' to regulate their signaling platform assembly . This family of sensors is implicated in a number of autoimmune disorders ( Mondini et al . , 2007; 2010; Choubey et al . , 2010; Gugliesi et al . , 2013; Smith and Jefferies , 2014 ) ; how regulation of assembly is disrupted may provide insights into these afflictions . \n Human full-length IFI16 and IFI16HinAB were cloned and expressed using E . coli T7 express cells ( NEB ) as a C-terminally His6-tagged protein as described in Morrone et al . ( Morrone et al . , 2014 ) . dsDNA shorter than 90-bp were obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies ( IDT ) as described in Morrone et al . ( Morrone et al . , 2014 ) . The complementary strands were dissolved and mixed in 1:1 molar ratio , melted at 95\u00b0C for 10\u00a0min , and the temperature was lowered to 25\u00b0C at a rate of 1\u00b0C/min . Ligands of greater length were obtained by polymerase-chain reaction ( PCR ) using the Maltose Binding Protein fusion tag cloning sequence as template and primers of appropriate sequence for a final length as indicated in the paper . Plasmids containing the Widom-601/603 sequence with indicated linker lengths were a kind gift of Dr . Gregory Bowman . The nucleosomal DNA was obtained by PCR from these constructs with appropriate primers . All substrates were gel-purified . DyLight-550 , DyLight-650 , or Cy5 fluorophore was incorporated to IFI16 using maleimide chemistry ( purchased from Thermo Scientific and Invitrogen ) and was performed as described in Morrone , et al . ( Morrone et al . , 2014 ) . The label to protein ratio was ~ 1:1 . Fluorescein-labeled dsDNA72 was obtained from IDT . Lyophylized Xenopus laevis histones H1A , H2A , H3 , and H4 were a kind gift of Dr . Cynthia Wolberger . Octamer refolding and nucleosome reconstitution was performed as described in Luger et al . ( Luger et al . , 1999 ) , at a 2:1 molar ratio of octamer:DNA . An agarose gel of reconstituted nucleosomes is shown in Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1 . All absorption , fluorescence anisotropy , and fluorescence excitation/emission experiments were performed in a Tecan Infinite M1000 . All experiments were performed at least three times and the fits to data were generated by Kaleidagraph software ( synergy ) . All reactions were performed in 40\u00a0mM HEPES pH 7 . 4 , 160\u00a0mM KCl , 5% glycerol , 1\u00a0mM EDTA , 0 . 1% triton-X-100 , 5\u00a0mM DTT ( Reaction Buffer ) . Here , 300\u00a0nM IFI16 and 4 . 5nM fluorescein-labeled dsVACV72 were incubated together at room temperature for 20\u00a0min . Increasing concentrations of competing DNA were added to the reaction to a final concentration of 100\u00a0nM IFI16 and 1 . 5\u00a0nM dsVACV72 , and the changes in fluorescence anisotropy were recorded as indicated in Morrone et al . ( Morrone et al . , 2014 ) . All reactions were performed in reaction buffer . 66 \u00b5g/ml of each dsDNA or di-nucleosomes was placed in the plate wells , and the reaction was initiated by adding an equivalent volume of IFI16-550 and IFI16-650 ( 1:1 molar ratio ) to the indicated final concentration . The dead time between addition of IFI16 and the first measurement was 15-20\u00a0s . The final dsDNA molar-concentrations are at least sixfold higher than their determined binding constants by fluorescence anisotropy assays described in Morrone , et al . ( Morrone et al . , 2014 ) , and the FRET ratio for each time point was calculated by dividing the acceptor emission ( 678 nm ) by the donor emission ( 574 nm ) ( Morrone et al . , 2014 ) . Microscope coverslips ( Corning ) were plasma-cleaned and activated with 100 mM KOH , silanized with 3-Aminopropyl-triethoxysilane in acetone and functionalized with PEG-NHS and biotin-PEG-NHS ( Laysan-Bio ) in sodium bicarbonate with a 1:3 mass ratio ( Tanner and van Oijen , 2010 ) . Streptavidin ( Sigma Aldrich ) was used for anchoring the biotinylated DNA substrates to the coverslip surface . Flow channels were constructed with custom-made PDMS chips to obtain dimensions of 10 mm length , 100 \u00b5m height , and 1 mm width , and connected to a syringe pump to allow constant flow during the measurements . Single-molecule assays were performed in 40 mM HEPES ( pH 7 . 4 ) , 160 mM KCl , 1 mM EDTA , 2 mM DTT , 10% glycerol , 0 . 1% Triton-X100 , 250 \u00b5g/ml BSA , 1 mM Trolox , 40 mM glucose , 250 nM glucose oxidase , 60 nM catalase , unless otherwise stated . All assays were performed at room temperature . We applied 100 nM YoPro-1 iodide ( Life Technologies ) at the end of the measurements to visualize the DNA substrates . Reactions were illuminated with a 488-nm and 641-nm laser ( Coherent ) , and images were acquired with an EMCCD camera ( Hamamatsu ) . We used MetaVue imaging software ( Molecular Devices ) for data acquisition and ImageJ and R for analysis . Lambda-DNA ( New England Biolabs ) was biotinylated at one or both ends by ligation of the respective complementary biotinylated oligos according to Tanner et al . ( Tanner and van Oijen , 2010 ) ( oligo sequences are given in Supplementary file 1B; purchased from IDT ) . Single-biotinylated DNA templates were stretched by constant flow ( 20 \u00b5l/min ) throughout the experiments ( IFI16 clustering and nucleosome assays ) . Double-biotinylated DNA templates were applied to the flow cell at high flow velocity ( 100 \u00b5l/min ) . This allowed binding of the DNA to two biotin moieties , while the DNA was stretched . Free DNA was washed out , IFI16 applied to the flow cell , and flow was then stopped for acquisition of the single molecule diffusion traces . To reconstitute nucleosomes , recombinant histone H2A/H2B dimers and H3/H4 tetramers ( New England Biolabs ) were assembled on biotin-\u03bb-DNA and biotin-601 sequence ( Epicypher ) by salt-gradient dialysis ( 2 M to 0 . 3 mM NaCl in 5 steps , each step with an incubation time of at least 2 hr ) in 10 mM Tris/HCl , pH 7 . 4 , 0 . 1 mM EDTA , 0 . 5 mM DTT . We tested nucleosome reconstitution by an EMSA assay on digested \u03bb-DNA ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . For this , we generated DNA fragments by digestion with EcoRI ( NEB ) , purified them ( Qiagen DNA spin columns ) and reconstituted nucleosomes in the concentration ratios that we also used for full-length \u03bb-DNA . Antibodies against human histone H4 and H2B were chosen to target the N- terminal histone tails ( Santa Cruz , sc-8657 and sc-8650 ) , and labeled with Atto488-NHS ( Life technologies ) in PBS at pH 7 . 0 . Labeled antibodies were negatively tested against bare DNA and Ifi16 clusters in the microscopy assay , and showed high specificity for nucleosomal DNA preparations only . \u03bb-DNA templates , loaded with nucleosomes and tagged with anti-H4 , were constantly stretched in the flow channel . Ifi16 co-localized strongly with the nucleosome signal ( Video 3 , Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . In contrast , biotinylated 601-sequence prepared with nucleosomes and tagged with anti-H4-Atto488 , hardly showed co-localization with Ifi16 , indicating , that there is not sufficient exposed dsDNA available for binding ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . For the clustering experiments , we applied a flow of 0 . 02 ml/min to our flow cell design of 0 . 1 mm height and 1 mm width , giving a volumetric flux of 0 . 33 cm/s . We expect the DNA molecules to be on average 0 . 2 \u00b5m away from the surface ( Tafvizi et al . , 2008 ) , giving a velocity at this distance y of ( Tafvizi et al . , 2011 ) :vy=32vavghy-y2h24=40\u00a0\u03bcm/s , with vavg=23vmax The Stokes drag force that acts on the DNA and bound IFI16 molecules is then described by\u00a0F=6\u03c0\u03b7rv1+9r16y=1 . 5fN , with viscosity \u03b7 , radius r and distance y . We can define this force within the diffusion coefficient D by using the drift velocity v , calculated from single-molecule trajectories ( Leith et al . , 2012 ) :with\u00a0v=\u2211jall\u00a0traj . xj , final-xj , initial\u2211jall\u00a0traj . tj , final-xj , initial\u22480 . 127\u00a0\u03bcm/s . In order to evaluate the effect of flow on the clustering mechanism , we implemented a 1D-random walk Monte-Carlo simulation ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4 ) . Here , we calculated the expected search time for two IFI16 molecules ( with D=0 . 026 \u00b5m2/s ) to allocate each other on a \u03bb-DNA molecule congested with a varying amount of other diffusing IFI16 molecules ( 10 , 50 , 100 molecules ) . As all particles are equal , we segmented the DNA according to the total number of molecules bound and calculated the effective distance between two particles by using the absolute distance modulo the segment length in order to take the periodic boundaries into account . We allowed a maximum distance of 10 nm to consider two particles having met and dimerized . To simulate flow similar to our experimental conditions , to each random step the term vdt was added ( The Python code is found in Source code 1 ) .", "headings": ["Abstract", "Introduction", "Results\u00a0and\u00a0discussion", "Materials and methods"], "keywords": ["short report", "immunology and inflammation"], "id": "elife-11721-v2"}
{"lay_summary": "Neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease affect millions of people worldwide . In many of these diseases , toxic proteins accumulate in the brain and build up as small \u2018plaques\u2019 in the gaps , or synapses , that cells called neurons communicate across . Eventually , the plaques prevent the neurons signaling to each other correctly , leading to problems such as memory loss . Identifying the proteins present in plaques is technically challenging , partly because the plaques are very small . Hadley , Rakhit et al . have now developed a new method called spatially targeted optical microproteomics ( or STOMP ) that can collect proteins from small areas of cells . In this method , plaques are identified under a light microscope , and their contents are attached to a molecule called a photo-affinity tag using lasers . The photo-tagged proteins are then pulled out using beads that specifically bind to the photo-affinity tag . The proteins can then be identified using a well-established method called mass spectrometry . Hadley , Rakhit et al . used STOMP to analyze plaques present in the brains of mice that develop similar symptoms to those seen in humans with Alzheimer's disease . This revealed that these plaques contain more than 50 different proteins , some of which had not previously been found in plaques . In particular , several proteins from the \u2018presynaptic\u2019 neuron that sends signals across the synapse were found in the plaques . However , no proteins from the receiving ( \u2018postsynaptic\u2019 ) neuron on the other side of the synapse were present in the plaque . Fixed human brain tissue is more difficult to analyze than mouse samples because it is modified for storage . In spite of these issues , Hadley , Rakhit et al . successfully also used STOMP to identify the proteins in human plaques . STOMP can be used to identify the proteins present in any area of a cell and thus has the potential to be widely used by scientists , not just those studying plaques .", "article": "Spatially targeted optical microproteomics ( STOMP ) is a novel proteomics technique for interrogating micron-scale regions of interest ( ROIs ) in mammalian tissue , with no requirement for genetic manipulation . Methanol or formalin-fixed specimens are stained with fluorescent dyes or antibodies to visualize ROIs , then soaked in solutions containing the photo-tag: 4-benzoylbenzyl-glycyl-hexahistidine . Confocal imaging along with two photon excitation are used to covalently couple photo-tags to all proteins within each ROI , to a resolution of 0 . 67 \u00b5m in the xy-plane and 1 . 48 \u00b5m axially . After tissue solubilization , photo-tagged proteins are isolated and identified by mass spectrometry . As a test case , we examined amyloid plaques in an Alzheimer's disease ( AD ) mouse model and a post-mortem AD case , confirming known plaque constituents and discovering new ones . STOMP can be applied to various biological samples including cell lines , primary cell cultures , ex vivo specimens , biopsy samples , and fixed post-mortem tissue . \n Pathological protein deposits have a long history as hallmarks of neurodegenerative disease . Early methods used to identify these deposits include the silver stain introduced by Golgi ( 1873 ) , and Virchow's iodine\u2013sulfuric acid stain for starch ( Virchow , 1854 ) that led to the coining of the term amyloid ( Virchow , 1855 ) . More specialized stains and labels have emerged which have begun to probe the structure and composition of pathological protein deposits . The stains Congo red and thioflavin S ( ThS ) were discovered later and remain in use ( reviewed by Westermark ( Sipe and Westermark , 2005 ) and Tanskanen ( Tanskanen , 2013 ) ) , specifically identifying deposits containing a particular structural motif: amyloid \u03b2-pleated sheets . Beyond mere detection lies comprehensive identification of the protein components of these deposits; biochemical analyses of the deposits have produced transformative results in the field of neurodegeneration research . Two classic examples include the discovery of the prion protein and formulation of the protein-only hypothesis of prion disease ( Bolton et al . , 1982 ) , and the discovery of the Alzheimer amyloid peptide ( A\u03b2 ) ( Glenner and Wong , 1984 ) and formulation of the amyloid cascade hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease ( AD , reviewed by Musiek and Holtzman ( Musiek and Holtzman , 2015 ) ) . More recently , there was the discovery that the RNA/DNA binding protein TDP-43 ( transactive response DNA binding protein 43 kDa ) is a significant component of ubiquitin-positive intraneuronal inclusions in certain cases of frontotemporal dementia ( FTD ) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS ) ( Neumann et al . , 2006 ) . This discovery helped establish these diseases as spectrum disorders ( Mackenzie , 2007 ) , it led to the identification of TDP-43 mutations that are causative for ALS and FTD ( Sreedharan et al . , 2008 ) and established a role for RNA metabolism in ALS/FTD pathogenesis ( Lagier-Tourenne and Cleveland , 2009; Mackenzie et al . , 2010 ) . Identification of the protein components of pathological deposits has traditionally involved the partial biochemical purification of detergent-insoluble proteins present in a tissue specimen followed by protein sequencing . Immunohistochemical methods are then used to confirm that the identified proteins are bona fide constituents of the pathological deposits . These methods require large amounts of sometimes-scarce pathological tissue and identification of novel protein components can require increasingly elaborate , time-consuming , and costly protocols . For example , the discovery of TDP-43 in ubiquitin-positive intraneuronal inclusions required the generation of \u223c1000 monoclonal antibodies , which were used to screen thousands of tissue sections by immunohistochemistry , to obtain a single monoclonal antibody that specifically labeled ubiquitin-positive intraneuronal inclusions ( Neumann et al . , 2006 ) . That antibody was used for the proteomic identification of TDP-43 from the detergent-insoluble fraction of pathological tissue homogenates , and confirmatory staining with commercial TDP-43 antibodies was required for validation . In addition to being costly and labor intensive , another major limitation of biochemical purification of protein deposits is that soluble protein components associated with the core aggregates are likely to be lost during fractionation . Identifying deposit-associated soluble proteins could further our understanding of disease mechanisms . A different strategy that can preserve some of the deposit-associated soluble proteins is laser capture microdissection ( LCM ) , in which protein deposits are lifted intact out of sections of the fixed specimen; their protein compositions are then determined by mass spectrometry ( Gozal et al . , 2006 ) . The resolution of LCM is \u223c10 \u00b5m in the horizontal plane and captures the entire thickness of the tissue section along the vertical axis . Thus , for features smaller than \u223c10 \u00b5m\u2014such as inclusion bodies , small amyloid plaques , narrow fibers , and other irregularly shaped structures\u2014LCM analysis permits enrichment but not complete isolation of target proteins; samples are diluted with extraneous surrounding material . For example , when capturing even a relatively large\u20143 \u03bcm in diameter\u2014inclusion body with a single 10 \u00b5m LCM spot , only \u223c10% of the recovered protein is from the pathology and 90% from the surrounding cellular milieu . LCM has nevertheless proven useful , however , in the proteomic analysis of systemic amyloidosis , where the amyloid deposits are very large and the feature size is typically \u223c50 , 000 \u03bcm2 in area ( Sethi et al . , 2012 , 2013 ) . Mass spectrometry imaging and its variants can also provide spatially resolved mass spectrometry analysis by directly coupling imaging with laser ablation and achieving 1 mm\u201310 \u03bcm resolution ( Stoeckli et al . , 2001; Wiseman et al . , 2006; Wucher et al . , 2007 ) , but it is usually used to look for specific targets rather than in discovery mode . Recently , proximity labeling techniques such as Bio-ID and APEX have provided high spatial resolution to mass spectrometry , and these techniques have been used to elucidate the composition of several difficult to purify organelles ( Roux et al . , 2012; Rhee et al . , 2013; Firat-Karalar et al . , 2014; Hung et al . , 2014 ) . However , proximity labeling relies on genetic manipulations to express an exogenous fusion protein to label adjacent components; this protein must be specifically and accurately targeted into a particular biological structure . Imperfect localization , especially in rare structures , results in selective labeling of neighbors outside of the target region yielding false positive associations . Many of these approaches have been brought to bear on amyloid ( senile ) plaques in AD brain tissue , in an attempt to identify core components , if any , in addition to A\u03b2 . Early LCM studies utilizing 2D gel electrophoresis coupled with mass spectrometry have detected a modest number of plaque-associated proteins , including an assortment of proteins associated with cell signaling , chaperone function , membrane trafficking , and proteolysis ( Liao et al . , 2004 ) . A more recent LCM study has suggested that amyloid plaques in AD are highly homogenous structures that are composed almost exclusively of A\u03b2 ( S\u00f6derberg et al . , 2006 ) . The latter study , however , employed sample washing steps with 1% SDS , which may strip away soluble plaque-associated proteins . Finally , a recent attempt to capture more plaque-associated proteins potentially lost to LCM examined the sarkosyl-insoluble fraction of brain samples from patients with AD and appropriate controls ( Gozal et al . , 2009 ) . Altered levels of eleven specific proteins were identified by this approach but colocalization with amyloid plaques was difficult to validate in many cases\u2014not all insoluble proteins within the brain will necessarily originate from senile plaques . A recent proteomic analysis of fractions obtained from differential centrifugation procedures that yield fractions enriched in post-synaptic proteins have demonstrated that the post-synaptic protein IRSp53 was highly down-regulated in AD ( Zhou et al . , 2013 ) . While extant LCM and biochemical fractionation studies have identified candidate plaque-associated proteins , significant mechanistic insights have not been produced . We have developed a semi-automated technique called spatially targeted optical microproteomics ( STOMP ) , which combines two-photon laser scanning microscopy with photochemical affinity labeling and mass spectrometry . While two-photon excitation has previously been used to drive microscopic , 3D-resolved photochemistry ( Lee et al . , 2008 ) , STOMP represents the first application of this technique to affinity photolabeling , offering single-micron-scale three-dimensional resolution that is an order of magnitude better than the current state of the art LCM . In addition to providing clues to the etiology of neurodegenerative disease , this new proteomic technique also has great potential to advance research in cell biology by yielding the composition of small features that are not amenable to biochemical purification . We sought to create an unbiased discovery technique that would: ( 1 ) have high spatial resolution , ( 2 ) target any identifiable or user-defined spatial region in a biological sample , ( 3 ) forgo the need for genetic modification , ( 4 ) have sufficient sensitivity to detect minor species within the sample , and ( 5 ) have sufficient specificity such that most hits can be readily validated as being enriched in the biological structure of interest . Because STOMP does not require genetic manipulation , this technique is applicable to a large variety of biological samples that run the gamut from cell lines , primary cell cultures , ex vivo specimens , human biopsy samples to fixed post-mortem human tissue . \n In STOMP , laser light from the microscope is used not only to image the fluorescently stained specimen , but also to photochemically crosslink affinity purification ligands to protein components within pathological deposits ( Figure 1A ) . The photo-affinity ligand or photo-tag used here is a peptide of sequence: 4-benzoylbenzyl-Gly-His-His-His-His-His-His-CONH2 ( 6HisBP ) ( Figure 1B ) . Benzoylbenzene is a photoreactive group that forms covalent bonds with C\u2013H and N\u2013H groups upon excitation . The 6HisBP photo-tag molecule ( molecular mass , 1105 Da ) is of similar size to Congo red ( molecular mass , 697 Da ) and should have a similar ability to penetrate biological specimens . The specimen is fixed and permeabilized in methanol , then protein deposits in the specimen are selectively stained using antibodies or specific fluorescent dyes . The specimen is then soaked in a solution of 6HisBP to saturate the subcellular compartments with the photo-tag , and imaged using conventional confocal microscopy . The wavelength of the confocal laser is in the visible range and does not excite the UV-absorbing photo-tag . Optical sectioning by confocal microscopy is used to collect a 3D image of the protein deposits in the specimen . This image in turn is used to generate a list of spatial coordinates\u2014a \u2018mask\u2019 file\u2014identifying every point in the tissue containing pathological protein deposits ( Figure 1C ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 09579 . 003Figure 1 . Overview of STOMP technology . ( A ) Schematic diagram comparing volumes selected for excision by laser capture microdissection ( LCM ) ( yellow cylinder ) and spatially targeted optical microproteomics ( STOMP ) ( blue volume ) . The STOMP excitation volume is limited approximately to the point spread function of a high numerical aperture lens ( <1 \u00b5m in the xy plane , \u223c1 . 0 \u00b5m axially ) compared to \u223c10 \u00b5m for LCM .

( 3 ) Two-photon laser selectively illuminates region of interest . The final image shown is anti-His tag immunofluorescence corresponding to areas of photo-tag crosslinking . ( D ) Silver stain of SDS-PAGE of material retrieved from selective STOMP of CRND8 mouse plaques ( left panel ) or non-plaque regions of an adjacent brain section ( right panel ) . In each case the control ( \u2018con\u2019 ) is non-specific binding to Ni2+-NTA agarose beads . Load is 1% of total protein after solubilization of tissue . Note that the predominant protein photo-tagged in the STOMP sample is A\u03b2 ( arrow ) , which is not visible in the non-plaque experiment because of its low overall abundance . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 09579 . 003 The photo-tagging procedure uses two-photon microscopy ( Skoch et al . , 2006 ) rather than conventional confocal microscopy . Two-photon microscopy can excite a small volume ( <1 \u00b5m3 , Figures 1A and Figure 2 ) anywhere in the specimen , while conventional confocal microscopy excites a continuous cone that spans the entire thickness of the specimen , which would result in the covalent attachment of the photo-tag to off-target regions . A custom software macro was written that reads the mask file and selectively delivers two-photon excitation light to each protein deposit present , while leaving the remainder of the specimen untouched by excitation light ( the custom macro is available as Source code 1 ) . The STOMP macro provides a semi-automated tool for photo-tagging proteins in pathological deposits . Importantly , unlike LCM , no manual tracing of features is required with STOMP . 10 . 7554/eLife . 09579 . 004Figure 2 . The smallest photo-tagging volume is less than 0 . 5 \u00b5m3 .

Biological replicates of STOMP analysis of amyloid plaque material from TgCRND8 mice show good repeatability . Using our thresholding criteria ( at least three spectral counts for each identified protein , at least threefold excess over corresponding dark control ) one sample run ( P1 ) identified fewer total proteins than the other ( P2 ) , however most proteins identified in P1 were also detected in P2 . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 09579 . 006 We rely on reversible binding of photo-tagged proteins using nickel affinity chromatography . Histidine-rich proteins ubiquitous in all mammalian tissues represent potential contaminants that could bind the nickel affinity beads and confound the STOMP analysis . To circumvent this problem , the first step of the procedure involves limited treatment of the tissue sections with dilute diethyl pyrocarbonate ( DEPC ) . DEPC covalently modifies histidyl residues that abolishes their ability to bind nickel ( Wallis and Holbrook , 1973 ) . After completion of the photo-tagging step , the specimen is solubilized in buffer containing 2% SDS , 8 M urea , and \u03b2-mercaptoethanol ( \u03b2-ME ) . The photo-tagged proteins are purified using nickel affinity beads that bind the hexahistidyl moiety of 6HisBP . The purified proteins are then analyzed by gel electrophoresis ( Figure 1D ) and identified by database searching spectra from peptides resulting from digestion and liquid-chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry ( LC-MS/MS ) . To establish the spatial resolution limits of our photo-tagging procedure , we tagged single-voxel spots within sections of methanol-fixed murine brain tissue . By subsequently staining the tissue with an anti-hexahistidine antibody , we were able to use confocal immunofluorescence imaging to directly visualize and measure the extent of the photo-tagged volume . We measured the diameter ( full width at half-maximum , FWHM ) of the phototagged volume at 0 . 67 \u00b5m along the x and y axes , and 1 . 48 \u00b5m along the z axis ( Figure 2 ) . Taking the excited region to be an ellipsoid , the total volume of a single spot is 0 . 38 \u00b5m3 . We used TgCRND8 mice , a well-characterized transgenic mouse model of AD ( Chishti et al . , 2001 ) , as a model system for the development of the STOMP technique . These mice express a human form of the amyloid precursor protein carrying two mutations associated with familial AD , and they produce amyloid plaques and exhibit spatial learning impairments by 3 months of age . This study used frozen sections ( post-fixed in methanol ) of the brains known to contain plaques , from TgCRND8 mice of 8 months of age . Sets of serial sections on separate slides were treated with DEPC , stained with ThS , and soaked in a solution of 6HisBP . Slides were imaged by confocal microscopy to identify ThS-positive amyloid deposits . Confocal images of ThS-positive amyloid deposits ( Figure 1C1 ) were used to construct individual masks ( Figure 1C2 ) . Because our technique hinges on selective photolabeling and purification , we needed to assess the extent of non-specific labeling of 6HisBP in ambient light and under immunofluorescence excitation , as well as non-specific binding to affinity purification beads . Adjacent sections were put aside as \u2018dark\u2019 controls used to assess the extent of non-specific labeling of 6HisBP to proteins caused by confocal laser light ( 488 nm ) exposure or other handling , and to assess nonspecific binding of proteins to nickel affinity beads . The STOMP macro was used to deliver two-photon excitation light to regions of the specimen corresponding to each pixel in the mask image . This excitation light has two effects . First , and most importantly , it photo-activates 6HisBP molecules that are in the amyloid deposits causing photo-tagging of constituent proteins . Second , it serendipitously photo-bleaches the ThS fluorophores present in regions of the specimen targeted by the mask . Immunofluorescence staining of the tissue section with anti-His6 antibody after photo-activation superimposes on the digital mask , thus highlighting the very high accuracy of targeting of the two-photon laser ( Figure 1C3 ) . STOMP combines microscopy with selective photo-labeling to accurately resolve , capture , and affinity-label highly irregular shaped micron-scale structures , via a semi-automated procedure . After solubilization of the specimen , the photo-tagged proteins were bound to nickel affinity beads . Each sample was divided into two portions: one used for mass spectrometry ( Table 1 ) and one for gel electrophoresis and silver staining ( Figure 1D ) . The dark control sample , which\u2014aside from two-photon excitation\u2014was treated identically to the STOMP sample , was run alongside the STOMP sample . It shows very few bands in the silver-stain gel from material bound to the nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid ( Ni-NTA ) beads compared to the STOMP sample , confirming that nonspecific photo-tagging and nonspecific binding of proteins to the nickel affinity beads is minimal . In addition to a number of proteins ranging in molecular weight from 20 kDa to >250 kDa , the STOMP sample contains large amounts of a low molecular weight protein that was subsequently identified as A\u03b2 ( 4 . 5 kDa ) ( Figure 1D ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 09579 . 007Table 1 .

As an additional control , an entire brain section fixed in methanol and soaked with photo-tag was photo-activated by exposure to 365 nm ultraviolet light . Section-wide photo-activation of this specimen caused indiscriminate photo-tagging of proteins in the specimen . Gel electrophoresis of the indiscriminately photo-tagged proteins reveals a very different pattern of protein bands compared to the specimen in which amyloid plaques were specifically targeted for STOMP analysis ( Figure 1D ) . The total volume of tissue that needs to be photo-tagged to obtain sufficient material for mass spectrometry analysis is a subjective matter and also depends on instrument sensitivity , fixation method used , sample complexity and perhaps other factors . Greater amounts of tissue will increase sensitivity and enable identification of lower abundance proteins , particularly in very complex samples containing a large number of unique proteins . In this study , we were able to identify proteins present in relative abundance in the pathological feature being examined using a total photo-tagged volume of approximately 2 \u00d7 106 \u00b5m3 . ( This corresponds to a photo-tagged region of 500 \u00b5m \u00d7 500 \u00b5m in an 8-\u00b5m thick tissue section or a cube of photo-tagged tissue 130 \u03bcm on a side . ) Lowering the stringency will increase the number of hits but may introduce more false positives . Two frozen sections of TgCRND8 brain tissue were sufficient to produce the necessary volume of photo-tagged tissue required for one STOMP experiment , and the process required a total of 12\u201316 hr of microscope time per sample ( 6\u20138 hr per section ) . Based on our determination of the resolution of STOMP , regions of interest ( ROIs ) as small as 0 . 38 \u00b5m can be analyzed ( Figure 2 ) . To analyze such small features , however , sufficient numbers of ROIs must be captured , and this may necessitate pooling photo-tagged material from several tissue sections . Protein identification via mass spectrometry involved on-bead digestion of the photo-tagged proteins with endoproteinase Lys-C followed by trypsin and LC-MS/MS analysis . We performed technical and biological replicates of the proteomic analyses of our STOMP experiment . The technical replicates ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1 ) demonstrate a very high degree of correlation ( r2 = 0 . 98 ) , and the biological replicates demonstrate significant overlap in proteins identified ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . The replicate studies illustrate the high reproducibility of the technique . The list of all identified proteins in amyloid plaques of TgCRND8 mice based on our high stringency criteria is summarized in Table 1 . The aim of STOMP is to provide a compendium of annotated proteins present within the ROI under study\u2014whether or not they are enriched or depleted relative to the surrounding tissue . As regards the quantitative nature of the data , Table 1 collects and summarizes our high-confidence mass spectrometry protein identifications , sorted by molecular-weight-normalized spectral counts: a semi-quantitative proxy for protein abundance . As expected , the most abundant protein found in STOMP from TgCRND8 mouse plaques was A\u03b2 ( Figure 1D , Table 1 ) . In addition to A\u03b2 , we identified 454 proteins in at least one of two biological replicates ( Supplementary file 1 ) . Combining our biological and technical replicates with our negative controls ( \u2018dark\u2019 samples and replicates ) , we used the Significance Analysis of INTeractome ( SAINT ) algorithm ( Choi et al . , 2011 ) , which uses Bayesian inference to assign a probability of a true interaction , using A\u03b2 as the bait protein . We found 62 proteins with probability >0 . 8 of being found associated with the plaques , and 146 with probability >0 . 5 ( Supplementary file 1 ) . Among these , synaptosomal proteins were highly enriched , including SNAP25 , vesicle-associated membrane protein 2 ( VAMP2 ) , vesicular proton pump ATPase ( v-ATPase ) , and synapsins 1 and 2 . Apolipoprotein E , which is sometimes associated with senile plaques ( Thal et al . , 1997 ) , was also detected , albeit at a SAINT score of 0 . 70 ( Supplementary file 1 ) . Certain common synaptic markers\u2014including chromogranin A/C , synaptophysin , synaptogyrin I , synaptoporin , \u03b1-synuclein , and VGLUT1 and 2\u2014were not detected in the plaques . Interestingly , the plaques were also devoid of uniquely post-synaptic proteins . We also identified many mitochondrial proteins; although the reason for this is unclear , it may be that the intrinsic hydrophobicity of mitochondrial membrane proteins may predispose them to associate with amyloid plaques . Comparison with proteins found from STOMP analysis of non-plaque areas revealed only limited overlap ( Supplementary file 2 ) ; VAMP2 , synapsin 1 , and dynamin 1 are present in both plaque and non-plaque STOMP analysis but are significantly greater enriched in the plaque STOMP samples . Using confocal microscopy , we examined colocalization of ThS-positive plaques with immunfluorescently labeled A\u03b2 , SNAP25 , VAMP2 , v-ATPase , synapsin 1 , and ApoE . All were found to be present and are apparently genuine components of the amyloid plaque ( Figure 3 ) . Optical sectioning demonstrates the presence of each of these proteins in the core of the amyloid plaques suggesting they were incorporated at the earliest stages of plaque formation . Staining of SNAP25 , VAMP2 , and v-ATPase reveal an immunopositive halo surrounding each of the plaques indicating an accumulation of these proteins not only in the amyloid core but also in the vicinity of the plaques; interestingly , synapsin 1 immunostaining did not have this halo . 10 . 7554/eLife . 09579 . 008Figure 3 .

Immunostaining of some of these markers , syntaxin 1 , synaptophysin , and \u03b1-synuclein , confirmed that these proteins are not concentrated in the amyloid plaques ( Figure 4 ) . \u03b1-Synuclein has been reported to be associated with senile plaques in human patients with AD; however , TgCRND8 mice are known to not accumulate \u03b1-synuclein in their plaques ( Xu et al . , 2002 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 09579 . 009Figure 4 . Common synaptic or disease-associated proteins in plaques of TgCRND8 mice not detected by STOMP are also absent by immunofluorescence . The SNARE protein syntaxin-1 ( A ) , synaptic marker synaptophysin ( B ) , the neuronal protein alpha-synuclein ( C ) are absent from ThS-positive plaques ( G , H , I , M , N , O ) . Staining of the glial protein GFAP ( D ) surrounds the ThS-positive plaques but does not infiltrate the plaque core ( J , P ) . Scale bar 50 \u00b5m . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 09579 . 009 It is not clear why the amyloid deposits contain some pre-synaptic proteins , but not others , and are devoid of post-synaptic proteins . One possibility is that damaged dystrophic neurites that are known to surround the plaques ( Chishti et al . , 2001 ) are spilling their contents and the physical properties of certain pre-synaptic proteins cause them to bind with especially high affinity to amyloid plaques . In this regard , it is noteworthy that many of these proteins are membrane proteins with coiled coil domains ( Takamori et al . , 2006 ) . Another possibility , which is not mutually exclusive and provides an explanation for the presence of pre-synaptic proteins in plaques , is that A\u03b2 fibrils and/or oligomers bind directly to synaptic vesicles and interfere with synaptic function . Evidence for a damaging effect of A\u03b2 on synapses and dendrites has been available for some time ( Mattson et al . , 1998 ) . Diffusible A\u03b2 oligomers added to cultured primary neurons have been shown to associate with synaptosomes and a concomitant synaptic deterioration is observed ( Lacor et al . , 2007 ) . In post-mortem AD tissue and in transgenic AD mice , an inverse correlation between levels of A\u03b2 oligomers and levels of synaptic proteins was noted ( Pham et al . , 2010 ) . The reduction in the levels of detectable synaptic protein in AD tissue may be the result of the aggregation and entrapment of the synaptic proteins in the amyloid plaques . In sum , the STOMP technique has provided clear evidence of interaction of amyloid plaques with pre-synaptic proteins . After developing the STOMP method using brain sections of TgCRND8 mice as the test subject , we applied the technique to senile plaques from a case of AD . Human tissue is inherently more difficult to work with than animal tissue because of biochemical changes associated with post-mortem degradation . Furthermore , formalin , the fixative of choice for human tissue , causes covalent modification of proteins and confounds mass spectrometry analysis . These limitations notwithstanding , we find the STOMP technique is suitable for the analysis of formalin-fixed post-mortem human tissue . Senile plaques from brain sections of a severe case of AD were visualized with ThS and photo-tagged using a procedure identical to that used for the TgCRND8 tissue . Mass spectrometry analysis of the protein composition of these senile plaques identified 60 proteins that were statistically significantly enriched , with A\u03b2 being the most abundant protein component ( Table 2 ) . Synaptic proteins and proteins involved in synaptic vesicle transport comprised 15% of the abundant protein component of the plaques . For validation of the STOMP analysis of senile plaques , immunofluorescence staining was employed , revealing that GFAP and SNAP25 were detected by both immunofluorescence , while tau and \u03b1-synuclein were not detected by either technique ( Figure 5 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 09579 . 010Table 2 .

Immunofluorescent confirmation of results of STOMP analysis of senile plaques in a case of AD . Immunofluorescent confirmation of results of STOMP analysis of senile plaques in a case of AD . GFAP ( A ) , a marker of glial cells , surrounds the ThS-positive plaques and partially infiltrates the plaque core ( E , I ) . Tau in dystrophic neurites ( B ) surrounds the ThS-positive plaques but does not infiltrate the plaque core ( F , J ) . \u03b1-synuclein ( C ) is absent from ThS-positive plaques ( G , K ) . SNAP25 colocalizes with ThS-positive plaques in thiscase of AD ( D , H , L ) . Scale bar is 20 \u03bcm . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 09579 . 011 Gliosis is a well-known feature of AD , and reactive glial cells are often found surrounding amyloid plaques ( Mandybur and Chuirazzi , 1990; Sofroniew and Vinters , 2010 ) . Glial proteins , GFAP and excitatory amino acid transporter ( EAAT ) ( Anderson and Swanson , 2000 ) , were both detected in ( human ) senile plaques ( Table 2 ) ; however , only EAAT was detected in TgCRND8 amyloid plaques ( Table 1 ) . This apparent discrepancy is likely due to astrocytes being more intimately associated with amyloid plaques in human tissue ( Figure 5A , E , I ) compared to plaques in the TgCRND mouse ( Figure 4D , J , P ) . Tau protein was also not among the abundant plaque proteins . Immunofluorescence staining shows that tau , which is contained in dystrophic neurites that surround the plaques , do not occupy the same physical space as the plaques and were hence not detected in the STOMP analysis ( Figure 3B , H , N ) . SNAP25 , on the other hand , was detected in the STOMP analysis and was seen to colocalize with senile plaques ( Figure 5D , H , L ) and amyloid plaques from TgCRND8 mice ( Figure 3C , I , O ) . \u03b1-synuclein is part of the NAC ( non-amyloid components ) of plaques\u2014with a possible role in fibril formation but not part of the plaque core ( Culvenor et al . , 1999; Wirths and Bayer , 2003 ) . These proteins were found not to be enriched in the plaques of this case of AD as detected by both STOMP analysis ( Table 2 ) or by immunofluorescent staining ( Figure 5C , G , K ) . Immunohistochemical staining of pre-synaptic proteins , SNAP25 , VAMP2 , and synaptophysin in senile plaques from human patients with AD was similar to the immunofluoresence staining in the AD mice , with some notable differences ( Figure 6 ) . Senile plaques in the human AD tissue were positive for both SNAP25 and VAMP2 . However , synaptophysin staining , which was absent in the amyloid deposits of AD mice , displayed a unique punctate lobular profile that decorated the periphery of the plaque in the human tissue ( Figure 6 ) . These STOMP analyses demonstrate the molecular differences of amyloid deposits in AD mice compared to senile plaques in AD patients , but confirm the segregation of these pre-synaptic proteins in and around amyloid plaques and point to their potential importance in AD pathophysiology . 10 . 7554/eLife . 09579 . 012Figure 6 . Microphotographs of Synaptophysin ( A ) , VAMP2 ( B ) and SNAP25 ( C ) immunohistochemistry on the brain of human Alzheimer's disease cases . The amyloid plaques ( arrow ) are positive for VAMP2 and SNAP25 , whereas synaptophysin does not stain the core of the plaques and punctate lobular profiles decorating the plaque are positive for synaptophysin . Scale bar is 30 \u00b5m . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 09579 . 012 Some proteins identified by STOMP ( including v-ATPase , dynamin , SNAP25 , VAMP2 , synapsin , clathrin , ankyrin , and so on; see Tables 1 , 2 and Supplementary file 3 ) were detected in previous LCM-based studies; however , with the exception of v-ATPase and dynamin , these proteins were not previously shown to be significantly or sufficiently enriched compared to the control samples ( Liao et al . , 2004 ) . The highly specific nature of STOMP protein labeling and recovery permits very sensitive detection of proteins present in plaques , even if those proteins are also abundant in the remainder of the brain . We have shown that the STOMP technique can be used to determine the proteomic composition of micron-scale microscopic features . The procedure does not require large quantities of tissue and can be completed in a reasonable amount of time . Using amyloid plaques in TgCRND8 mice as a test subject , we demonstrated that STOMP is capable of determining the protein composition of pathological deposits in neurodegenerative disease . Our discovery that there is an accumulation of certain pre-synaptic proteins in AD plaques and in TgCRND8 mice provides direct evidence for an association between amyloid plaque formation and synaptic function . While our initial work in characterizing amyloid deposits in mouse brain used methanol fixed tissues to minimize problems with solubilizing tissue , our experience with human AD pathological tissue shows that STOMP of formalin-fixed archival tissue is possible . The STOMP technique is ideally suited for determination of the compositions of intracellular protein inclusions seen in ALS and FTD . While the principle components of these inclusions , such as TDP-439 , FUS ( Kwiatkowski et al . , 2009; Vance et al . , 2009 ) , and dipeptide repeat proteins ( Mori et al . , 2013 ) are known , determination of the secondary components of the inclusions could shed light on disease etiology . In developing the STOMP technique , we have focused on identification of photo-tagged proteins , however , the nonspecific nature of benzophenone photochemistry should cause photo-tagging of nonprotein components as well . In this regard , the STOMP technique can easily be modified to identify the RNA composition of biological features . RNA-containing subcellular structures such as P-bodies and stress granules have been implicated in neurodegenerative disease ( Li et al . , 2013 ) ; these structures are of suitable size for STOMP , and there is a realistic possibility of determining jointly their proteomic and transcriptomic composition with this technique . The application of this technique to many other aspects of cell biology research is also conceivable . \n The 6HisBP peptide ( 4-benzoyl-benzamidyl-Gly-His-His-His-His-His-His-amide , Figure 1 ) was synthesized using FMOC-His ( Trt ) -OH , FMOC-Gly-OH ( Avanced Chemtech , Louisville , KY ) and 4-benzoylbenzoic acid; all synthesis steps were carried out in N , N-dimethylformamide ( DMF ) . FMOC cleavage employed 2% 1 , 8-diazabicyclo[5 . 4 . 0]undec-7-ene ( DBU ) ; activation and coupling used 0 . 5 M N , N-diisopropylethylamine ( DIPEA ) and o- ( 7-azabenzotriazol-1-yl ) -N , N , N\u2032 , N\u2032-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate ( HATU , Applied Biosystems , Waltham , MA ) . The peptide was cleaved from the resin by incubating in 5 ml of a solution containing trifluoroacetic acid , thioanisole , ethanedithiol , and anisole in the volume ratio of 90:5:3:2 , for 2 hr at room temperature , then precipitated by dropwise addition to 40 ml \u221270\u00b0C diethyl ether . The crude 6HisBP was washed five times with cold diethyl ether to remove residual cleavage reagents , dried under nitrogen , redissolved in ultrapure water , frozen , and lyophilized ( Freezone 4 . 5 , Labconco , Kansas City , MO ) to remove any remaining volatiles . The presence of 6HisBP was confirmed by ESI-MS . Transgenic CRND8 ( TgCRND8 ) mice express a transgene that encodes human amyloid precursor protein ( APP695 ) harboring both the \u2018Swedish\u2019 double mutation KM670/671/NL and the additional \u2018Indiana\u2019 point mutation V717F; they develop dense-cored amyloid plaques and neuritic pathology by 5 months of age ( Chishti et al . , 2001 ) . Animals were sacrificed at 8 months and their brains were embedded in OCT medium for frozen sectioning onto glass slides . Sections were post-fixed by immersion for 10 min in \u221220\u00b0C methanol , air dried at room temperature , and stored at \u221270\u00b0C . Brain sections were treated with DEPC to covalently modify endogenous histidyl residues and abolish their capacity to bind to nickel . Sections were rehydrated by immersion in DEPC buffer ( 10 mM NaHCO3 , 10 mM NaH2PO4 , pH adjusted to 6 . 0 with hydrochloric acid ) . An initial working solution of 1 M DEPC in methanol was prepared immediately before use and diluted in DEPC buffer to 10 mM DEPC . Tissue sections were immersed in DEPC solution for 3 hr at room temperature , then washed twice with PBS . Sections were stained with 1% ThS . Sections were soaked in two changes of 6HisBP working solution ( 12 mM 6HisBP , 10 mM sodium phosphate , pH 7 . 6 ) , then coverslipped . For each STOMP sample , a \u2018dark\u2019 control was prepared from an adjacent section . All experiments were performed in accordance with the guidelines imposed by the University of Toronto Animal Care Committee and Canadian Council for Animal Care . Microscopy employed Zeiss LSM 510 and LSM 710 confocal microscopes , equipped with two-photon infrared ( Coherent Chameleon , tuned to 720 nm ) laser sources . ThS fluorescence was excited at 488 nm and imaged confocally through 505 nm longpass or 500\u2013530 nm bandpass filters . The nominal pixel spacing was 0 . 44 . 44\u00d7 0 . 44 \u00b5m using a 20\u00d7 1 . 20 NA water immersion objective lens . Masks containing only amyloid plaques were created using the following four-step process in ImageJ ( Schneider et al . , 2012 ) . High-frequency noise in the ThS fluorescence image was removed using ImageJ's \u2018Smooth\u2019 function , and vascular amyloid deposits\u2014if any\u2014were manually excluded from each fluorescence image . Dense-cored plaques were highlighted with the \u2018Threshold\u2019 tool . Finally , the \u2018Erode\u2019 method was used to trim a single-pixel ( 0 . 44 \u00b5m ) margin from the mask edge , to ensure that only material definitely within the plaque would be photo-tagged . The resulting mask image was saved as a \u2018text image\u2019 . Using a custom macro for controlling the two-photon microscope ( Pham et al . , 2007 ) each pixel in the mask image was irradiated six times , for 4 ms on each pass . A detailed description of the STOMP macro interface available in Source code 1 . The total volume photo-activated was approximately 2 \u00d7 106 \u00b5m3 per sample ( 1 \u00d7 106 \u03bcm3 per section ) . Each section was lifted from the slide using a clean , sterile razor blade and transferred into a 1 . 5-ml polypropylene microcentrifuge tube . For methanol-fixed murine tissue , 200 \u03bcl of solubilization buffer containing 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate ( SDS , Bio-Rad , Hercules , CA ) , 8 M urea , 250 mM NaCl , 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer ( pH 8 . 2 ) , 10% ( wt/vol ) glycerol , and 2% \u03b2-ME was added to each tube . Tubes were immersed in a boiling water bath for 5 min , sonicated for 5 min in a Branson 1210 bath sonicator ( Branson Ultrasonic Corporation , Danbury , CT ) , incubated at room temperature for 45 min , and returned to boiling water for an additional 5 min to fully solubilize the tissue sample . For solubilization of formalin-fixed human tissue , 400 \u00b5l of a modified solubilization buffer containing 200 mM Tris ( in addition to the ingredients noted above , as a formaldehyde scavenger ) was used . Formalin-fixed sections were held at 90\u00b0C for 60 min . Each sample was transferred to a 15-ml polypropylene centrifuge tube and combined with a 20-fold excess of room-temperature dilution buffer ( 8 M urea , 250 mM NaCl , 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer , 1 mM imidazole ) to dilute the SDS , \u03b2-ME , and Tris to concentrations compatible with Ni-NTA agarose bead binding . 80 \u03bcl of Ni-NTA agarose bead slurry ( Qiagen , Valencia , CA ) was added , and the mixture was tumbled overnight at room temperature to allow the His-tagged proteins to bind to the beads . After binding , the beads were pelleted by centrifugation at 500\u00d7g for 30 s . The supernatant was discarded , and the beads were resuspended in 1 ml wash buffer ( 6 M urea , 0 . 1% SDS , 250 mM NaCl , 10 mM phosphate at pH 8 . 2 , 0 . 1% \u03b2-ME , 1 mM imidazole ) and tumbled for 2 min . This wash was repeated three times . During the final wash step , each sample was divided into two portions: one reserved for mass spectrometry , and one for gel electrophoresis and silver staining . After recovery , the proteins captured on the surface of the beads for each sample were solubilized in 8 M urea with 50 mM Tris at pH 8 , reduced by 5 mM DTT for 1 hr , and alkylated with 10 mM iodoacetamide for 45 min in darkness at room temperature . Proteins were digested at RT with Endoproteinase Lys-C ( Roche ) for 6 hr first , and then diluted ninefold into ammonium bicarbonate buffer before adding sequencing grade trypsin ( Promega ) overnight . After acidification to 1% formic acid ( FA ) , mixtures were desalted using disposable Toptip C-18 columns ( Glygen ) and the eluted peptides lyophilized to dryness . Peptides were loaded and separated on sequential reverse phase micro-capillary liquid trap and analytical columns using an EASY-nLC nanoflow pump system ( Proxeon ) . The micro-capillary trap column was constructed in a 25 mm \u00d7 75 mm silica capillary packed with 5 \u03bcm Luna C18 stationary phase ( Phenomenex ) . The analytical column was constructed in a 100 mm \u00d7 75 \u03bcm silica capillary , with a fine tip pulled with a column puller ( Sutter Instruments ) , packed with 3 \u03bcm Luna C18 stationary phase . Separation was performed in 105 min using an organic gradient w consisting of buffer A ( 5% acetonitrile with 0 . 1% FA ) to buffer B ( 95% acetonitrile with 0 . 1% FA ) at a flow rate of 300 nl/min starting with a gradient of 2\u20136% buffer B in 1 min , followed by 6\u201324% in 74 min , 24\u201390% in 16 min , then 90% buffer B for 5 min and 90\u20130% in 1 min and finally 0% buffer B in 8 min . Eluted peptides were electrosprayed from a nanospray ion source ( Proxeon ) directly into a high-performance Orbitrap Velos hybrid tandem mass spectrometer ( ThermoFisher Scientific ) . 10 data-dependent collision-induced dissociation ( CID ) ion trap scans ( centroid mode ) were automatically acquired simultaneously with one high resolution ( 60 , 000 FWHM resolution ) full scan ( profile mode ) mass spectra . A dynamic exclusion list was enabled to exclude a maximum of 500 ion targets for 22 . 5 s . RAW data files were extracted with the ReAdW program and submitted to database search using SEQUEST ( v2 . 7 ) against UniProt/SwissProt protein sequence FASTA file containing 22 , 491 human proteins as well as an equivalent number of reversed decoy proteins ( to estimate the empirical false discovery rate ) . Search parameters were set to allow for one missed cleavage site and one fixed modification ( +57 on cysteine ) using a precursor tolerance of 3 m/z . Matched peptides were further filtered at the precursor ion mass accuracy level using a 20 ppm cut-off , while protein hits were compiled and filtered using the StatQuest program with a minimum confidence threshold of 99% . Silver staining employed an adaptation of the method of Shevchenko et al . ( 1996 ) . Gels were fixed in 6% formaldehyde and 25% ethanol for 1 hr and washed with water . Gels were sensitized for 45 min in 50 ppm sodium thiosulfate solution , soaked in 0 . 1% silver nitrate for 45 min , rinsed with ultrapure water , and developed for approximately 1 min in a solution of 2% sodium carbonate with 0 . 037% formaldehyde . Development was stopped with 50 mM EDTA . Silver-stained gels were photographed with an EOS 550D digital camera ( Canon , Tokyo , Japan ) . TgCRND8 brain sections were stained with 1% ThS and blocked overnight with 10% fetal bovine serum ( FCS ) in PBS . Sections were incubated with primary antibodies against \u03b2-amyloid peptide , SNAP25 , synapsin 1 , synaptophysin , syntaxin 1 , \u03b1-synuclein , V-type proton ATPase subunit B ( ATP6V1B2 ) or VAMP2 at the dilutions indicated in Supplementary file 4 , and then with the appropriate Texas Red-labeled secondary . Formalin-fixed , paraffin-embedded sections of human brain from deceased AD patients were incubated with synaptophysin , SNAP25 , and VAMP2 antibodies at the dilutions indicated in Supplementary file 4 . After incubation with secondary antibodies , immunoreactivity was developed using diaminobenzidine and counterstained with hematoxylin . Tissues from AD cases were collected with patient consent and handled under protocols approved by the University Health Network . TgCRND8 brain sections ( frozen sectioned , methanol post-fixed , DEPC treated ) were soaked in 6HisBP solution , and a single pixel spot was photo-tagged using the STOMP macro as described above . Unbound photo-tag was then washed out of the section with several changes of PBS . Sections were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin , incubated with an anti-hexahistidine antibody , and fluorescently labeled with an Alexa 488-conjugated secondary antibody . A high-resolution confocal z stack of immunofluorescence images was collected using a 63\u00d7 1 . 4 NA oil-immersion objective . Maximum intensity projections through the resulting z stacks were used to quantify the extent of the photo-tagged spot . Fluorescence intensity profiles through the center of the spot in x , y , and z directions were extracted using ImageJ and fitted with a Gaussian curve using OriginPro 8 . 5 . 0 ( OriginLab , Northampton MA ) to determine the width ( FWHM ) of the spot in each dimension .", "headings": ["Abstract", "Introduction", "Results and discussion", "Materials and methods"], "keywords": ["biochemistry and chemical biology"], "id": "elife-09579-v2"}
{"lay_summary": "For the nervous system to become wired up correctly , neurons within the developing embryo must project over long distances to form connections with remote targets . They do this by lengthening their axons\u2014the \u2018cables\u2019 along which electrical signals flow\u2014and some axons in adult humans can grow to be more than 1 metre long . This type of long-range pathfinding activity is particularly common for neurons that control movement , as many of these neurons must establish connections with muscles that are some distance away from the brain . For example , motor neurons in the brainstem form connections with muscles in the face to control facial expressions , while motor neurons in parts of the spinal cord project to muscles in the limbs . Multiple signaling pathways tell the developing axons which direction to grow en route to their final targets . Now , Hua et al . have shown that an evolutionarily conserved protein called Frizzled3 is also involved in this process . In mouse embryos that lacked Frizzled3 , the motor nerves that control breathing and limb movements were thinner than those in normal mice . In the mutant animals , many motor axons failed to form connections with their targets . Instead , these axons came to an abrupt halt midway along their intended paths and the neurons from which they originated died soon afterwards . These experiments support the idea that developing neurons are programmed to die unless their axons progress on the appropriate schedule . As well as increasing our knowledge of the networks of connections that form within the developing mammalian nervous system , the work of Hua et al . provides new insights into some of the molecular mechanisms by which these connections are established .", "article": "Disruption of the Frizzled3 ( Fz3 ) gene leads to defects in axonal growth in the VIIth and XIIth cranial motor nerves , the phrenic nerve , and the dorsal motor nerve in fore- and hindlimbs . In Fz3\u2212/\u2212 limbs , dorsal axons stall at a precise location in the nerve plexus , and , in contrast to the phenotypes of several other axon path-finding mutants , Fz3\u2212/\u2212 dorsal axons do not reroute to other trajectories . Affected motor neurons undergo cell death 2 days prior to the normal wave of developmental cell death that coincides with innervation of muscle targets , providing in vivo evidence for the idea that developing neurons with long-range axons are programmed to die unless their axons arrive at intermediate targets on schedule . These experiments implicate planar cell polarity ( PCP ) signaling in motor axon growth and they highlight the question of how PCP proteins , which form cell\u2013cell complexes in epithelia , function in the dynamic context of axonal growth . \n The vertebrate nervous system is highly evolved to extract , integrate , retrieve , and transform information , a functional sophistication that is mirrored in the complexity of its underlying neural circuits . These circuits are produced by precisely orchestrated patterns of neuronal proliferation , migration , and differentiation , and by the establishment of specific synaptic connections between neurons and their targets . For neurons with distant targets , making the appropriate connections depends on accurate long-range navigation by their growing axons ( Dickson , 2002; O\u2019Donnell et al . , 2009 ) . Motor neurons represent an attractive system in which to study axonal growth and guidance because motor axons generally grow over great distances along highly stereotyped pathways . Motor neurons in the brainstem extend their axons within cranial nerves to control muscles involved in feeding , facial expression , and eye , neck , and head movements ( Guthrie , 2007 ) . Motor neurons in the spinal cord are arranged in longitudinal columns along the rostrocaudal axis , and the neurons in different columns innervate distinct peripheral targets ( Landmesser , 1978; Bonanomi and Pfaff , 2010 ) . Spinal motor neurons in the lateral motor column ( LMC ) innervate the limbs and are therefore present only at brachial and lumbar levels . The LMC is divided into lateral ( LMCL ) and medial ( LMCM ) divisions , which innervate , respectively , the dorsal and ventral limb musculature . For motor axons that innervate the limb musculature , different signaling systems\u2014including the Cxcl12/Cxcr4 , GDNF/Ret , Ephrin/Eph , and Semaphorin/Neuropilin ( Npn ) systems\u2014provide information at different decision points during axonal navigation ( Helmbacher et al . , 2000; Huber et al . , 2005; Lieberam et al . , 2005; Kramer et al . , 2006; Luria et al . , 2008; Bonanomi et al . , 2012; reviewed in Bonanomi and Pfaff , 2010 ) . Cxcl12/Cxcr4 signaling is required for the initial emergence of motor axons from the ventral face of the spinal cord , with ventral axons expressing the Cxcr4 receptor and thereby conferring responsiveness to Cxcl12 , which is produced by the adjacent mesenchyme . Sema3A , which is produced throughout the limb bud mesenchyme , acts on Npn1-expressing motor axons shortly after these axons emerge from the spinal cord to control the timing of outgrowth and axon fasciculation; and Sema3F , which is produced in the dorsal limb mesenchyme , repels Npn2-expressing LMCM axons to promote a ventral trajectory . The dorsal/ventral decision is also controlled by cooperative and mutually reinforcing interactions between Ephrin/Eph and GDNF/Ret signaling . GDNF , which is produced in the dorsal limb bud , attracts LMCL axons , which express high levels of the Ret receptor . Ephrin-A , which is produced in the ventral limb bud , repels LMCL axons , which express EphA4 . At present , the signaling pathways that determine more distal axon branching patterns and control the specificity of nerve-muscle recognition remain largely unknown . The experiments described here reveal an important role for Frizzled signaling in motor axon growth . Frizzled receptors are found throughout the animal kingdom and mediate at least three distinct types of signaling: ( 1 ) canonical signaling , in which Wnt binding to Frizzled activates an Lrp co-receptor to elicit stabilization of cytosolic beta-catenin , which then migrates to the nucleus to control gene expression in cooperation with LEF/TCF transcription factors; ( 2 ) tissue polarity or planar cell polarity ( PCP ) signaling , which acts in many epithelia and features the asymmetric localization of Frizzled and several other proteins in plasma membrane complexes to control cytoskeletal organization; and ( 3 ) Wnt/calcium signaling , the least understood of the three pathways , in which Wnt binding to Frizzled receptors leads to release of intracellular calcium ( Angers and Moon , 2009; Nusse , 2012 ) . The PCP pathway was discovered in Drosophila as a regulator of cuticular hair and bristle polarity ( Simons and Mlodzik , 2008 ) . The core set of PCP proteins defined by the Drosophila experiments\u2014Frizzled , Dishevelled , Van Gogh/Strabismus , Prickle , Flamingo/Starry Night , and Diego\u2014are conserved in vertebrates . Over the past 15 years , studies in mice , frogs , and zebrafish have shown that core PCP genes play central roles in a wide variety of developmental processes that involve directional information: coordinating cell movements during neural tube elongation and closure ( convergent/extension movements ) , setting up the global orientation of hairs within mammalian skin , orienting motile cilia within epithelia to produce coherent fluid flow , and orienting asymmetric bundles of stereocilia on the apical faces of auditory and vestibular sensory hair cells ( Wang and Nathans , 2007; Bayly and Axelrod , 2011; Goodrich and Strutt , 2011 ) . In mammals , two of the ten Frizzled family members\u2014Frizzled3 ( Fz3 ) and Fz6\u2014appear to be devoted largely or exclusively to tissue polarity signaling . Fz6 controls hair orientation , and Fz3 and Fz6 act redundantly to control inner ear sensory hair cell orientation and neural tube closure ( Guo et al . , 2004; Wang et al . , 2006a ) . Among Frizzled receptors , Fz3 is unique in its role in controlling axon guidance in the central nervous system ( CNS ) , where it is required for the development of major fiber tracts , including the corpus callosum , and the thalamocortical , corticothalamic , and nigrostriatal tracts ( Wang et al . , 2002 , 2006b ) . Fz3 appears to be part of a system that provides directional information to growing axons , as indicated by the observation that in Fz3\u2212/\u2212 embryos commissural sensory axons in the spinal cord orient randomly instead of turning rostrally after midline crossing ( Lyuksyutova et al . , 2003 ) . Virtually identical CNS axon phenotypes are observed in embryos lacking Celsr3 , one of three mammalian homologues of the core PCP protein Flamingo/Starry Night ( Tissir et al . , 2005 ) . Fz3 and Celsr1-Celsr3 are also required for caudal and tangential migration of VIIth cranial ( facial branchiomotor ) nerve neurons within the developing brainstem ( Qu et al . , 2010 ) . In the periphery , Fz3 and Celsr3 are required for correctly orienting enteric neurons within the gastrointestinal tract , and Fz3 is required for the development of sympathetic chain ganglia and innervation of sympathetic targets ( Armstrong et al . 2011; Sasselli et al . , 2013 ) . In the present work , we have identified a hitherto unrecognized role for Fz3 in the growth of motor axons . Using conventional and conditional loss-of-function alleles for Fz3 , we show that Fz3 is required for a subset of cranial and spinal motor axons to grow to their peripheral targets . In the limb , the absence of Fz3 leads to a specific stalling defect among LMCL axons that is distinct from the phenotypes produced by defects in several other signaling systems active in limb axon guidance . Affected cranial and spinal motor neurons die shortly after their axons stall , providing in vivo evidence for the general idea that as growing axons arrive at intermediate targets essential survival signals are relayed to their cell bodies . \n Fz3 is widely expressed in the developing mouse CNS , and therefore it seemed possible that its loss might impair neurodevelopmental processes other than those previously described in the forebrain ( Wang et al . , 2002 , 2006b ) . To systematically assess peripheral axon growth and guidance in E11 . 5-E13 . 5 embryos , we visualized Neurofilament-M ( hereafter \u2018NF\u2019 ) immunoreactivity in whole-mount tissues and in thick ( 0 . 7\u20131 mm ) vibratome sections . We also used the Hb9-EGFP transgene to visualize spinal motor axons , including the phrenic nerve , and the motor component of a subset of cranial nerves ( Wichterle et al . , 2002; Huettl and Huber , 2011 ) . In E11 . 5-E13 . 5 Fz3\u2212/\u2212 embryos anti-NF immunostaining revealed a thinning of the XIIth ( hypoglossal ) nerve ( Figure 1B , B\u2032 ) , the phrenic nerve ( Figure 1C , C\u2032 ) , and the dorsal nerves of the fore- and hindlimbs ( described more fully below ) . Flatmounts of E18 . 5 Hb9-EGFP;Fz3\u2212/\u2212 diaphragms co-stained for GFP and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors ( using alpha-bungarotoxin; \u2018alpha-BTX\u2019 ) showed variability in phrenic nerve thickness within the diaphragm that correlated with nerve branching defects , and a decrease in the number of neuromuscular junctions ( Figure 1D\u2013H\u2032\u2032 ) . The innervation defect was especially common in the most ventral region of the diaphragm where many alpha-BTX binding sites were scattered across the muscle surface , both diffusely and in clusters , indicative of a failure of neuromuscular junction formation . 10 . 7554/eLife . 01482 . 003Figure 1 .

Scale bars: ( H ) , 1 mm; ( H\u2032\u2032 ) , 100 \u00b5m . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 01482 . 003 We have classified phrenic nerve defects as mild ( the entire diaphragm innervated , but thin phrenic nerve and a decrease in the number of branches and synapses ) , moderate ( similar to mild defects but , additionally , ventral diaphragm not innervated ) , severe ( similar to moderate defects , and , additionally , the crus of the diaphragm not innervated ) , and complete ( phrenic nerve is very thin with minimal innervation across the diaphragm ) . Among 23 Fz3\u2212/\u2212 hemi-diaphragms analyzed , the frequencies of these classes were 4/23 , 14/23 , 4/23 , and 1/23 , respectively ( Figure 1E\u2013H\u2032\u2032 ) . Among 42 wildtype ( WT ) or Fz3+/\u2212 control hemi-diaphragms , all showed complete diaphragm innervation , with alpha-BTX binding sites tightly clustered at nerve terminals ( Figure 1D\u2013D\u2032\u2032 ) . Most peripheral nerves are composed of both motor and sensory axons , and therefore a defect in one of these components would be expected to produce a decrease in nerve thickness but not a complete absence of the nerve when visualized with NF immunostaining . To search selectively for defects in cholinergic neurons , including motor neurons , we examined Fz3\u2212/\u2212 embryos that carried a ChAT-IRES-Cre knock-in allele and a Cre-controlled alkaline phosphatase ( AP ) reporter , R26iAP ( Badea et al . , 2009 ) . In the mouse embryo , Choline acetyl transferase ( ChAT ) expression is first detectable at \u223cE13 . 5 ( Schambra et al . , 1989; Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez et al . , 1991 ) . However , the rate of accumulation of endogenous ChAT protein is insufficient for robust immunostaining of axons in the prenatal period . By contrast , in ChAT-IRES-Cre;R26iAP mice , Cre-mediated activation of the AP reporter leads to sufficient AP accumulation by E18 . 5 for histochemical labeling of both cholinergic cell bodies and axons . Since Fz3\u2212/\u2212 mice die as neonates , the high sensitivity of the ChAT-IRES-Cre;R26iAP method recommended it for surveying late prenatal cholinergic axons . Cholinergic neurons in the mouse telencephalon can be divided into two major groups: local interneurons in the striatum and projection neurons in the basal forebrain . As seen in Figure 2B , striatal cholinergic neurons are present in E18 . 5 ChAT-IRES-Cre;R26iAP;Fz3\u2212/\u2212 forebrains , but a major cholinergic fiber tract passing through the striatum is missing ( compare Figure 2Bf , Bg vs Figure 2Bf\u2032 , Bg\u2032 ) . In Fz3\u2212/\u2212 brains , cortical and thalamic axons fail to enter the internal capsule and , as a result , the cerebral cortex and the thalamus are disconnected ( Wang et al . , 2002 , 2006b ) . The cholinergic fiber tract that is missing in the E18 . 5 Fz3\u2212/\u2212 forebrain could depend on the same internal capsule navigation system that instructs cortical and thalamic fibers ( Zhou et al . , 2008 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 01482 . 004Figure 2 .

These include: ( 1 ) impaired caudal migration of neurons comprising the VIIth motor nucleus and a loss of motor innervation to the face ( Figure 2C\u2013E\u2032 and Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2G ) ; ( 2 ) diminished staining of cholinergic nerves within the palate and retro-orbital fissure ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2D\u2013F\u2032 ) ; and ( 3 ) decreased motor innervation of the tongue by the XIIth nerve ( Figure 2F\u2013G\u2032 ) . The defect in migration of VIIth motor neurons is consistent with that reported by Qu et al . ( 2010 ) . We also observed a nearly complete loss of cholinergic neurons in the vomeronasal organ ( Figure 2H\u2013I\u2032 ) . By contrast , the IIIrd-VIth , Xth and XIIth motor nuclei appear unaltered in ChAT-IRES-Cre;R26iAP;Fz3\u2212/\u2212 embryos and the trajectories of their axons appear to be normal ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplements 1 and 2 ) . The ChAT-IRES-Cre;R26iAP reporter showed decreased innervation of the Fz3\u2212/\u2212 diaphragm ( Figure 2J\u2013M\u2032 ) , consistent with the analysis presented in Figure 1D\u2013H\u2032\u2032 . The phrenic nerve defects may contribute to the respiratory distress that kills Fz3\u2212/\u2212 neonates . A second contributing factor may be the disorganization of axons in the vicinity of the Pre-B\u00f6tzinger complex ( data not shown ) , the brainstem region that coordinates respiratory movements by controlling the activity of the phrenic motor column ( Smith et al . , 2009 ) . By NF immunostaining of whole-mount E12 embryos , Wang et al . ( 2006b ) observed a series of discrete NF-rich clusters along the caudal half of the Fz3\u2212/\u2212 spinal cord that appear to represent ectopic neurons ( Figure 3A , A\u2032 ) . Based on their dorsal midline location , we hypothesized that these clusters might arise from neural crest ( NC ) cells that had failed to migrate from their origin in the dorsal neural tube . To test this hypothesis , we asked whether cells in these clusters express transcription factors characteristic of NC derivatives . For example , Sox10 expression is detected in migrating NC cells and persists in melanocytes and a subset of dorsal root ganglion ( DRG ) neurons , and Brn3a and Islet1/2 are expressed in postmigratory DRG sensory neurons ( Marmig\u00e8re and Ernfors , 2007; Sauka-Spengler and Bronner-Fraser , 2008; Bhatt et al . , 2013 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 01482 . 007Figure 3 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 01482 . 007 As shown in Figure 3B\u2013C\u2032\u2032 , almost all of the cells in the NF-rich clusters express Sox10 , Brn3a , or Islet1/2 , consistent with a NC origin . Interestingly , Sox10 and Brn3a are expressed in mutually exclusive subsets of cells , as are Sox10 and Islet1/2 , suggesting that despite their migratory defect , these presumptive NC cells are able to differentiate along appropriate committed lineages . Furthermore , Sox10 and NF immunolabeling within the dorsal clusters appear to be mutually exclusive or nearly so ( Figure 3E\u2032\u2032 , F\u2032\u2032 ) , suggesting that at E11 . 5 the dorsal clusters consist of two classes of cells: immature NC cells at the migratory stage ( Sox10+/NF-/Brn3a\u2212/Islet1/2\u2212 ) and more mature NC cells that are differentiating as DRG neurons ( Sox10\u2212/NF+/Brn3a+/Islet1/2+ ) . These observations suggest that NC cell differentiation can proceed in the absence of cell migration , and that these dorsal clusters could serve as a useful model for dissecting extrinsic vs intrinsic influences on NC cell specification . We further observed that both the number and average size of the dorsal clusters decreased from E11 . 5 to E12 . 5 and they completely disappeared by \u223cE14 . 5 , suggesting that the ectopic cells undergo programmed cell death . As shown in Figure 3D\u2013F\u2032\u2032 , at E11 . 5 many cells in the dorsal clusters contain activated Caspase3 , especially those that are Sox10\u2212/NF+ . Activated Caspase3 is largely absent from Sox10+/NF\u2212 cells . Apparently the more differentiated DRG-like dorsal cluster neurons are the first to undergo apoptotic cell death , and the less differentiated NC derivatives are temporarily spared that fate . In the lumbar region of E11 . 5 Fz3\u2212/\u2212 embryos , there is a \u223c0 . 5 day delay in the appearance of apoptotic neurons within the DRG , as determined by immunostaining for activated Caspase3 , relative to Fz3+/\u2212 littermates ( compare Figure 3D , D\u2032 vs Figure 3E , E\u2032 ) . This delay in apoptotic death among DRG neurons is not observed in the cervical region of E11 . 5 Fz3\u2212/\u2212 embryos , which is devoid of dorsal clusters . In DRGs , NC cells differentiate into neurons in greater numbers than are required for full target innervation , and the resulting competition for target-derived survival factors leads to the death of excess neurons ( Oppenheim , 1991; Cowan , 2001 ) . Since apoptotic cell death in WT DRGs is well underway by E11 . 5 , when most DRG axons are still far from their final targets , it is likely that intermediate targets are a major source of survival signals . The similar distributions along the spinal cord of dorsal clusters and delayed apoptosis suggested the possibility that in the lumber region of Fz3\u2212/\u2212 embryos there may be an initial reduction in the number of NC cells arriving at the DRG , leading to decreased competition for peripheral targets and higher rates of survival of DRG neurons . In light of the essential role of Fz3 in the development of subsets of cranial motor neurons , we evaluated the role of Fz3 in the development of spinal motor neurons that innervate the limbs , a set for which the axonal projection patterns have been well defined ( De Marco Garcia and Jessell , 2008; Bonanomi and Pfaff , 2010 ) . NF immunostaining of E11 . 5-E13 . 5 limbs showed that the nerve innervating the dorsal limb is moderately thinned in Fz3\u2212/\u2212 forelimbs and moderately to severely thinned in Fz3\u2212/\u2212 hindlimbs ( Figure 4A\u2013H\u2032 , and Figure 4\u2014figure supplements 1 and 2 ) . In the hindlimb , roughly 50% of Fz3\u2212/\u2212 embryos exhibit a moderate defect , with a thinned dorsal nerve that is still visible along its distal trajectory . The remaining \u223c50% of Fz3\u2212/\u2212 embryos exhibit a severe defect , with a near absence of the dorsal nerve . Other nerves within the limb appear to be largely unaffected . 10 . 7554/eLife . 01482 . 008Figure 4 . Thinning of the dorsal motor nerve in Fz3\u2212/\u2212 limbs .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 01482 . 011 To ascertain the motor vs sensory identity of the affected axons , we crossed the Hb9-EGFP transgene to Fz3 mutant mice to selectively label motor axons . GFP immunostaining of Hb9-EGFP;Fz3+/+ and Hb9-EGFP;Fz3\u2212/\u2212 limbs at E12 . 5 showed that motor axons are severely under-represented in the dorsal nerve in both fore- and hindlimbs in mutant embryos ( Figure 4I\u2013L\u2032\u2032 ) . The affected axons derive from motor neurons in the lateral division of the lateral motor column ( LMCL; Figure 4A ) . Close examination of the pattern of NF immunostaining showed that the Fz3\u2212/\u2212 defect occurs distal to the point where LMC axons separate into dorsal and ventral nerves . More specifically , in Fz3\u2212/\u2212 limbs an abrupt decrease in diameter is observed in the dorsal nerve immediately distal to the emergence of its first major side branch ( Figure 4B\u2032\u2013H\u2032 , M ) . Therefore , the defect in the Fz3\u2212/\u2212 limb appears to be a stalling of LMCL axons at this location . To quantify this phenotype , we measured the thickness of the dorsal nerve proximal and distal to this point . We also measured the thickness of the ventral nerve at the same distance from the plexus ( Figure 4M ) . All measurements were made on NF-immunostained whole-mount limbs viewed in a dorsal-to-ventral orientation . Figure 4N shows the quantification of nerve thickness for fore- and hindlimbs among littermates in two E12 . 5 litters and one E13 . 5 litter . In Figure 4N , moderate and severe phenotypes within the hindlimb are represented by distinct symbols , but the statistical analysis ignores this distinction and simply compares Fz3+/\u2212 and Fz3+/+ vs Fz3\u2212/\u2212 littermates . For both the fore- and hindlimbs in Fz3\u2212/\u2212 embryos , several findings emerge: ( 1 ) the thinning of the dorsal nerve is highly significant statistically and it occurs over a remarkably small interval , between the regions labeled DProximal and DDistal in Figure 4M; ( 2 ) proximal to position DProximal , dorsal nerve thinning is minimal and statistically insignificant; ( 3 ) the ventral nerve exhibits a small decrease in thickness in 5/6 comparisons , with 4/6 showing a difference that is statistically significant ( p<0 . 05 ) , implying that dorsal nerve axons have not rerouted to the ventral nerve , which would have then shown an increase in thickness; and ( 4 ) the average nerve thickness , relative to the littermate controls , is 31% for the dorsal nerve in the hindlimb , 57% for the dorsal nerve in the forelimb , and 82% for the ventral nerve when averaged over fore- and hindlimbs . In Fz3\u2212/\u2212 embryos , other classes of spinal motor axons appear to be unaffected , including medial motor column and hypaxial motor column axons that innervate axial muscles and body wall muscles , respectively ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3 ) . Although Fz3 is widely expressed in the mouse spinal cord and brainstem , it appears to be uniquely required by only a subset of motor neurons . We next asked whether the primary cause of motor axon deficiency in the VIIth , XIIth , phrenic , and dorsal limb nerves in Fz3\u2212/\u2212 mice is: ( 1 ) defective motor neuron differentiation , ( 2 ) excessive motor neuron death , or ( 3 ) defective axon growth and/or guidance . Since the vast majority of Fz3\u2212/\u2212 motor axons do not appear to follow erroneous trajectories ( Figures 1A , A\u2032 , and 4 ) , aberrant path-finding is unlikely to be relevant . There are also no apparent defects in motor axon fasciculation in Fz3\u2212/\u2212 embryos ( Figures 1 and 4 ) . To distinguish among the remaining possibilities , we focused on LMCL motor neurons and their axons , because ( 1 ) these neurons can be unambiguously identified based on their patterns of transcription factor expression; ( 2 ) their axons can be clearly identified within the limb; and ( 3 ) several signaling pathways that control LMCL axon growth and guidance decisions provide points of comparison . In the developing mouse spinal cord , postmitotic motor neurons are generated between E9 and E11 ( Arber et al . , 1999 ) . Motor neurons are divided into pools positioned at stereotypical locations along the rostrocaudal , dorsoventral , and mediolateral axes of the spinal cord . Each motor pool innervates specific peripheral targets and can be characterized by the expression of various transcription factors ( Bonanomi and Pfaff , 2010 ) . For example , Islet1 is expressed by LMCM motor neurons and Lhx1 is expressed by LMCL motor neurons , while Islet2 and Foxp1 are pan-LMC markers ( Figure 5A ) . By using Islet1 and Foxp1 double immunostaining on cross sections from E11 . 5 lumbar-level spinal cords we observed that the LMCL pool ( Foxp1+/Islet1\u2212 ) is present in Fz3\u2212/\u2212 mice ( Figure 5B , B\u2032 ) . This result implies that Fz3 is not required for the initial specification of LMCL motor neurons . 10 . 7554/eLife . 01482 . 012Figure 5 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 01482 . 013 To quantitatively assess motor neuron populations at a time when the Fz3\u2212/\u2212 phenotype is fully manifest , we counted the number of LMCL neurons in serial cross sections from E12 . 5 lumbar-level spinal cords following Islet1 and Foxp1 immunostaining of three pairs of control and Fz3\u2212/\u2212 littermate embryos . As both LMCM and LMCL neurons were counted in the same sections , the number of LMCM neurons served as an internal control . As shown in Figure 5C , C\u2032 , in the region of the Fz3\u2212/\u2212 spinal cord that contains LMCL neurons , the number of LMCL neurons was significantly decreased , while the number of LMCM neurons was similar to that in Fz3+/\u2212 controls ( sections 1\u20136 ) . In contrast , the numbers of both LMCM and LMCL neurons in more rostral regions were unaffected by loss of Fz3 ( sections 7\u201312 ) . The decrease in LMCL neurons at E12 . 5 suggests that loss of Fz3 could lead\u2014directly or indirectly\u2014to LMCL motor neuron death . To test this possibility , we performed cleaved Caspase3 immunostaining on lumbar spinal cord sections from embryos at E11 . 5 and E12 . 5 , developmental stages prior to the wave of naturally occurring motor neuron death at E13 . 5-E15 . 5 ( Kablar and Rudnicki , 1999; Oppenheim et al . , 2000 ) . As expected , very few apoptotic cells were observed in Fz3+/\u2212 controls at E11 . 5 and E12 . 5 . In contrast , massive cell death is seen in the region corresponding to the LMC in the brachial and lumbar regions of the Fz3\u2212/\u2212 spinal cord ( Figure 5D\u2013E\u2032\u2032 and Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013D\u2032\u2032 ) . By E12 . 5 the lumbar LMC volume is substantially smaller in Fz3\u2212/\u2212 compared with Fz3+/\u2212 spinal cords ( Figure 5F\u2013G\u2032\u2032 ) . Similarly , in the VIIth and XIIth cranial nerve nuclei at E12 . 5 , there is an analogous wave of precocious motor neuron death that is not observed in Fz3+/\u2212 controls ( Figure 5H\u2013K\u2032 ) . Thus , in Fz3\u2212/\u2212 embryos a discrete subset of motor neurons exhibits both axon growth defects and apoptotic cell death at E11 . 5-E12 . 5 . The results thus far indicate that Fz3 inactivation could lead either to a primary defect in motor neuron viability that secondarily impairs axonal growth or a primary defect in axonal growth that secondarily impairs motor neuron viability . To distinguish these two possibilities , we used a Bax\u2212/\u2212 background\u2014in which loss of the proapoptotic molecule Bax largely eliminates apoptosis of motor neurons ( White et al . , 1998 ) \u2014to ask whether blocking ( or delaying ) motor neuron apoptosis rescues the Fz3\u2212/\u2212 dorsal nerve defect . Although the precocious motor neuron death seen in Fz3\u2212/\u2212 embryos was eliminated in Bax\u2212/\u2212;Fz3\u2212/\u2212 embryos , the dorsal nerve defect at the base of the limbs remained unchanged ( Figure 5M\u2013R\u2032 and Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1E\u2013G\u2032\u2032\u2032 ) . Taken together , these data imply that in spinal motor neurons the primary phenotype resulting from loss of Fz3 is a defect in the growth of LMCL axons . Since apoptosis is restricted to precisely those motor neurons that exhibit defective axonal growth and since the axonal growth defect is not secondary to apoptosis of LMCL neurons , it seems very likely that the chain of causality leads from the axonal growth defect to apoptosis . We next asked whether the axonal phenotypes in Fz3\u2212/\u2212 embryos reflect Fz3 action exclusively in CNS neurons . Based on the pattern of lacZ reporter expression from the original Fz3 null allele ( which carries an in-frame lacZ open reading frame ) , Fz3 expression appears to be far higher in the CNS than in other tissues ( Wang et al . , 2002 ) . However , rigorously answering this question requires selective inactivation of Fz3 in defined cell populations . To that end , we generated a Fz3 conditional allele ( Fz3CKO ) , in which LoxP sites flank exon 3 , the largest coding exon , within the Fz3 gene ( Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A , B ) . Following Cre-mediated recombination , the exon 3-deleted allele behaves as a null ( data not shown ) . To eliminate Fz3 expression exclusively in CNS neurons , we controlled recombination with an Olig2Cre knock-in allele and found that Olig2Cre/+;Fz3CKO/\u2212 mice exhibit the complete spectrum of motor neuron phenotypes shown by Fz3\u2212/\u2212 mice: ( 1 ) VIIth nerve axons do not form the well-defined C-shaped tract looping around the VIth cranial nerve nucleus ( Figure 6A , A\u2032 ) ; ( 2 ) the XIIth cranial nerve is markedly thinned and fails to innervate the tongue at E13 . 5 ( Figure 6B\u2013C\u2032 ) ; ( 3 ) the phrenic nerve is thinned ( Figure 6D , D\u2032 ) ; and ( 4 ) the dorsal nerves innervating the fore- and hindlimbs are thinned ( Figure 6E\u2013H\u2032 ) . This experiment rules out any role for Fz3 in peripheral tissues . Fz3 expression in DRG neurons also appears to be irrelevant since Olig2Cre is not expressed in DRG neurons ( Huettl et al . , 2011; Chen and Wichterle , 2012 ) , a conclusion that was further confirmed by inactivating the Fz3CKO allele specifically in DRG neurons with a Wnt1-Cre transgene ( Wnt1-Cre;Fz3CKO/\u2212; Danielian et al . , 1998 ) and observing that the dorsal nerves innervating the fore- and hindlimbs were unaffected ( Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1C\u2013D\u2032 ) . These data imply that the LMCL motor axon defect is not an indirect consequence of Fz3-dependent effects on co-fasciculating sensory axons . 10 . 7554/eLife . 01482 . 014Figure 6 .

To circumvent this problem , we combined a Caudal-1 ( Cdx1 ) -Cre transgene with the Fz3CKO allele to inactivate Fz3 in all tissues caudal to the upper thorax before midgestation ( Hierholzer and Kemler , 2009 ) . The postnatal viability of Cdx1-Cre;Fz3CKO/\u2212 mice implies that structures critical for breathing and feeding develop normally .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 01482 . 017 Cdx1-Cre;Fz3CKO/\u2212 mice ambulate primarily with their forelimbs , which appear to be grossly normal , suggesting that the moderate thinning of the dorsal nerve in the forelimb does not seriously compromise innervation of the musculature . In cross sections of distal hind legs in Hb9-EGFP;Fz3\u2212/\u2212 embryos at E15 . 5 , we observed a selective loss of motor innervation of the muscles of the anterior compartment ( tibialis anterior , extensor hallucis longus , and extensor digitorum longus muscles ) by the deep peroneal nerve ( Figure 7F , F\u2032 ) , and in adult Cdx1-Cre;Fz3CKO/\u2212 mice this same group of muscles is selectively and completely atrophied as determined by magnetic resonance imaging ( Figure 7G , G\u2032 ) . The severe plantar flexion of Fz3\u2212/\u2212 and Cdx1-Cre;Fz3CKO/\u2212 hindfeet is readily understood from the anatomy of the limb musculature and its innervation ( Gray and Lewis , 1918 ) . The dorsal muscles in the embryonic limb become extensors and abductors , which are innervated by the peroneal nerve , while the ventral muscles become flexors and adductors , which are innervated by the tibial nerve . After the developing hindlimb undergoes a 90-degree rotation\u2014which rotates the plantar surface of the foot away from the midline\u2014the dorsal limb muscles face anteriorly and ventral limb muscles face posteriorly . Failure of dorsal nerve development affects muscles in the anterior compartment , which dorsiflex the foot . As a result , the normal balance between antagonistic flexor and extensor muscle groups is lost , and the action of the unopposed extensors leads to extreme plantar flexion of the foot . As noted in the Introduction , defects in motor axon guidance in the dorsal limb have been described in EphA4\u2212/\u2212 , Gdnf\u2212/\u2212 , and Ret\u2212/\u2212 embryos , and in each case dorsal motor axons are misrouted to the ventral limb . To compare one example of this class of mutants side-by-side with Fz3\u2212/\u2212 and to examine the possibility of a genetic interaction between the Fz3 and the GDNF/Ret signaling pathways , we examined limb innervation phenotypes in Ret\u2212/\u2212 , Fz3+/\u2212;Ret+/\u2212 , and Fz3\u2212/\u2212;Ret+/\u2212 embryos ( Figure 7H\u2013J\u2032 ) . This analysis provides no evidence for a genetic interaction between Fz3 and Ret , as Fz3+/\u2212;Ret+/\u2212 hindlimb innervation is indistinguishable from WT , and Fz3\u2212/\u2212;Ret+/\u2212 hindlimb innervation is indistinguishable from Fz3\u2212/\u2212 ( compare Figures 4B\u2013F\u2032 and 7H\u2013J\u2032 , Figure 4\u2014figure supplements 1 and 2 , and Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013C\u2032 ) . Our analysis of Ret\u2212/\u2212 fore- and hindlimb innervation fully confirms previous descriptions ( Kramer et al . , 2006 ) and shows that in Ret\u2212/\u2212 hindlimbs the dorsal nerve is thinned to a similar extent both proximal and distal to the point at which Fz3\u2212/\u2212 dorsal motor axons stall ( asterisks in Figure 7H\u2032\u2013J\u2032 ) and the ventral nerve is thicker than its counterpart in WT littermates , consistent with a rerouting of dorsal motor axons to the ventral nerve . These experiments confirm that the Fz3\u2212/\u2212 dorsal motor axon phenotype is anatomically distinct from the phenotypes described in EphA4\u2212/\u2212 , Gdnf\u2212/\u2212 , and Ret\u2212/\u2212 limbs ( Figure 7K ) . \n Of technical interest is our use of Cre-mediated recombination in the caudal \u223c80% of the embryo as a strategy for studying genes that are required more rostrally for survival ( e . g . , genes required for brain development ) . The Cdx1-Cre transgene used here recombines LoxP targets at \u223c100% efficiency by \u223cE8 in all solid tissues caudal to the upper thorax ( Hierholzer and Kemler , 2009 ) . A Cdx2-Cre transgene produces a similar pattern of recombination except that the most rostral extent of recombination is located roughly at the umbilicus ( Hinoi et al . , 2007 ) . Thus , mice harboring a conditional allele that impairs cardiac or pulmonary function would likely be spared if the allele was recombined with the Cdx2-Cre transgene . These two Cre lines should be generally useful for studying spinal cord , DRG , and peripheral nerve phenotypes in postnatal mice harboring conditional alleles in a wide variety of genes . NC cell migration is one of the most dramatic migration processes in vertebrate development . At mid-gestation , NC cells delaminate from the dorsal neuro-ectoderm to populate skin ( melanocytes ) , viscera ( sympathetic , parasympathetic , and enteric neurons ) , DRGs ( somatosensory neurons ) , the adrenal medulla , and a variety of mesenchymal structures in the head ( Dupin et al . , 2006 ) . Genetic defects in melanocyte and enterocyte migration have been extensively studied in mice and humans where they produce easily recognized phenotypes , such as skin depigmentation and aganglionic colon ( Waardenberg disease and Hirschprung disease; Gershon , 2010 ) . Migration of enteric neurons requires endothelin3/endothelin receptor B and GDNF/Ret signaling . In various experimental contexts , cadherins , integrins , and Eph/Ephrins have also been found to influence NC migration ( McKeown et al . , 2013 ) . Our observation that Fz3 promotes the initial step in NC migration represents a new connection between PCP signaling and NC migration . Fz3\u2212/\u2212 embryos also exhibit subtle defects in the migration of monoaminergic neurons ( Fenstermaker et al . , 2010 ) and more severe defects in the migration of VIIth cranial nerve neurons ( Qu et al . , 2010 ) , but , in general , neuronal migration defects are not a prominent feature of the Fz3\u2212/\u2212 phenotype . At E11 . 5 , a time when only a small fraction of cells within the DRG are dying , the non-migratory NC-derived neuron clusters in Fz3\u2212/\u2212 embryos show a high density of apoptotic cells . Whether cell death is triggered directly by the failure of cell migration or is a secondary consequence of migratory failure\u2014for example , as a result of incorrect routing of axons produced by neurons within the clusters\u2014it represents an impressive demonstration of the rapidity and efficiency with which the developing nervous system recognizes and eliminates errors . In this respect , it bears a conceptual , and possibly a mechanistic , resemblance to the rapid elimination of the Fz3\u2212/\u2212 LMCL neurons with stalled axons . Axon stalling has been observed in diverse systems either as part of the normal pattern of axon outgrowth or as a phenotypic consequence of mutation . In the first category are the \u223c1 day waiting period during which sensory and motor axons stall at the base of the developing chick hindlimb ( Wang and Scott , 2000 ) and the alternating phases of stalling and growth that characterize motor axon path-finding in C . elegans ( Knobel et al . , 1999 ) . In the second category are the stalling phenotypes observed among sensory neurons in Drosophila embryos carrying mutations in the Neuroglian gene ( Nrg; Martin et al . , 2008 ) or in the gene coding for the PCP protein Flamingo ( Fmi; the Drosophila orthologue of the mammalian Celsr genes; Steinel and Whitington , 2009 ) , among spinal motor axons in zebrafish carrying collagen XIX mutations ( Beattie et al . , 2000; Hilario et al . , 2010 ) , and among post-crossing commissural axons in the spinal cord in mouse Robo1 mutants ( Jaworski et al . , 2010 ) . Although the mechanistic link between extra-cellular signals or adhesive interactions and axon stalling has not been defined for any of these examples , a potentially unifying framework has emerged from studies of the relationship between calcium transients and growth cone motility . Within growth cones , calcium release and motility are inversely correlated , with rapidly moving growth cones showing the lowest frequency calcium transients and stalled or retracting growth cones showing the highest frequency calcium transients ( Gomez and Spitzer , 1999 ) . In the present study , the loss of Fz3 blocks growth but does not alter path-finding among dorsal limb motor axons , and therefore presents as a pure stalling phenotype . However , we note that the conceptualization of axon growth and path-finding as distinct behaviors may be simplistic , since the two attributes could be related mechanistically if axon growth is dependent on the same signals that guide the path-finding process . During normal embryonic development , motor axons compete for limited quantities of survival factors produced by their skeletal muscle targets , with the result that in the prenatal mouse >50% of motor neurons die beginning at E13 . 5 ( Oppenheim , 1991; Sendtner et al . , 2000 ) . Among Fz3\u2212/\u2212 LMCL neurons , a wave of cell death begins at E11 . 5 , well before LMCL axons have reached their final muscle targets , and 2 days before the normal wave of motor neuron cell death ( Kablar and Rudnicki , 1999; Oppenheim et al . , 2000 ) . The precocious motor neuron death in Fz3\u2212/\u2212 embryos is unlikely to reflect survival factors derived from skeletal muscle because even in the complete absence of skeletal myoblasts , myofibers , and muscle\u2014a phenotype produced in Myf5\u2212/\u2212;MyoD\u2212/\u2212 embryos\u2014motor neuron cell death does not occur prior to E13 . 5 ( Kablar and Rudnicki , 1999 ) . Taken together , the Fz3\u2212/\u2212 and Myf5\u2212/\u2212;MyoD\u2212/\u2212 phenotypes imply that motor neuron survival between E11 . 5 and E13 . 5 is an active process and is independent of the motor axon\u2019s ultimate target . One class of models that could account for the precocious motor neuron death in Fz3\u2212/\u2212 embryos invokes the existence of neuronal survival factors produced by intermediate targets along an axon\u2019s trajectory , as suggested by in vitro co-culture experiments with spinal cord commissural axons and floor plate tissue ( Wang and Tessier-Lavigne , 1999 ) . The Fz3\u2212/\u2212 experiments reported here provide in vivo evidence for this model , and suggest that the hypothesized survival factor ( s ) reside distal to the plexus but proximal to the developing muscle target . We note that alternative models are also consistent with the data , including , for example , the possibility of anti-survival signals at the point of Fz3\u2212/\u2212 axon stalling . While the precocious cell death of Fz3\u2212/\u2212 motor neurons can be rescued by eliminating Bax , the axon stalling phenotype remains unchanged . This observation is consistent with a model in which a defect in Fz3-dependent axonal growth induces apoptotic cell death , and it argues against an alternate model in which Fz3 functions in some other process to maintain cell viability , with defective axonal growth representing a secondary effect of the neuron\u2019s impending demise . A corollary to this argument is that controlling axonal growth may be the only function of Fz3 in motor neurons . In earlier work , Fz3\u2212/\u2212 , and Celsr3\u2212/\u2212 forebrains were found to have essentially identical defects in multiple axon tracts ( Wang et al . , 2002 , 2006b; Tissir et al . , 2005 ) , and in Fz3\u2212/\u2212 , Celsr3\u2212/\u2212 , and Vangl2Lp/Lp spinal cords the commissural axons of dorsal horn sensory neurons were found to exhibit the same rostral turning defect ( Lyuksyutova et al . , 2003; Tissir et al . , 2005; Price et al . , 2006; Shafer et al . , 2011 ) . The present work strongly suggests that , in the context of motor axon growth and guidance , Fz3 and one or more Celsr family members are also likely to act together in the same pathway . In a wide variety of epithelia , planar cell polarity proteins are arranged in asymmetric cell surface complexes ( Simons and Mlodzik , 2008; Goodrich and Strutt , 2011 ) . At the junctions between adjacent cells , the large cadherin-containing Stan/Fmi/Celsr proteins accumulate at the plasma membranes of both cells and are presumed to form homophilic adhesive interactions . By contrast , Frizzled proteins accumulate at the plasma membrane of one cell and Vang/Stan/Vangl proteins accumulate at the plasma membrane of the opposing cell . The general assumption in the field is that the asymmetric distribution of Frizzled and Vangl proteins is a prerequisite for transmitting polarity information within the plane of the epithelium ( Goodrich and Strutt , 2011; Peng and Axelrod , 2012 ) . The current conceptual framework appears well suited to explain signal transmission via cell surface complexes of PCP proteins within relatively stable epithelial monolayers . This framework can also accommodate more dynamic situations in which epithelial cells divide or exchange partners on time scales of minutes to tens of minutes , as seen , for example , during convergent extension movements . Although the dynamics of PCP protein complexes remains largely undefined , one study of their trafficking during the cell cycle shows that these complexes can dis-assemble and reassemble on a time scale of tens of minutes ( Devenport et al . , 2011 ) . The axonal development phenotypes produced by loss of Fz3 or Celsr3 raise an apparent paradox if we imagine that Fz3 and Celsr3 sense and integrate environmental information to control axonal growth by forming the same type of cell-surface complexes in growth cones\u2014and , in particular , in growth cone filopodia\u2014as they do in epithelia . Such a scenario would imply that the time scales of assembly and dis-assembly of PCP protein complexes and engagement with and disengagement from partners in the environment would need to occur on the time scale of growth cone dynamics , that is seconds to tens of seconds ( Schaefer et al . , 2002 ) . At present , the subcellular location of endogenous PCP proteins in developing neurons has not been determined . However , experiments with dissociated commissural neurons that express transfected Fz3 or Vangl2 tagged with fluorescent reporters show that Fz3 is enriched in intracellular vesicles and Vangl2 is localized throughout the growth cone plasma membrane with the highest concentration in filopodia ( Shafer et al . , 2011 ) . While current models of PCP protein action in growth cones are necessarily speculative , the axon growth phenotypes suggest that the signaling repertoire of PCP proteins is more diverse than would be predicted from considerations based only on epithelia . These and other Frizzled and Celsr phenotypes suggest that \u2018tissue polarity\u2019 , the original name for the signals sent and received by this pathway , might be more apt than the epithelium-centric name \u2018planar cell polarity\u2019 . \n The Fz3CKO allele was generated by homologous recombination in mouse embryonic stem ( ES ) cells using standard techniques . The targeting construct contained exon 3 with 3 . 4 kb of 5\u2032 and 6 . 4 kb of 3\u2032 flanking intronic sequences . An HA epitope was inserted in the linker region that connects the cysteine-rich ligand-binding domain and the first transmembrane domain ( a region encoded in the third exon ) . A neomycin phosphotransferase ( neo ) selection marker with flanking Frt sites was inserted 3\u2032 of exon 3 , and LoxP sites were placed 5\u2032 of exon 3 and 3\u2032 of neo ( Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A ) . The targeting construct was electroporated into R1 mouse ES cells , and colonies were grown in medium containing G418 and ganclovir . Colonies were screened by Southern blot hybridization , and positive clones were injected into C57BL/6 blastocysts to generate chimeric founders . Germline transmission was confirmed by Southern blot hybridization and PCR . The neo cassette was removed by crossing to germline Flp mice ( Rodriguez et al . , 2000 ) . The following mouse lines were also used: Fz3\u2212/\u2212 ( Wang et al . , 2002 ) , Bax\u2212/\u2212 ( Knudson et al . , 1995 ) , R26iAP ( Badea et al . , 2009 ) , Hb9-EGFP ( Wichterle et al . , 2002 ) , ChAT-IRES-Cre ( JAX #006410; The Jackson Laboratory , Bar Harbor , ME ) , Olig2Cre ( i . e . , a Cre knock-in at the Olig2 locus; Dessaud et al . , 2007 ) , Wnt1-Cre ( Danielian et al . , 1998 ) , and Cdx1-Cre ( Hierholzer and Kemler , 2009 ) . Throughout this work , the first day after finding a copulation plug was counted as embryonic day 0 . 5 ( E0 . 5 ) . For the analysis of E18 . 5 embryos , skinned heads were immersion fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde ( PFA ) at 4\u00b0C overnight with gentle shaking , washed three times in phosphate buffered saline ( PBS ) , pH 7 . 4 , and then decalcified in 50 mM EDTA , pH 7 . 0 at 4\u00b0C for 1 week . Heads were embedded in 3% low melting point agarose in PBS and sectioned at 200 \u00b5m on a vibratome . AP histochemistry was performed essentially as previously described ( Badea et al . , 2003 ) . Sections were washed twice in PBS with 2 mM MgCl2 , heated in a water bath at 69\u00b0C for 90 min to inactivate endogenous AP activity , and then equilibrated in AP staining buffer ( 0 . 1 M Tris , 0 . 1 M NaCl , 50 mM MgCl2 , pH 9 . 5 ) . AP histochemistry were carried out in AP staining buffer containing 0 . 34 \u00b5g/ml 4-nitro blue tetrazolium chloride ( NBT ) and 0 . 175 \u00b5g/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-phosphate ( BCIP ) ( Roche Applied Science; Indianapolis , IN ) , for 1 hr to overnight at room temperature with gentle horizontal rotation . Before imaging , sections were dehydrated through an ethanol series and then cleared with BBBA [2:1 benzyl benzoate ( BB ) /benzyl alcohol ( BA ) ] ( Sigma-Aldrich; St . Louis , MO ) . The following primary antibodies were used: mouse monoclonal anti-Neurofilament ( 165 kDa ) ( 2H3; Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank [DSHB]; Iowa City , IA ) , mouse monoclonal anti-Islet1 ( 39 . 3F7; DSHB ) , mouse monoclonal anti-Islet1/2 ( 39 . 4D5; DSHB ) , rabbit anti-Brn3a ( MAB1585; Millipore; Billerica , MA ) , rabbit anti-Caspase3 ( 9661; Cell Signaling Technology; Boston , MA ) , rabbit anti-Foxp1 ( ab16645; Abcam; Cambridge , MA ) , rabbit anti-GFP ( A11122; Invitrogen; Grand Island , NY ) , goat anti-Sox10 ( SC-17342; Santa Cruz Biotechnology; Dallas , TX ) , rabbit anti-Islet1 , anti-Islet2 , and anti-Islet1/2 ( gifts of Dr Tom Jessell and Susan Morton; Columbia University ) . Secondary antibodies were Alexa Fluor 488 , Alexa Fluor 594 , or Alexa Fluor 647 conjugated , donkey anti-goat , goat anti-mouse , or goat anti-rabbit IgG antibodies ( Invitrogen ) . Alexa Fluor 647 \u03b1-Bungarotoxin ( B35450; Invitrogen ) was used to label acetylcholine receptors . Immunostaining was performed on ( 1 ) embryos that were either ( a ) immersion fixed in 4% PFA at 4\u00b0C for 1 hr , washed three times in cold PBS , equilibrated in PBS containing 30% sucrose , embedded in optimal cutting temperature ( OCT ) compound ( Sakura Finetek; Torrance , CA ) , frozen , and sectioned at 14 \u00b5m on a cryostat; or ( b ) immersion fixed in 4% PFA at 4\u00b0C overnight , washed three times in cold PBS , embedded in 3% low melting point agarose , and sectioned at 100 \u00b5m or 700 \u00b5m on a vibratome; and ( 2 ) whole-mount embryos and limbs that were immersion fixed in 4% PFA at 4\u00b0C for 2 hr and washed three times in cold PBS . For immunostaining of cryosections , sections were rinsed in PBS three times , blocked in PBST ( PBS with 0 . 3% Triton X-100 ) containing 5% normal goat or donkey serum ( NGS or NDS ) at room temperature for 1 hr , and incubated with primary antibodies in PBST containing 5% NGS or NDS at 4\u00b0C overnight . Sections were then washed three times in PBS , and incubated with secondary antibodies in PBST containing 5% NGS or NDS at room temperature for 1 hr . Finally sections were washed three times in PBS , and slides were mounted with Fluoromount-G ( Southern Biotech; Birmingham , AL ) . For immunostaining of 100 \u00b5m-thick vibratome sections , sections were blocked in PBST containing 5% NGS or NDS at room temperature for 1 hr , and incubated with primary antibodies in PBST containing 5% NGS or NDS at 4\u00b0C overnight . Sections were then washed five times in PBST , and incubated with secondary antibodies in PBST containing 5% NGS or NDS at 4\u00b0C overnight . Finally sections were washed five times in PBST , and sections were mounted on slides with Fluoromount-G . For immunostaining of 700 \u00b5m-thick vibratome sections or whole-mount embryos and limbs , samples were first incubated in Dent\u2019s Bleach ( 10% H2O2 , 13 . 3% dimethyl sulfoxide [DMSO] , 53 . 3% methanol ) at 4\u00b0C for 24 hr , washed in methanol five times , and fixed in Dent\u2019s Fix ( 20% DMSO , 80% methanol ) at 4\u00b0C overnight . Samples were washed in PBS three times , incubated with primary antibody in blocking solution ( 20% DMSO , 75% PBST , 5% NGS , 0 . 025% sodium azide ) at room temperature for 5 days to one week with gentle end-over-end rotation , and then washed five times in PBST . Samples were incubated with secondary antibody in blocking solution at room temperature for 2 days with gentle end-over-end rotation and then washed five times in PBST . Finally samples were dehydrated in 50% methanol/PBS and methanol , and cleared in BBBA . Immunofluorescent signals are stable for >1 week at room temperature in BBBA , and stained tissue samples can be stored for >3 months in methanol at 4\u00b0C and returned to BBBA with no discernable loss of image quality or signal strength . Samples processed for AP histochemistry were imaged using a Zeiss Stemi V11 microscope with a color Axiocam CCD in combination with Openlab software . Immunostained samples were imaged using a Zeiss LSM700 confocal microscope with Zen software . Images of vibratome-cut thick samples or whole-mounts were acquired with a 10X air objective at 10 \u00b5m intervals in the Z dimension , and the entire Z stack was either collapsed using a maximum intensity projection or color-coded based on depth . Custom built metal and plexiglass embryo holders consisted of a shallow triangular trough ( sides: 2 cm \u00d7 2 cm \u00d7 1 cm; and depths: 1 , 2 , 3 , or 4 mm ) into which the BBBA-cleared embryo could be positioned . The trough was then filled with BBBA , and coverslipped . Imaging a BBBA-cleared E11 . 5 embryo with a 10X objective , a single fluorescent channel , and 10 \u00b5m Z-axis steps generates a \u223c1 . 5 Gb file , which can be acquired in \u223c3 hr on a Zeiss LSM700 confocal microscope . The number of motor neurons on each section was manually quantified in ImageJ . To measure the thickness of nerves innervating the limb , lines perpendicular to and extending across the nerve were drawn at designated sites in Adobe Illustrator and the length of these lines was determined . Statistical comparisons ( student\u2019s t-test ) were performed using GraphPad Prism 5 . P70 Cdx1-Cre;Fz3CKO/\u2212 and control mice from the same litter were fixed by cardiac perfusion .

{"lay_summary": "Much of what is known about genetics has come from studying only a tiny fraction of the genome\u2019s sequence , the part that primarily codes for proteins . But the genome has many other features outside these regions , some of which play an important biological role . Transposable elements \u2013 repetitive sequences that are present in many species \u2013 make up around half of the mouse genome . They are \u2018selfish\u2019 elements , in that the spread of them within the genome does not necessarily benefit the host organism . But sometimes transposable elements can be \u2018domesticated\u2019 , and used to the host\u2019s advantage . For example , transposable elements can generate new genes . In other cases , their non-coding sequences can regulate the activity of other nearby genes or even those elsewhere in the genome . It remains unclear to what extent transposable elements have shaped genome regulation throughout evolution . One idea is that the spread of transposable elements can help to establish large regulatory networks \u2013 whereby many genes are collectively regulated to produce a specific output . But it has not been fully explored how effective transposable elements are at regulating gene expression . Now , Todd et al . investigate whether particular transposable elements , that are suspected to boost the activity of other genes , are essential for normal gene expression in early mouse development . Todd et al . genetically edited stem cells from the inner and outer layer of the early mouse embryo to find transposable elements that promote gene expression . Whilst some transposable elements were found to be important for gene regulation , not all of the candidates tested were needed to maintain expression levels . To widen the search , several transposable elements were turned off simultaneously by compacting specific stretches of DNA so that they could no longer be activated . When 34 transposable elements were inactivated at once , it emerged that only three transposable elements had a significant impact on gene expression . These findings suggest that whether or not a given transposable element regulates gene expression cannot be predicted solely from profiling the structure and sequence of the genome . This highlights why it is important to interrogate the effect transposable elements have ona gene's role within a cell . Transposable elements are largely disregarded in genomics due to technical difficulties in analysing these repetitive stretches of DNA . But characteristic variations within a population may in part be driven by differences in these parts of the genome , which may also be implicated in diseases such as cancer . Identifying which transposable elements are important for driving gene expression , and linking their actions to specific traits could aid the discovery of important genetic variants .", "article": "Transposable elements ( TEs ) are thought to have helped establish gene regulatory networks . Both the embryonic and extraembryonic lineages of the early mouse embryo have seemingly co-opted TEs as enhancers , but there is little evidence that they play significant roles in gene regulation . Here we tested a set of long terminal repeat TE families for roles as enhancers in mouse embryonic and trophoblast stem cells . Epigenomic and transcriptomic data suggested that a large number of TEs helped to establish tissue-specific gene expression programmes . Genetic editing of individual TEs confirmed a subset of these regulatory relationships . However , a wider survey via CRISPR interference of RLTR13D6 elements in embryonic stem cells revealed that only a minority play significant roles in gene regulation . Our results suggest that a subset of TEs are important for gene regulation in early mouse development , and highlight the importance of functional experiments when evaluating gene regulatory roles of TEs . \n Our knowledge of the tissue-specific regulatory landscape of genomes has vastly increased over the last 10 years , thanks in part to large efforts from consortia such as ENCODE and NIH Roadmap ( ENCODE Project Consortium , 2012; Kundaje et al . , 2015 ) . But whilst such mapping efforts have been instrumental in categorising the non-coding genome into different types of biochemical activity , our understanding of the associated functional roles remains limited . One of the grand challenges of the post-ENCODE era has been to ascribe regulatory function to the biochemically active non-coding portion of genomes . This question is particularly pertinent to transposable elements ( TEs ) ( Elliott et al . , 2014; Doolittle and Brunet , 2017 ) , which often display marks of regulatory activity in a species-specific manner ( Jacques et al . , 2013; Carninci , 2014 ) . On one hand , successful TEs are expected to display such active profiles , which serve the selfish interests of TEs but may act neutrally with respect to host fitness . On the other , TEs can be co-opted ( or exapted ) by the host to serve gene regulatory roles , such as alternative promoters or enhancers ( Chuong et al . , 2017 ) . The distinction between these two scenarios relies on approaches that query the causal links between TEs , gene expression and phenotype . Primarily based on epigenomic data , evidence to date suggests that particular TE families have contributed to the evolution of tissue-specific gene regulatory networks in contexts such as early development ( Kunarso et al . , 2010 ) , placentation ( Chuong et al . , 2013 ) , pregnancy ( Lynch et al . , 2011 ) and innate immunity ( Chuong et al . , 2016 ) , amongst others . Transcription factor ( TF ) binding motifs hosted within the regulatory portion of TEs enable their expression in specific tissues ( Sundaram et al . , 2014; Sundaram et al . , 2017 ) , presumably in a manner that enables vertical inheritance of new TE insertions via the germline . In this respect , mammalian preimplantation development is a seemingly well exploited context for TE expansion , driving genetic conflicts with the host , as well as creating opportunities for TE exaptation ( Rodriguez-Terrones and Torres-Padilla , 2018 ) . In the mouse , TE-derived regulatory activity has been implicated at multiple stages of preimplantation development . Namely , MERVL elements become highly activated upon zygotic genome activation and are thought to play a role in the establishment of the 2-cell stage expression programme ( Macfarlan et al . , 2012 ) . Transition from the 2-cell stage and development progression to the blastocyst stage appear to depend on LINE-1 expression ( Jachowicz et al . , 2017; Percharde et al . , 2018 ) . Finally , work from embryonic and trophoblast stem cells ( ESCs and TSCs , respectively ) , suggests a divergence in TE regulatory activity that is concomitant with the separation of the embryonic and extraembryonic lineages at the blastocyst stage ( Kunarso et al . , 2010; Chuong et al . , 2013 ) . In ESCs , TE families such as RLTR13D6 bind key ESC TFs ( e . g . , OCT4 , NANOG ) , whereas a distinct subset ( e . g . , RLTR13D5 ) bind factors essential for the maintenance of the TSC state ( CDX2 , ELF5 , EOMES ) . These elements are enriched for histone marks that are characteristic of distal enhancers and lie near genes that are expressed in the lineages where they are active ( Kunarso et al . , 2010; Chuong et al . , 2013 ) . TE enhancer activity depends on the cooperative action of multiple TFs , whose binding motifs appear to have been already present in the corresponding ancestral TE insertions ( Sundaram et al . , 2017 ) . However , it remains unclear to what extent such lineage-specific TEs are important for maintaining gene expression programmes during preimplantation development . Here we have tested the gene regulatory function of specific TE families in ESCs and TSCs using genetic and epigenetic editing approaches , and compared them with predictions from extensive analyses of epigenomic and transcriptomic data . We identify a number of TEs that are important to drive expression of lineage-specific genes . However , our data suggest that these constitute a minority of all the putative TE-derived enhancers identified through bioinformatic analyses , highlighting the importance of functional tests when assessing the contribution of TEs to gene regulatory networks . \n To identify TEs with putative regulatory potential in embryonic and extraembryonic lineages of the blastocyst ( Figure 1A ) , we focused on a set of TE families that were previously shown to be highly enriched for binding of key TFs in ESCs ( RLTR9 , RLTR13D6 ) ( Kunarso et al . , 2010 ) or TSCs ( RLTR13B , RLTR13D5 ) ( Chuong et al . , 2013 ) . These long terminal repeat ( LTR ) families entered the Muridae lineage within the last\u00a0~12 . 5 million years ( Thybert et al . , 2018 ) , with copy numbers for each subfamily ranging from 35 ( RLTR9A4 ) to 1302 ( RLTR9E ) , according to the Repeatmasker annotation ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A , B ) . The majority of these elements are found as solo LTRs , as judged by the genomic distance , length and arrangement of consecutive LTRs ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C ) . Nonetheless , we identified some putative proviral elements , mainly associated with RLTR9 subfamilies ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C ) . These include MMERVK9C elements ( bearing RLTR9C LTRs ) and MMERVK9E elements ( RLTR9E LTRs ) . For this study we considered all LTR copies , irrespective of their genomic arrangement . Using uniquely aligned reads from publicly available sequencing data ( Supplementary file 1 ) , we selected TEs bearing the hallmarks of enhancer elements , namely open chromatin status ( from ATAC-seq data ) , binding of at least one of three key TFs ( NANOG , OCT4 or SOX2 in ESCs; ELF5 , EOMES or CDX2 in TSCs ) and enrichment for H3K27ac . To stringently rule out gene promoters we excluded TEs enriched for H3K4me3 and/or lying within 500 bp of known mRNA transcriptional start sites . These putative \u2018TE+\u00a0enhancers\u2019 also displayed H3K4me1 marking ( Figure 1B ) and were bound by multiple proteins normally associated with enhancer activity , such as p300 and the Mediator and cohesin complexes ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A ) . This stringent selection led to the identification of 634 TE+\u00a0enhancers in ESCs and 358 in TSCs , which represent respectively 9 . 6% and 13% of all the TE copies in the families considered . To estimate how many TE+\u00a0enhancers are potentially missed due to reduced read mappability , we simulated sequencing reads that produced ChIP-seq peaks at every TE of interest . After remapping , peak detection failed for 597 RLTR13D6/RLTR9 elements and 915 RLTR13D5/RLTR13B elements , raising the possibility that an additional substantial fraction of TEs from these families could harbour enhancer marks . As expected , RLTR13D6/RLTR9 elements only displayed enhancer-like profiles in ESCs and not in TSCs , whereas the reverse was true for RLTR13D5/RLTR13B elements ( Figure 1C ) . To confirm that TE+\u00a0enhancers display a similar lineage asymmetry in vivo and assess the timing of enhancer activation , we analysed two ATAC-seq datasets from pre- and post-implantation embryos ( Wu et al . , 2016; Smith et al . , 2017 ) . We found that 49% and 56% of the identified TE+\u00a0enhancers ( in TSCs and ESCs , respectively ) display open chromatin in vivo at some point in early development , with a subset being already active in preimplantation embryos ( Figure 1D ) . Both ESC and TSC TE+\u00a0enhancers show some asymmetry with respect to their chromatin status in the respective post-implantation lineages ( epiblast and extraembryonic ectoderm ) , but the tissue specificity is more pronounced for TSC TE+\u00a0enhancers ( Figure 1D ) . Following from the above observations and previous findings ( Jacques et al . , 2013 ) , we asked more widely whether TE+\u00a0enhancers displayed tissue-specific open chromatin . For comparison , we also generated a list of \u2018TE- enhancers\u2019 with the same characteristics as TE+\u00a0enhancers ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2B\u2013D ) but that did not overlap any repetitive elements within the Repeatmasker annotation ( yielding 1988 elements in ESCs and 319 in TSCs ) . Strikingly , whilst a substantial proportion of ESC TE- enhancers displayed open chromatin in multiple tissues , TE+\u00a0enhancer activity was far more restricted to ESCs ( Figure 1E ) . Similar results were obtained for TSC enhancers ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3 ) , in line with previous work ( Chuong et al . , 2013 ) . These results suggest that TE+\u00a0enhancers are particularly optimised for activity within their respective early embryonic tissues , possibly through the synergistic action of multiple TF binding events ( Sundaram et al . , 2017 ) . Co-option of TE+\u00a0enhancers may therefore particularly benefit genes that require highly tissue-specific expression . Despite their sequence similarity , only a relatively small fraction of TEs from any given family bear enhancer-like profiles . It was previously suggested that TE enhancer activity in the ESC and TSC contexts is determined by the presence of key TF binding motifs , which have otherwise been mutated in inactive TEs ( Chuong et al . , 2013; Sundaram et al . , 2017 ) . However , it remains unclear whether such motifs are fully determinant of TE enhancer activity . We therefore performed TF motif analyses of TE+\u00a0enhancer sequences . For comparison , we identified TEs from the same families with high read mappability but that did not display enhancer marks , henceforth termed \u2018non-enhancer TEs\u2019 ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A ) . TE+\u00a0enhancers are on average longer than non-enhancer TEs , as expected if deletions remove key TF binding sites ( Figure 2A , B; Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B ) . Nevertheless , there are many non-enhancer TEs that are full-length LTRs , prompting the question of what are the sequence determinants of enhancer activity . Focusing on long LTR elements ( >60% of maximum length for each family ) , we found enrichment of several motifs at TE+\u00a0enhancers ( versus non-enhancer TEs ) . However , no single motif was predictive of enhancer-like profiles ( Figure 2A , B; Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B ) . For example , whilst SOX2 binding motifs were present in nearly all ( 81\u201391% ) RLTR13D6 and RLTR9E TE+\u00a0enhancers , a high proportion ( 48\u201358% ) of non-enhancer TEs also contained this motif . Notably , motifs for other TFs ( ESRRB , KLF4 ) that have been shown to cooperate with SOX2 for RLTR9E enhancer activity ( Sundaram et al . , 2017 ) were present in similar abundance at both enhancer and non-enhancer TEs ( Figure 2A ) . The co-occurrence of multiple TF motifs in the same element was also insufficient to fully predict enhancer-like profiles . For example , elements containing OCT4 , SOX2 and NANOG motifs accounted for 65% of TE+\u00a0enhancers and 21% of non-enhancer TEs in the RLTR13D6 family ( Figure 2B ) , and few RLTR13D5 elements contained all three EOMES , ELF5 and CDX2 motifs ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B ) . We then asked whether TF binding motifs predicted plasmid-based enhancer activity better than they predict enhancer-like chromatin profiles . Using data from a high-throughput reporter assay in ESCs ( Murtha et al . , 2014 ) , we found that SOX2 , OCT4 and NANOG binding motifs were present in only 12\u201330% of TEs with plasmid-based enhancer activity ( Figure 2C ) . This suggests that simple sequence features , such as the motifs considered here , are poor predictors of TE enhancer activity , which is in line with recent findings in human ESC enhancers ( Barakat et al . , 2018 ) . Notably , 64% of RLTR13D6/RLTR9 copies with enhancer activity in the reporter assay did not display an enhancer-like chromatin profile . We therefore asked whether TF binding and chromatin opening at non-enhancer TEs was repressed by chromatin features . As we previously described ( de la Rica et al . , 2016 ) , non-enhancer TEs display higher levels of DNA methylation than TE+\u00a0enhancers ( Figure 2D ) . However , removal of DNA methylation did not lead to increased enhancer activity at non-enhancer TEs , as judged from ATAC-seq and ChIP-seq data from ESCs lacking DNA methylation ( triple knockout of Dnmt1/3a/3b; Figure 2E ) ( Domcke et al . , 2015 ) . Similar results were obtained with data from hypomethylated na\u00efve ESCs ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C ) ( Kim et al . , 2018 ) . Additionally , we found no evidence of other chromatin marks that could be maintaining TE enhancer activity repressed ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1D ) . All together , these data show that TE enhancer capacity appears to behave non-deterministically with respect to TF motifs or repressive chromatin marks . Therefore , whilst chromatin profiling and reporter assays are useful probabilistic indicators of potential enhancer activity , the regulatory action of TEs has to ultimately be tested through molecular manipulations in their genomic environment . To establish correlations between TE+\u00a0enhancer activity and gene expression , studies to date have largely relied on the linear proximity between TEs and genes . This disregards 3D genome conformation , which enables long-range interactions and is not restricted to one-to-one relationships between TEs and genes . We therefore coupled TE+\u00a0enhancers to genes they putatively regulate based on promoter capture Hi-C ( PCHi-C ) data that we recently generated in ESCs and TSCs ( Schoenfelder et al . , 2018 ) . Only 34\u201344% of TE+\u00a0enhancers interacted with at least one gene promoter , which was nonetheless higher than the proportion of non-enhancer TEs with gene promoter interactions ( 21\u201328% , Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A ) . In contrast , a high proportion of TE- enhancers ( 65\u201370% ) interacted with gene promoters . The contrast between TE+\u00a0and TE- enhancers could be explained by the fact that the latter are preferentially positioned within gene-rich , active regions ( known as the \u2018A\u2019 spatial compartment ) , whereas TE+\u00a0enhancers tend to be located within gene-poor , inactive regions ( \u2018B\u2019 compartment; Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B ) . Accordingly , TE+\u00a0enhancers and TE- enhancers interact with largely non-overlapping groups of genes ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C ) . To analyse correlations between enhancers and gene expression , we only considered genes that interact exclusively with TE+\u00a0or TE- enhancers ( Figure 3A ) . For both ESCs and TSCs , we found that TE+\u00a0enhancers interacted with genes that displayed higher expression levels when compared to the genome-wide average or to genes interacting with non-enhancer TEs ( Figure 3B ) . Given the tight tissue specificity of TE+\u00a0enhancer profiles that we described above ( Figure 1E; Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3 ) , we asked whether genes interacting with TE+\u00a0enhancers displayed lineage-specific expression . We first compared their expression in ESCs and TSCs and found a bias towards the cell type where the interacting TEs display enhancer profiles ( Figure 3C ) . In contrast , the expression of genes interacting with TE- enhancers was on average similar between the two cell lineages . To test for tissue specificity more generally , we analysed gene expression levels across a wide array of tissues using data from the ENCODE project . Strikingly , genes interacting with TE+\u00a0enhancers were , on average , almost exclusively expressed in ESCs or TSCs , whereas those interacting with TE- enhancers displayed high expression across a broad range of tissues ( Figure 3D ) . A similar pattern was observed when analysing gene expression at early stages of ESC or TSC differentiation ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . These data are in line with the chromatin accessibility data and suggest that TE+\u00a0enhancers may be used to support lineage-specific expression of a subset of genes in early development . However , it is also possible for the correlations observed here to emerge in the absence of causal links between TEs and gene expression . To directly test for a functional role of TE+\u00a0enhancers in gene regulation , we performed CRISPR-mediated genetic excision of selected TEs . Based on the bioinformatic analyses above , we chose a set of 4 TEs in ESCs and 2 TEs in TSCs that display strong evidence of enhancer activity ( Figure 4A , B; Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . Most genes targeted by these TE+\u00a0enhancers , as predicted from PCHi-C data , had skewed expression towards ESCs or TSCs ( Figure 4D ) . We also selected an element interacting with Smarcad1 , a gene involved in pluripotency maintenance ( Hong et al . , 2009 ) , and one element that was previously shown to regulate Akap12 in ESCs ( Sundaram et al . , 2017 ) . After genetically excising TE+\u00a0enhancers using pairs of sgRNAs ( Figure 4C ) in multiple clones , we measured the effects on the expression of target genes . In TSCs , both TEs tested were found to be key regulators of their predicted target genes , Map3k8 and Scarf2 , as homozygous null clones displayed\u00a0~4-fold reduction in expression ( Figure 4E , F ) . In ESCs , however , only one of the tested TEs had a pronounced effect on the expression of its main target gene ( Figure 4G\u2013J ) . Excision of this particular RLTR13D6 element led to a dramatic\u00a0~8-fold reduction in Tdrd12 expression , and also had minor effects on the expression of other nearby genes that interact with it ( Figure 4G ) . Although the associated TE lies within the first intron of Tdrd12 , we found no evidence that it acted as an alternative promoter in ESCs ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2 ) , supporting its role as an enhancer . Heterozygous deletion of the Smarcad1-interacting TE also led to a small but significant decrease in gene expression ( Figure 4H ) . It remains unclear whether failure to isolate homozygous clones was due to a loss of ESC self-renewal caused by Smarcad1 depletion ( Hong et al . , 2009 ) . Excision of the remaining two TEs in ESCs had no effect on the expression of target genes ( Figure 4I , J ) , including Akap12 , suggesting that the previously reported regulatory role of this TE is cell line-dependent ( Sundaram et al . , 2017 ) . In addition to genetic editing experiments , we also analysed data from an ESC line of a hybrid 129\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0Cast background , which displays substantial sequence variation between alleles . Using ATAC-seq data from this line ( Giorgetti et al . , 2016 ) , we first identified 98 TEs with biased chromatin accessibility signal across the two genetic backgrounds , suggestive of allele-specific enhancer activity . This included five elements that were polymorphic between 129 and Cast ( according to structural variation data from the Mouse Genomes Project ) , as well as elements present in both species but bearing sequence variation . We then analysed RNA-seq data from the same cell line ( Gendrel et al . , 2014 ) to test for effects on allelic gene expression . However , out of 52 genes within 100 kb of a TE-derived allele-specific enhancer , only four displayed a\u00a0>\u00a01 . 5 fold difference in expression between alleles ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3 ) . Through these genetic approaches we have identified a small set of TEs that play a functional role in the regulation of gene expression in ESCs or TSCs . Yet other TEs play only minor , redundant or no role in gene regulation , despite strong correlative evidence at the level of chromatin composition and conformation . To test in a single experiment the regulatory roles of multiple TE+\u00a0enhancers in ESCs we performed CRISPR interference ( CRISPRi ) targeted at RLTR13D6 elements . We designed two sets of 4 sgRNAs each , with distinct strategies in mind ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A ) : a ) set 1 maximised the number of RLTR13D6 elements predicted to be targeted by at least one sgRNA ( n\u00a0=\u00a0420 elements with no mismatches , out of 805 ) ; b ) set 2 maximised the number of sgRNAs targeted to each RLTR13D6 element , resulting in a smaller number of copies being targeted ( n\u00a0=\u00a0129 ) . The only substantial predicted off-target effects were with TEs of related RLTR13 subfamilies ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B ) , which we took into account for downstream analyses . We then established ESC lines stably expressing a dCas9-KRAB fusion protein , followed by lentiviral transduction of either sgRNA set or an empty vector control . After selection of cells expressing both dCas9-KRAB and sgRNAs , we performed H3K27ac ChIP-seq and RNA-seq analyses 5\u20138 days post-infection . Although we failed to get adequate signal from a Cas9 ChIP-seq , analysis of published data from a CRISPRi experiment on human LTR5Hs elements ( Fuentes et al . , 2018 ) showed that the number of sgRNAs predicted to bind each element strongly correlates with Cas9 ChIP-seq signal ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1C ) . As 97% of Cas9 binding events at LTR5Hs elements could be predicted in silico , we used sgRNA binding predictions as a surrogate measure for Cas9 binding . Analysis of the H3K27ac ChIP-seq data revealed a reduction in H3K27ac signal at RLTR13D6 elements that were predicted to be targeted by each of the sgRNA sets , whereas H3K27ac levels at RLTR9 elements were unaffected ( Figure 5A , B ) . Notably , elements targeted by multiple sgRNAs displayed a larger reduction in H3K27ac than those targeted by a single sgRNA ( Figure 5A , B ) , in line with recent findings ( Fuentes et al . , 2018 ) . For sgRNA set 1 , CRISPRi resulted in a\u00a0>\u00a02 fold loss of H3K27ac signal at 30 ( 56% ) RLTR13D6-targeted elements that overlapped a H3K27ac peak . A similar number was obtained for sgRNA set 2 ( n\u00a0=\u00a025 , 46% ) , with 34 elements being affected in total across the two sets ( out of 76 H3K27ac-marked elements ) . We then asked how these changes affected gene expression . Strikingly , only three genes were significantly differentially expressed upon CRISPRi across both sets of sgRNAs: Tdrd12 , Spp1 and Hook3 ( Figure 5C , D ) . All three cases were associated with a RLTR13D6 element targeted by one or both of the sgRNA sets ( Figure 5E\u2013G ) . Most likely these elements act as distal enhancers given that they lay\u00a0>6 kb away from the respective transcriptional start sites , whereas heterochromatin spreading as a result of CRISPRi tends to be limited to the open chromatin regions targeted by the sgRNAs ( Thakore et al . , 2015; Fuentes et al . , 2018 ) . Tdrd12 stood out as the most downregulated gene after CRISPRi with either sgRNA set , which together with results from genetic editing experiments above ( Figure 4G ) provide ample evidence that Tdrd12 expression in ESCs critically depends on an intronic RLTR13D6 element . Silencing of this element did not cause any structural alterations of the Tdrd12 transcript , supporting its role as an enhancer ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . The effect of CRISPRi on Hook3 expression was far more subtle , despite a pronounced loss of H3K27ac at the associated RLTR13D6 element ( Figure 5G ) . Notably , Spp1 downregulation occurred in a manner that seemed largely independent of changes in H3K27ac levels ( Figure 5F ) , suggesting that enhancer inactivation occurred through deposition of repressive marks and/or via impairment of TF binding by dCas9-KRAB . For the remainder of the targeted TEs , although as a group the associated genes displayed a significant downregulation upon CRISPRi , these changes were limited to at most 1 . 4-fold ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . This included genes interacting with TE+\u00a0enhancers displaying a similar or greater H3K27ac loss to that observed at Tdrd12- or Spp1-associated RLTR13D6 elements . To validate the relatively small effect of some TE+\u00a0enhancers on gene expression , we performed additional genetic editing experiments . We chose two RLTR13D6 elements that displayed\u00a0>2-fold change in H3K27ac levels upon CRISPRi ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3A , D ) , but with little or no effect on neighbouring gene expression ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3B , E ) . Upon CRISPR-mediated deletion of the respective TEs , gene expression levels largely agreed with CRISPRi results , with only the lowly expressed Tsacc gene being downregulated , although the effect was more pronounced in the genetic excision experiment ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3C , F ) . Therefore , whilst CRISPR of individual TEs constitutes a more sensitive approach , our CRISPRi data correlates with genetic excision data and is robust with respect to large effects on gene expression . These results suggest that only a small minority of RLTR13D6 elements play a major role in the regulation of gene expression in ESCs . This is in contrast with the broader correlations found by analysis of epigenomic and transcriptomic data in wildtype cells , highlighting the need to establish causal roles via direct molecular manipulation of TEs . \n TEs are increasingly being presented as major contributors to gene regulatory networks in a variety of contexts ( Chuong et al . , 2013; Chuong et al . , 2016; Kunarso et al . , 2010; Jacques et al . , 2013; Sundaram et al . , 2014; Lynch et al . , 2011; Fuentes et al . , 2018; Imbeault et al . , 2017 ) . Yet most of these studies have relied largely on the idea that biochemical activity at the chromatin level is indicative of function , a concept famously associated with the findings of the ENCODE project ( ENCODE Project Consortium , 2012 ) that triggered a still ongoing debate ( Graur et al . , 2013; Ponting , 2017; Doolittle and Brunet , 2017 ) . The use of genetic and epigenetic editing tools as presented here , and also used by other labs ( Chuong et al . , 2016; Jachowicz et al . , 2017; Fuentes et al . , 2018 ) , initiate a much needed move to evaluating causal roles for TEs in gene regulation . Our work has revealed that a set of TEs with regulatory potential in ESCs act mostly neutrally with respect to their effects on gene expression , which contrasts with earlier suggestions from analyses of chromatin profiling experiments ( Kunarso et al . , 2010 ) . In the absence of a substantial contribution of ESC TE+\u00a0enhancers to gene regulation , the striking correlations emerging from profiling efforts most likely reflect the fact that TE insertions are best tolerated in regions where their tissue-specific enhancer action matches the expression profiles of nearby genes . Whilst the enhancer activity of these TEs could be inconsequential for gene expression , this genomic \u2018safe niche\u2019 would be permissive for fixation by genetic drift . Additionally , we cannot exclude the possibility that some TE+\u00a0enhancers act redundantly with TE- enhancers , despite our attempt to isolate the effects of each of these enhancer groups . Such TEs could still be important to ensure regulatory robustness and , indeed , enhancer redundancy is a seemingly common feature of enhancer-gene networks ( Osterwalder et al . , 2018 ) . Extensive genetic work will be necessary to evaluate what proportion of TE+\u00a0enhancers act in a redundant fashion with other regulatory elements . In a contrasting example to our findings , epigenetic editing work by the Wysocka lab has revealed that a large proportion of LTR5Hs elements play significant roles in the regulation of nearly 300 genes in a human embryonal carcinoma cell line ( Fuentes et al . , 2018 ) . Notably , in the latter study virtually all H3K27ac-marked LTR5Hs elements were inactivated by CRISPRi ( 257 copies , according to our own analysis ) , probably due to the use of twelve sgRNAs simultaneously ( Fuentes et al . , 2018 ) . It is therefore possible that more efficient targeting of all H3K27ac-marked RLTR13D6 elements ( 76 copies ) in mouse ESCs would uncover additional regulatory elements . However , the effects seen here from silencing 34 ( 44% ) of these copies suggest that regulatory RLTR13D6 elements would likely remain a minority . Another explanation to the differences between LTR5Hs and RLTR13D6 action is that the regulatory effects of TEs are variable between families and cellular contexts . Indeed , other TEs considered here and whose effects we did not test by CRISPRi ( RLTR9 , RLTR13D5 , RLTR13B ) , may play important roles in ESC and TSC gene regulation . These considerations further emphasise the need to perform functional experiments on a case-by-case basis . Despite the neutral action of most TEs analysed here , we have uncovered a number of elements that act as key enhancers of gene expression in ESCs ( Tdrd12 , Smarcad1 , Spp1 and Hook3 ) and TSCs ( Map3k8 and Scarf2 ) . But do these TE insertions impact on cellular and organismal phenotypes , ultimately affecting host fitness ? TDRD12 is a protein essential for secondary piRNA production in mice and is essential for male fertility ( Pandey et al . , 2013; Pandey et al . , 2018 ) . It is therefore possible that the RLTR13D6 element we identified is also active during male germ line development , which would ironically implicate it in genome defence against the mobility of younger , piRNA-targeted TEs . Smarcad1 knockout mice are subviable , displaying growth defects and low fertility ( Schoor et al . , 1999 ) . It remains to be seen whether the activity of the RLTR9E element we identified plays any role in these phenotypes , possibly by affecting early embryonic differentiation ( Hong et al . , 2009 ) . Other genes that we found to be regulated by TEs are not essential for development: both Map3k8 ( Dumitru et al . , 2000 ) or Spp1 ( Rittling et al . , 1998 ) knockout mice are viable and appear to develop normally . In these cases it is likely that the action of the associated TEs is inconsequential to the organism , although there could be more subtle embryonic phenotypes or these TEs could play additional roles outside of the early developmental context . Notably , most exemplars of phenotypically relevant TE-derived regulatory elements have been uncovered by analysing naturally occurring phenotypes ( Lisch , 2013; Chuong et al . , 2017 ) . The reverse approach of searching for phenotypes linked with putative cis-acting TEs has the potential to reveal a wide array of adaptive TE insertions , although this is nonetheless challenging and examples to date are limited ( Chuong et al . , 2017 ) . At a time when epigenomic data are providing abundant indications that TEs play functional regulatory roles , our findings place these observations into perspective and provide a reminder that a large proportion of mammalian genomic sequences are neutrally evolving . Yet evolutionary tinkering ( Jacob , 1977 ) may still benefit from a large amount of \u2018junk DNA\u2019 that occasionally can be put to good use . As was fittingly put by Goodier and Kazazian , \u2018evolution has been adept of turning some \u2018junk\u2019 into treasure\u2019 ( Goodier and Kazazian , 2008 ) . \n E14 ESCs ( ATCC CRL-1821 ) were grown in feeder-free conditions in DMEM GlutaMAX medium ( Thermo Fisher ) supplemented with 15% FBS , non-essential amino acids , 50 \u03bcM 2-mercaproethanol and 1 , 000 U/ml ESGRO LIF ( Millipore ) . TS-Rs26 cells ( a kind gift from Dr . Myriam Hemberger ) were cultured under routine conditions ( Tanaka et al . , 1998 ) : 20% fetal bovine serum , 1 mM Na-pyruvate , Pen/Strep , 50 \u03bcM 2-mercaproethanol , 25 ng/ml bFGF and 1 \u03bcg/ml heparin in RPMI1640 , with 70% of the medium pre-conditioned on embryonic feeder cells . The identity of the cells was confirmed through RT-qPCR analyses of key ESC and TSC expression markers . Cells were negative for mycoplasma , as tested using the Sigma LookOut PCR kit . Two sgRNA sequences flanking each TE of interest were designed with the use of the Zhang lab online tool ( http://cripsr . mit . edu/ ) and cloned into pSpCas9 ( BB ) \u22122A-GFP ( Addgene #48138 ) ( Ran et al . , 2013 ) or a modified version of the eSpCas9 ( 1 . 1 ) plasmid system ( Addgene #71814 ) ( Slaymaker et al . , 2016 ) . The pSpCas9/eSpCas9 plasmid constructs were transfected into ESCs and TSCs using FuGENE 6 ( Promega ) with 4 \u03bcg equimolar mix of 5\u2019 sgRNA and 3\u2019 sgRNA in 6-well plates . Single GFP-positive cells were sorted into 96-well plates 48 hr post-transfection . After 7\u201310 days , growing colonies were genotyped using DNA isolated using QuickExtract ( Lucigen ) and the primers listed on Supplementary file 2 . Selected clones were grown further into 6-well plates before collecting RNA using QIAGEN\u2019s DNA/RNA mini kit or QIAzol reagent . For some clones , multiple RNA collections were performed at different passages ( see legend to Figure 4 ) . RNA was DNAse treated with the TURBO DNA-free Kit ( Ambion ) and reverse transcribed with the RevertAid First Strand cDNA Synthesis kit ( Thermo Fisher ) using supplier protocol with 100 ng - 2 \u03bcg input RNA . The MESA BLUE SYBR Green mastermix ( Eurogentec ) was used for qPCR analysis ( primers listed on Supplementary file 2 ) . To generate stable ESC line expressing dCas9-KRAB , cells were infected with a lentiviral vector ( a kind gift from Mark Dawson , Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre , Melbourne , Australia ) and mCherry-positive cells were sorted 48\u201396 hr post-infection . Guide RNA sequences targeting retroelement classes were designed with an R script which downloads all relevant retroelement sequences , identifies potential guide sequences within each sequence and returns guide candidates which match the highest number of targets . Potential off-target effects were verified using the Cas-OFFinder tool ( Bae et al . , 2014 ) and sgRNAs with minimal off-targets were selected . Designed sgRNA sequences were cloned into a lentiviral sgRNA vector ( a kind gift from Mark Dawson ) and packaged into viral particles . The dCas9-KRAB-expressing ESCs were infected and cells sorted at 48 hr to collect dual positive mCherry/BFP positive cells . Cells infected with the empty sgRNA vector were used as a control . RNA was collected by QIAzol extraction at 5 days or 8 days post-infection of the sgRNA lentivirus . Chromatin was collected at 8 days post-infection . Ribosomal RNA-depleted RNA-seq libraries were prepared with the NEBNext rRNA Depletion Kit ( New England BioLabs ) from 400 to 600 ng of QIAzol extracted total RNA . Libraries were sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 500 with single-ended 75 bp reads at the Barts London Genome Centre . Cells were fixed with 1% formaldehyde in PBS for 12 min , which was then quenched with glycine ( final concentration 0 . 125 M ) . Fixed cells were washed and lysed as previously described ( Latos et al . , 2015 ) . Chromatin was sonicated to an average size of 200\u2013700 bp using a Bioruptor Pico ( Diagenode ) . Immunoprecipitation was performed using 15 \u03bcg of chromatin and 2 . 5 \u03bcg of anti-H3K27ac antibody ( Active Motif #39133 ) . DNA purification was performed using the GeneJET PCR Purification Kit ( Thermo Fisher ) with DNA eluted in 80 \u03bcL of elution buffer . ChIP-seq libraries were prepared from 1 to 5 ng eluted DNA using NEBNext Ultra II DNA library Prep Kit ( New England BioLabs ) . Libraries were sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 500 with single-ended 75 bp reads at the Barts London Genome Centre . ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq data generated here or from external datasets ( Supplementary file 1 ) were mapped by trimming reads using Trim_galore ! and aligning to the mm10 genome assembly using Bowtie2 v2 . 1 . 0 ( Langmead and Salzberg , 2012 ) , followed by filtering of uniquely mapped reads . Data were normalised to total read count . ChIP-seq peak detection was performed using MACS2 v2 . 1 . 1 ( Zhang et al . , 2008 ) with -q 0 . 05; for histone marks the option --broad was used . ATAC-seq peak detection was performed using F-seq v1 . 84 ( Boyle et al . , 2008 ) with options -f 0 t 6 . For multi-tissue DNAse-seq data , peak annotation files generated by ENCODE were used . RNA-seq data generated here or from external datasets ( Supplementary file 1 ) were mapped by trimming reads using Trim_galore ! and aligning to the mm10 genome assembly with Tophat v2 . 0 . 9 ( Trapnell et al . , 2009 ) using a transcriptome index from Illumina\u2019s iGenomes . For ENCODE multi-tissue RNA-seq data , FPKM expression values were downloaded directly from ENCODE and the data were normalised by histogram matching . Processed CpG calls from publicly available BS-seq and TAB-seq data were downloaded from the respective GEO submissions ( Supplementary file 1 ) . To identify TE+\u00a0enhancers , coordinates for RLTR9 , RLTR13D6 , RLTR13D5 and RLTR13B elements were taken from the mm10 RepeatMasker annotation and filtered to remove elements either intersecting H3K4me3 ChIP-seq peaks or lying within 500 bp of a TSS from the NCBI RefSeq annotation . Enhancer-like elements were then selected if they intersected with all three of the following: H3K27ac ChIP-seq peaks , ATAC-seq peaks and binding sites for any of three key TFs ( OCT4 , NANOG or SOX2 for ESC TE+\u00a0enhancers; CDX2 , ELF5 or EOMES for TSC TE+\u00a0enhancers ) . To define TE- enhancers , ATAC-seq peaks that did not overlap any TEs annotated by RepeatMasker were used as a basis for potential enhancer regions . These regions were then filtered in the same manner as described for TE+\u00a0enhancers . Non-enhancer TEs were defined as mappable elements displaying low ATAC-seq signal . Mappability scores were obtained by mapping in silico generated reads and measuring the proportion of the element\u2019s length covered by uniquely mapped reads . Elements with a score higher than 0 . 5 were kept and from those with the lowest ATAC-seq signal selected as non-enhancer TEs . The number of elements selected for each class equated to twice the number of TE+\u00a0enhancers identified for the same class . To estimate how many ChIP-seq peaks could be missed due to low read mappability to TEs we used ChIPulate ( Datta et al . , 2019 ) to simulate ChIP-seq data . We generated reads for simulated peaks centred on each TE of interest , as well as control reads spanning 10 kb around each peak , with the following parameters: --read-length 40 --fragment-length 150 --fragment-jitter 40 . These reads were mapped back to the mouse genome followed by peak detection using MACS2 as described above . As a control , peak detection was also performed on the simulated ( pre-mapping ) data , which successfully detected all TE copies . Processed promoter-genome spatial interactions were downloaded from the respective ArrayExpress submission ( Supplementary file 1 ) . Each element of interest ( TE+\u00a0enhancers , TE- enhancers , non-enhancer TEs ) was intersected with the list of non-promoter restriction fragments in the PCHi-C data and coupled to the gene promoter ( s ) it interacted with . Expression values from RNA-seq data were assigned to each element based on these relationships . To distinguish the putative effects of TE+\u00a0and TE- enhancers , only genes interacting exclusively with one type of enhancer were considered . Motif analysis of TE copies was performed using the FIMO tool of the MEME SUITE v5 . 0 . 1 ( Bailey et al . , 2015 ) using the HOCOMOCO v11 TF motif database . Data from the FIREWACh enhancer reporter assay were obtained from the respective publication ( Murtha et al . , 2014 ) . Briefly , FIREWACh uses a library of restriction-digested DNA fragments from accessible regions of the genome , which are cloned into a lentiviral plasmid containing a GFP reporter . The lentiviral library was transduced into ESCs , followed by sorting of GFP+\u00a0cells and sequencing of the cloned fragments . For our analysis , we used the coordinates of both the identified regulatory elements and the input library fragments . Processed allele-specific data from ATAC-seq experiments on 129\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0Cast hybrid ESCs were downloaded from the respective GEO submission ( Supplementary file 1 ) . Peaks containing at least five reads in one of the alleles and an allelic ratio ( 129 reads/total reads ) larger than 0 . 8 or lower than 0 . 2 were selected as allele-specific regulatory elements . These were intersected with TE annotations to identify putative allele-specific TE-derived regulatory elements . RNA-seq data from the same cell line ( Supplementary file 1 ) were used to extract expression values for genes within 100 kb of allele-specific TE regulatory elements .", "headings": ["Abstract", "Introduction", "Results", "Discussion", "Materials and methods"], "keywords": ["chromosomes and gene expression", "genetics and genomics"], "id": "elife-44344-v3"}
{"lay_summary": "Plants rely on carbon for their growth and survival: in a process called photosynthesis , they use energy from sunlight to convert carbon dioxide and water into carbohydrates and oxygen gas . The chemical reactions that make up photosynthesis are powered by a chain of enzymes , and plants must ensure that these enzymes\u2014which are in the leaves of the plant\u2014are supplied with enough carbon dioxide and water . Carbon dioxide from the atmosphere enters plants through pores in their leaves , but water must be carried up the plant from the roots . The type of photosynthesis used by about 90% of flowering plant species\u2014including tomatoes and rice\u2014is called C3 photosynthesis . The first step in this process begins with an enzyme called RuBisCO , which reacts with carbon dioxide and a substance called RuBP to form molecules that contain three carbon atoms ( hence the name C3 photosynthesis ) . In a hot climate , however , a plant can lose a lot of water through the pores in its leaves: closing these pores allows the plant to retain water , but this also reduces the supply of carbon dioxide . Under these circumstances this causes problems because RuBisCO uses oxygen to break down RuBP , instead of creating sugars , when carbon dioxide is not readily available . To prevent this process , which wastes a lot of energy and resources , some plants\u2014including maize , sugar cane and many other agricultural staples\u2014have evolved an alternative process called C4 photosynthesis . Although it is more complex than C3 photosynthesis , and required many changes to be made to the structure of leaves , C4 photosynthesis has evolved on more than 60 different occasions . In C4 plants , the mesophyll\u2014the region that is associated with the capture of carbon dioxide by RuBisCO in C3 plants\u2014contains high levels of an alternative enzyme called PEPC that converts carbon dioxide molecules into an acid that contains four carbon atoms . To avoid carbon dioxide being captured by both enzymes , C4 plants evolved to relocate RuBisCO from the mesophyll to a second set of cells in an airtight structure known as the bundle sheath . The four-carbon acids produced by PEPC diffuse to the cells in the bundle sheath , where they are broken down into carbon dioxide molecules , and photosynthesis then proceeds as normal . This process allows photosynthesis to continue when the level of carbon dioxide in the leave is low because the plant has closed its pores to retain water . Since C4 plants grow faster than C3 plants , and also require less water , plant biologists would like to introduce certain C4 traits into C3 crop plants . To help with this process , Williams , Johnston et al . have used computational methods to explore how C4 photosynthesis evolved from ancestral C3 plants . This involved investigating the prevalence of 16 traits that are common to C4 plants in a total of 73 species that undergo C3 or C4 photosynthesis ( including 37 species that possess characteristics of both C3 and C4 ) . Williams , Johnston et al . then went on to produce a new mathematical model that represents evolutionary processes as pathways across a multi-dimensional \u201clandscape\u201d . The model shows that traits can be acquired in various orders , and that C4 photosynthesis evolved through a number of independent pathways . Some traits that evolved early in the transitions to C4 photosynthesis influenced how evolution proceeded , providing \u201cfoundations\u201d upon which further changes evolved . Interestingly , the structure of the leaf itself appeared to change before any of the photosynthetic enzymes changed . This led Williams , Johnston et al . to conclude that climate change\u2014in particular , the declines in carbon dioxide levels that occurred in prehistoric times\u2014was probably not responsible for the original evolution of C4 photosynthesis . Nevertheless , these results could help with efforts to adapt important C3 crop plants to on-going changes in our climate .", "article": "C4 photosynthesis has independently evolved from the ancestral C3 pathway in at least 60 plant lineages , but , as with other complex traits , how it evolved is unclear . Here we show that the polyphyletic appearance of C4 photosynthesis is associated with diverse and flexible evolutionary paths that group into four major trajectories . We conducted a meta-analysis of 18 lineages containing species that use C3 , C4 , or intermediate C3\u2013C4 forms of photosynthesis to parameterise a 16-dimensional phenotypic landscape . We then developed and experimentally verified a novel Bayesian approach based on a hidden Markov model that predicts how the C4 phenotype evolved . The alternative evolutionary histories underlying the appearance of C4 photosynthesis were determined by ancestral lineage and initial phenotypic alterations unrelated to photosynthesis . We conclude that the order of C4 trait acquisition is flexible and driven by non-photosynthetic drivers . This flexibility will have facilitated the convergent evolution of this complex trait . \n The convergent evolution of complex traits is surprisingly common , with examples including camera-like eyes of cephalopods , vertebrates , and cnidaria ( Kozmik et al . , 2008 ) , mimicry in invertebrates and vertebrates ( Santos et al . , 2003; Wilson et al . , 2012 ) and the different photosynthetic machineries of plants ( Sage et al . , 2011a ) . While the polyphyletic origin of simple traits ( Hill et al . , 2006; Steiner et al . , 2009 ) is underpinned by flexibility in the underlying molecular mechanisms , the extent to which this applies to complex traits is less clear . C4 photosynthesis is both highly complex , involving alterations to leaf anatomy , cellular ultrastructure , and photosynthetic metabolism , and also convergent , being found in at least 60 independent lineages of angiosperms ( Sage et al . , 2011a ) . As the emergence of the entire C4 phenotype cannot be comprehensively explored experimentally , C4 photosynthesis is an ideal system for the mathematical modelling of complex trait evolution as transitions on an underlying phenotype landscape . Furthermore , understanding the evolutionary events that have generated C4 photosynthesis on many independent occasions has the potential to inform approaches being undertaken to engineer C4 photosynthesis into C3 crop species ( Hibberd et al . , 2008 ) . The C4 pathway is estimated to have first evolved between 32 and 25 million years ago ( Christin et al . , 2011b ) in response to multiple ecological drivers , including decreasing atmospheric CO2 concentration ( Vicentini et al . , 2008 ) . C4 species have since radiated to represent the most productive crops and native vegetation on the planet because modifications to their leaves increase the efficiency of photosynthesis in the sub-tropics and tropics ( Edwards et al . , 2010 ) . In C4 plants , photosynthetic efficiency is improved compared with C3 species because significant alterations to leaf anatomy , cell biology and biochemistry lead to higher concentrations of CO2 around the primary carboxylase RuBisCO Slack and Hatch , 1967; Langdale , 2011 ) . The morphology of C4 leaves is typically modified into so-called Kranz anatomy that consists of repeating units of vein , bundle sheath ( BS ) and mesophyll ( M ) cells ( Hattersley , 1984; Langdale , 2011 ) ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . Photosynthetic metabolism becomes modified and compartmentalised between the M and BS , with M cells lacking RuBisCO but instead containing high activities of the alternate carboxylase PEPC to generate C4 acids . The diffusion of these acids followed by their decarboxylation in BS cells around RuBisCO increases CO2 supply and therefore photosynthetic efficiency ( Zhu et al . , 2008 ) . C4 acids are decarboxylated by at least one of three enzymes within BS cells: NADP- or NAD-dependent malic enzymes ( NADP-ME or NAD-ME respectively ) , or phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase ( PCK ) ( Hatch et al . , 1975 ) . Specific lineages of C4 species have typically been classified into one of three sub-types , based on the activity of these decarboxylases , as well as anatomical and cellular traits that consistently correlate with each other ( Furbank , 2011 ) . The genetic mechanisms underlying the evolution of cell-specific gene expression associated with the separation of photosynthetic metabolism between M and BS cells involve both alterations to cis-elements and trans-acting factors ( Akyildiz et al . , 2007; Brown et al . , 2011; Kajala et al . , 2012; Williams et al . , 2012 ) . Phylogenetically independent lineages of C4 plants have co-opted homologous mechanisms to generate cell specificity ( Brown et al . , 2011 ) as well as the altered allosteric regulation of C4 enzymes ( Christin et al . , 2007 ) indicating that parallel evolution underpins at least part of the convergent C4 syndrome . However , while a substantial amount of work has addressed the molecular alterations that generate the biochemical differences between C3 and C4 plants ( Williams et al . , 2012 ) much less is known about the order and flexibility with which phenotypic traits important for C4 photosynthesis are acquired ( Sage et al . , 2012 ) . Clues to this question exist in the form of C3\u2013C4 intermediates , species exhibiting characteristics of both C3 or C4 photosynthesis , such as the activity or localisation of C4 cycle enzymes ( Hattersley and Stone , 1986 ) , the possession of one or more anatomical or cellular adaptations associated with C4 photosynthesis ( Moore et al . , 1987 ) , or combinations of both ( e . g . , Kennedy et al . , 1980; Kotayeva et al . , 2010 ) . To address these unknown aspects of C4 evolutionary history , we combined the concept of considering evolutionary paths as stochastic processes on complex adaptive landscapes ( Wright , 1932; Gavrilets , 1997 ) with the analysis of extant C3\u2013C4 intermediate species to develop a predictive model of how the full C4 phenotype evolved . \n To parameterise the phenotypic landscape underlying photosynthetic phenotypes , data was consolidated from 43 studies encompassing 18 C3 , 18 C4 , and 37 C3\u2013C4 intermediate species from 22 genera ( Table 1 ) . These C3\u2013C4 species are from 18 independent lineages likely representing 18 distinct evolutionary origins of C3\u2013C4 intermediacy ( Sage et al . , 2011a ) ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . These studies were used to quantify 16 biochemical , anatomical , and cellular characteristics associated with C4 photosynthesis ( Figure 1\u2014source data 1 ) . Principal components analysis ( PCA ) was performed to confirm the phenotypic intermediacy of the C3\u2013C4 species ( Figure 1A ) . This result , the sister-group relationships of C3\u2013C4 species with congeneric C4 clades ( McKown et al . , 2005; Vogan et al . , 2007; Christin et al . , 2011a; Sage et al . , 2011a; Khoshravesh et al . , 2012 ) and the prevalence of extant C3\u2013C4 species in genera with the most recent origins of C4 photosynthesis ( Christin et al . , 2011b ) all support the notion that C3\u2013C4 species represent phenotypic states through which transitions to C4 photosynthesis could occur . The combined traits of C3\u2013C4 intermediate species therefore represent samples from across the space of phenotypes connecting C3 to C4 photosynthesis ( Figure 1B ) . Within our meta-analysis data , C3\u2013C4 phenotypes were available for 33 eudicot and 4 monocot species . 16 and 17 of these species have extant congeneric relatives performing NADP-ME or NAD-ME sub-type C4 photosynthesis respectively . No C3\u2013C4 relatives of PCK sub-type C4 species are known ( Sage et al . , 2011a ) . Our meta-analysis therefore encompassed a variety of taxonomic lineages , as well as representing close relatives of known phenotypic variants performing C4 photosynthesis . 10 . 7554/eLife . 00961 . 003Table 1 .

A graphical representation of key phenotypic changes distinguishing C3 and C4 leaves . Plants using C4 photosynthesis possess a number of anatomical , cellular , and biochemical adaptations that distinguish them from C3 ancestors . These include decreased vein spacing ( A ) and enlarged bundle sheath ( BS ) cells , which lie adjacent to veins ( B ) . Together , these adaptations decrease the ratio of mesophyll ( M ) to BS cell volume . C4 metabolism is generated by the increased abundance and M or BS-specific expression of multiple enzymes ( shown in purple ) , which are expressed in both M and BS cells of C3 leaves .

Illustration of the principle by which evolutionary pathways emit intermediate signals . In this illustration , the phenotype consists of three traits , yielding a simple ( hyper ) cubic transition network . Simulated trajectories on this network evolve according to the weights of network edges ( A ) . Probabilities were calculated from the signals emitted by simulated trajectories at intermediate nodes ( B ) . Ensembles of trajectories were simulated to obtain probabilities from these signals for every possible evolutionary transition ( C ) . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 00961 . 009 We defined each C4 trait as either being absent ( 0 ) or present ( 1 ) . For quantitative traits the expectation-maximization ( EM ) algorithm and hierarchical clustering were used to impartially assign binary scores ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3 ) . This generated a 16-bit string for each of the species ( Figure 1\u2014source data 1 ) , with a presence or absence score for each of the traits included in our meta-analysis . This defined a 16-dimensional phenotype space with 216 ( 65 , 536 ) nodes corresponding to all possible combinations of presence ( 1 ) and absence ( 0 ) scores for each characteristic . Many existing methods of inference for evolutionary trajectories rely on phylogenetic information or assumptions about the fitness landscape underlying evolutionary dynamics ( Weinreich et al . , 2005; Lobkovsky et al . , 2011; Mooers and Heard , 2013 ) . In convergent evolution , these properties are not always known , as convergent lineages may be genetically distant and associated with poor phylogenetic reconstructions . In addition , the selective pressures experienced by each may be different and dynamic . We therefore consider the convergent evolution of C4 fundamentally as the acquisition of the key phenotypic traits identified through our meta-analysis ( Figure 1B ) . The process of acquisition of these traits can be pictured as a path on the 16-dimensional hypercube ( Figure 1C ) , from the node labelled with all 0\u2019s ( the C3 phenotype , with no C4 characteristics ) to the node labelled with all 1\u2019s ( the C4 phenotype , with all C4 characteristics ) . The phenotypic landscape underlying the evolution of C4 photosynthesis was then modelled as a transition network , with weighted edges describing the probability of transitions occurring between two phenotypic states ( two nodes on the hypercube , Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4 ) . Observed intermediate points were then used to constrain the structure of these phenotypic landscapes . To do this , we developed inferential machinery based on the framework of Hidden Markov Models ( HMMs ) ( Rabiner , 1989 ) ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4 ) and simulated an ensemble of Markov chains on trial transition networks . Each of these chains represents a possible evolutionary pathway from C3 to C4 , and passes through several intermediate phenotypic states . The likelihood of observing intermediate states with characteristics compatible with the biologically observed data on C3\u2013C4 intermediates was recorded for the set of paths supported on each trial network . A Bayesian MCMC procedure was used to sample from the set of networks most compatible with the meta-analysis dataset , and thus most likely to represent the underlying dynamics of C4 evolution . The order in which phenotypic characteristics were acquired was recorded for paths on each network compatible with the C3\u2013C4 species data , and posterior probability distributions ( given uninformative priors ) for the time-ordered acquisition of each C4 trait were generated . For further information and mathematical details , see \u2018Methods\u2019 . To model the evolutionary paths generating C4 without requiring additional dimensionality , we imposed that only one C4 trait may be acquired at a time , and loss of acquired C4 traits was forbidden . To test if we were nevertheless able to detect traits acquired simultaneously in evolution , we tested our approach on artificial positive control datasets containing intermediate nodes representing a stepwise evolutionary sequence of events ( Figure 2A ) and an evolutionary pathway in which four traits are acquired simultaneously at a time ( Figure 2B ) . Our approach clearly assigned equal acquisition probabilities to traits whose timing was linked in the underlying dataset , even when 50% of the data was occluded ( Figure 2B ) . These data are consistent with this approach detecting the simultaneous acquisition of traits in evolution , even though single-trait acquisitions are simulated . 10 . 7554/eLife . 00961 . 010Figure 2 . Verifying a novel Bayesian approach for predicting evolutionary trajectories . ( A and B ) Datasets were obtained from an artificially constructed diagonal dynamic matrix ( A ) , and a diagonal matrix with linked timing of locus acquisitions ( B ) . The single , diagonal evolutionary trajectory was clearly replicated in both examples , over a time-scale of 16 individual steps , or four coarse-grained quartiles . We subjected these artificial datasets to our inferential machinery with fully characterised artificial species , and with 50% of data occluded in order to replicate the proportion of missing data from our C3\u2013C4 dataset . ( C ) When applied to our meta-analysis of C3\u2013C4 data , predictions were generated for every trait missing from the biological dataset . We tested this predictive machinery by generating 29 artificial datasets , each missing one data point , and comparing the presence/absence of the trait as predicted by our approach with the experimental data from the original study . ( D and E ) Quantitative real-time PCR ( qPCR ) was used to verify the predicted phenotypes of four C3\u2013C4 species . The abundance RbcS ( D ) and MDH ( E ) transcripts were determined from six Flaveria species . White bars represent phenotypes already determined by other studies , grey bars those that were predicted by the model and asterisks denote intermediate species phenotypes correctly predicted by our approach ( Error bars indicate SEM , N = 3 ) .

A probability for the presence of unobserved phenotypic characters was generated for every characteristic not yet studied in each of the C3\u2013C4 species included in this study . Red ( upward triangles ) predict a posterior mean probability of >0 . 75 for the presence of a C4 trait; blue ( downward triangles ) predict a posterior mean probability of <0 . 25 . Darker triangles represent probabilities whose standard deviations ( SD ) are lower than 0 . 25 . Yellow blocks correspond to known data: no symbol is present for traits for which presence and absence have an equal probability ( 0 . 25\u20130 . 75 ) . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 00961 . 011 The presence and absence of unknown phenotypes were predicted by recording all phenotypes encountered along a set of simulated evolutionary trajectories that were compatible with the data from a given species ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4 ) , and calculating the posterior distribution of the proportion of these phenotypes with the value 1 for the unknown trait . If the mean of this distribution was <25% or >75% , and that value fell outside one standard deviation of the mean , the missing trait was assigned a strong prediction of absence or presence . To comprehensively test the accuracy of our predictive machinery , we generated 29 occluded datasets , consisting of the original full dataset with one randomly chosen data point removed . The predicted phenotype of each missing trait was then compared with the known phenotype published in the original study . For 29 occluded traits 18 were strongly predicted to be present or absent , and the remaining 11 predictions were neutral . Of the 18 strongly predicted traits ( i . e . , <25% or >75% probability ) , 15 were correct , with only one false positive and two false negative predictions ( Figure 2C ) . The approach therefore assigns neutral predictions much more frequently than false positive or false negative predictions , suggesting that its outputs are highly conservative , and thus unlikely to produce artefacts . Predictions were generated for phenotypes that have not yet been described in C3\u2013C4 species ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . Quantitative real-time PCR experimentally verified a subset of these , relating to abundance of C4 enzymes not previously measured ( Figure 2D\u2013E ) . We also found that the model was able to successfully infer evolutionary dynamics in artificially constructed datasets ( Figure 2A\u2013B ) . Taken together , these prediction and verification studies illustrate that our approach robustly identifies key features of C4 evolution . The posterior probability distributions for the acquisition time of each phenotypic trait were combined to produce an objective , computationally generated blueprint for the order of evolutionary events generating C4 photosynthesis ( Figure 3 ) . These results were consistent with previous work on subsets of C4 lineages that proposed the BS-specificity of GDC occurs prior to the evolution of C4 metabolism ( Hylton et al . , 1988; Rawsthorne et al . , 1988; Devi et al . , 1995; Sage et al . , 2012 ) , and loss of RuBisCO from M cells occurs late ( Cheng et al . , 1988; Khoshravesh et al . , 2012 ) , but also provided higher resolution insight into the order of events generating C4 metabolism . Alterations to leaf anatomy as well as cell-specificity and increased abundance of multiple C4 cycle enzymes were predicted to evolve prior to any alteration to the primary C3 and C4 photosynthetic enzymes RuBisCO and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase ( PEPC ) ( Figure 3 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 00961 . 012Figure 3 .

Traits were also assigned presence/absence scores by hierarchical clustering . Analysis of data partitioned by hierarchical clustering predicted a similar sequence of evolutionary events to that shown in Figure 3 ( A ) . Direct comparison of posterior probabilities reveals a high degree of similarity between results from the data clustered by hierarchical clustering versus the EM algorithm ( B ) . These results suggest our conclusions are not affected by the different methods of assigning binary scores to traits .

Adding or removing traits does not affect the predicted order of evolutionary events . Two independent pairs of traits were randomly selected and deleted from the analysis . In both cases , removing two traits did not affect the predicted timing of the remaining 14 traits in the analysis ( A and B ) . Furthermore , including two additional traits associated with C4 photosynthesis also did not alter the predicted timing of other traits ( C ) . Together , these data suggest our results are robust to both the removal and addition of traits from the phenotype space .

The extent to which C4 traits are linked in evolution was assessed by modelling C4 evolution from a start phenotype with one trait already acquired . Linked traits would have a high probability of being acquired in the next event . Artificially acquired traits are listed on the x-axis and the probability of each additional C4 trait being subsequently acquired ( y-axis ) is denoted in each pixel of the heat map . There is overall very low probability for multiple traits being linked in their acquisition in the evolution of C4 . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 00961 . 015 There was also strong evidence for enlargement of BS cells as an early innovation in most C4 lineages ( Figure 3 ) , consistent with the suggestion that this was an ancestral state within C3 ancestors of C4 grass lineages and that this contributed to the high number of C4 origins within this family ( Christin et al . , 2013; Griffiths et al . , 2013 ) . The compartmentation of PEPC into M cells and its increased abundance compared with C3 leaves was predicted to occur at similar times , but for all other C4 enzymes the evolution of increased abundance and cellular compartmentation were clearly separated by the acquisition of other traits ( Figure 3 ) . This result is consistent with molecular analysis of genes encoding C4 enzymes that indicates cell-specificity and increased expression are mediated by different cis-elements ( Akyildiz et al . , 2007; Kajala et al . , 2012; Wiludda et al . , 2012 ) . Two approaches were taken to verify that these conclusions are robust and accurately reflect biological data . First , the analysis was repeated using scores for presence or absence of traits that were assigned by hierarchical clustering , as opposed to using the EM algorithm ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A ) . Although hierarchical clustering generated differences in the scoring of a small number of traits , the predicted evolutionary trajectories were not affected , producing highly similar results ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B ) . Second , we introduced structural changes to the phenotype space , by both adding and subtracting traits from the analysis ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . Removing two independent pairs of traits from the analysis did not affect the predicted timing of the remaining 14 traits ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2A\u2013B ) . However , increased standard deviations were observed in some cases ( e . g . , for the probabilities of acquiring enlarged BS cells , or decreased vein spacing ) likely a consequence of using fewer data . To test if the addition of data might also affect the results , we performed an analysis with two additional traits included ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2C ) . We selected two traits that have been widely observed in C3\u2013C4 species , the centripetal positioning of mitochondria and the centrifugal or centripetal position of chloroplasts within BS cells ( Sage et al . , 2012 ) . Despite the widespread occurrence of these traits , their functional importance remains unclear ( Sage et al . , 2012 ) . Consistent with observations made from several genera , we predict that these cellular alterations are acquired early in the evolution of C4 photosynthesis ( Hylton et al . , 1988; McKown and Dengler , 2007; Muhaidat et al . , 2011; Sage et al . , 2011b ) . Importantly , including these additional early traits in the analysis did not alter the predicted order of the original 16 traits . Together , these analyses did not alter our main conclusions , suggesting that they are robust . In addition to the likely order of evolutionary events generating C4 photosynthesis , the number of molecular alterations required is also unknown . We therefore aimed to test if multiple traits were predicted to evolve with linked timing , and therefore likely mediated by a single underlying mechanism . To achieve this , we performed a contingency analysis by considering trajectories across phenotype space beginning with a given initial acquisition step . In this analysis , the starting genome had one of the 16 traits acquired and the rest absent , and the contingency of the subsequent trajectory upon the initial step was recorded . This approach was designed to test if acquiring one C4 trait increased the probability of subsequently acquiring other traits , thus detecting if the evolution of multiple traits is linked by underlying mechanisms . Inflexible linkage between multiple traits was detected in artificial positive control datasets ( Figure 2B ) but not in the C3\u2013C4 dataset ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3 ) . This result suggests that the order of C4 trait acquisition is flexible . Multiple origins of C4 may therefore have been facilitated by this flexibility in the evolutionary pathways connecting C3 and C4 phenotypes . Our Bayesian analysis strongly indicates that there are multiple evolutionary pathways by which C4 traits are acquired by all lineages of C4 plants . First , no single sequence of acquisitions was capable of producing intermediate phenotypes compatible with all observations ( \u2018Methods\u2019 ) . Second , several traits such as compartmentation of GDC into BS and the increased number of chloroplasts in the BS clearly displayed bimodal probability distributions for their acquisition ( Figure 3 ) . This bimodality is indicative of multiple distinct pathways to C4 photosynthesis that acquire traits at earlier or later times . To investigate factors underlying this bimodality , we inferred evolutionary pathways generating the C4 leaf using data from monocot and eudicot lineages , or from lineages using NAD malic enzyme ( NAD\u2013ME ) or NADP malic enzyme ( NADP-ME ) as their primary C4 acid decarboxylase . PCA on the entire set of inferred transition networks for monocot and dicot subsets revealed distinct separation ( Figure 4A ) , suggesting that the topology of the evolutionary landscape surrounding C4 is largely different for these two anciently diverged taxa . Performing this PCA including networks that were inferred from the full data set ( with both lineages ) confirmed that this separation is a robust result and involves posterior variation on a comparable scale to that of the full set of possible networks ( Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . Analysis of the posterior probabilities of the mean pathways representing either monocots or dicots revealed that this separation is the result of differences in the timing of events generating both anatomical and biochemical traits ( Figure 4C ) . We propose that the ancient divergence of the monocot and eudicot clades constrained the evolution of C4 photosynthesis to broadly different evolutionary pathways in each . 10 . 7554/eLife . 00961 . 016Figure 4 . Differences in the evolutionary events generating different C4 sub-types and distantly related taxa . Principal component analysis ( PCA ) on the entire landscape of transition probabilities using only monocot and eudicot data ( A ) and data from NADP-ME and NAD-ME sub-type lineages ( B ) shows broad differences between the evolutionary pathways generating C4 in each taxon . Monocots and eudicots differ in the predicted timing of events generating C4 anatomy and biochemistry ( C ) , whereas NADP-ME and NAD-ME lineages differ primarily in the evolution of decreased vein spacing and greater numbers of chloroplasts in BS cells ( D ) .

PCA was performed on sampled transition networks from the sets compatible with the overall dataset and each of the two subsets corresponding to different lineages: overall/monocot/eudicot ( A ) overall/NAD-ME/NADP-ME ( B ) . In ( A ) the variation between monocot and eudicot lineages is observed to be preserved when the overall transition networks are included , and on a similar quantitative scale to the variation in the overall set , embedded mainly on the first principal axis . In ( B ) the variation is of a similar scale but less distinct , correlating more with the second principal axis . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 00961 . 017 There was more overlap between the landscapes generating NAD\u2013ME and NADP-ME species ( Figure 4B ) , likely reflecting the convergent origins of NAD\u2013ME and NADP-ME sub-types ( Furbank , 2011; Sage et al . , 2011a ) . Despite the traditional definition of these lineages on the basis of biochemical differences , we detected differences in the timing of their anatomical evolution ( Figure 4D ) . For example , in NAD\u2013ME lineages , increased vein density was predicted to be acquired early in C4 evolution , while in NADP-ME species this trait showed a broadly different trajectory ( Figure 4D ) . The proliferation of chloroplasts in the BS was also acquired with different timings between the two sub-types . The alternative evolutionary pathways generating the NADP-ME and NAD\u2013ME subtypes were therefore defined by differences in the timing of anatomical and cellular traits that are predicted to precede the majority of biochemical alterations ( Figure 3 , Figure 4D ) . We therefore conclude that these distinct sub-types evolved as a consequence of alternative evolutionary histories in response to non-photosynthetic pressures . Furthermore , we propose that early evolutionary events determined the downstream phenotypes of C4 sub-types by restricting lineages to independent pathways across phenotype space . \n The adaptive landscape metaphor has provided a powerful conceptual framework within which evolutionary transitions can be modelled ( Gavrilets , 1997; Whibley et al . , 2006; Lobkovsky et al . , 2011 ) . However , the majority of complex biological traits provide numerous challenges in utilising such an approach , including missing phenotypic data , incomplete phylogenetic information and in the case of convergent evolution , variable ancestral states . Here we report the development of a novel , predictive Bayesian approach that is able to infer likely evolutionary trajectories connecting phenotypes from sparsely sampled , highly stochastic data . With this model , we provided insights into the evolution of one of the most complex traits to have arisen in multiple lineages: C4 photosynthesis . However , as our approach is not dependent on detailed phylogenetic inference , we propose that it could be used to model the evolution of other complex traits , such as those in the fossil record , which are also currently limited by the fragmented nature of data available ( Kidwell and Holland , 2002 ) . Our approach is also not limited by the time-scale over which predicted trajectories occur . As a result , it may be useful in inferring pathways underlying stochastic processes occurring over much shorter timescales , such as disease or tumour progression , or the differentiation of cell types . A central hypothesis for the ecological drivers of C4 evolution is that declining CO2 concentration in the Oligocene decreased the rate of carboxylation by RuBisCO , creating a strong pressure to evolve alternative photosynthetic strategies ( Christin et al . , 2008; Vicentini et al . , 2008 ) . According to this hypothesis , alterations to the localisation and abundance of the primary carboxylases PEPC and RuBisCO would be expected to occur early in the evolutionary trajectories generating C4 . Conversely , our data suggest that alterations to anatomy and cell biology were predicted to precede the majority of biochemical alterations , and that other enzymes of the C4 pathway are recruited prior to PEPC and RuBisCO ( Figure 3 ) . These enzymes , such as PPDK and C4 acid decarboxylases , function in processes not related to photosynthesis within leaves of C3 plants ( Aubry et al . , 2011 ) , so the early changes to abundance and localisation of these enzymes within C4 lineages may have been driven by non-photosynthetic pressures . A recent in silico study also predicts that changes to photorespiratory metabolism and GDC in BS cells evolved prior to the C4 pathway ( Heckman et al . , 2013 ) . Our model predicts that BS-specificity of GDC was acquired early in C4 evolution for the majority of lineages . However , we also note that the predicted timing of GDC BS-specificity is bimodal in our analysis ( Figure 3 ) , and not predicted to be acquired early in monocot lineages ( Figure 4C ) . These results suggest that this is not a feature of C4 evolution to have occurred repeatedly in all lineages . Recent evidence from physiological and ecological studies has identified a number of additional environmental pressures that may have driven the evolution and radiation of C4 lineages , including high evaporative demands ( Osborne and Sack , 2012 ) and increased fire frequency ( Edwards et al . , 2010 ) . Increased BS volume and vein density have been proposed as likely adaptations to improve leaf hydraulics under drought ( Osborne and Sack , 2012; Griffiths et al . 2013 ) , but nothing is known about how early recruitment of GDC , PPDK , and C4 acid decarboxylases ( Figure 3 ) may relate to these pressures . A better understanding of the mechanisms underlying the recruitment of these enzymes ( Brown et al . , 2011; Kajala et al . , 2012; Wiludda et al . , 2012 ) may help identify the key molecular events facilitating C4 evolution . Our data also suggest that modifications to leaf development drove the evolution of diverse C4 sub-types . For example , we find that differences in the timing of events altering leaf vascular development and BS chloroplast division occur prior to the appearance of the alternative evolutionary pathways generating the NADP-ME and NAD-ME biochemical sub-types ( Figure 4D ) . These traits are predicted to evolve prior to any alterations to the C4 acid decarboxylase enzymes that traditionally define these sub-types ( Furbank , 2011 ) . As an homologous mechanism has been shown to regulate the cell-specificity of gene expression in both NADP-ME and NAD-ME gene families in independent lineages ( Brown et al . , 2011 ) , it is unlikely that mechanisms underlying the recruitment of these enzymes drove the evolution of distinct sub-types . We therefore conclude that these different sub-types evolved as a consequence of alternative evolutionary histories in leaf development , rather than biochemical or photosynthetic pressures . This may explain why differences in the carboxylation efficiency or photosynthetic performance of different C4 sub-types have never been detected ( Furbank , 2011 ) , making the adaptive significance of different decarboxylation mechanisms difficult to explain . Instead , we propose that early evolutionary events determined the downstream phenotypes of C4 sub-types by restricting lineages to independent pathways across phenotype space . The numerous differences in leaf development and cell biology between C4 sub-types ( Furbank , 2011 ) may provide clues as to which developmental changes underlie subsequent differences in metabolic evolution . C4 photosynthesis provides an excellent example of how independent lineages with a wide range of ancestral phenotypes can converge upon similar complex traits . Several studies on more simple traits have demonstrated that convergence upon a phenotype can be specified by diverse genotypes , and thus non-homologous molecular mechanisms in independent lineages ( Wittkopp et al . , 2003; Hill et al . , 2006; Steiner et al . , 2009 ) . Taken together , our data also indicate that flexibility in the viable series of evolutionary events has also facilitated the convergence of this highly complex trait . First , we show that at least four distinct evolutionary trajectories underlie the evolution of C4 lineages ( Figure 4 ) . Second , we find no evidence for inflexible linkage between the predicted timing of distinct C4 traits ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . This diversity in viable pathways also helps explain why C4 has been accessible to such a wide variety of species and not limited to a smaller subset of the angiosperm phylogeny . A recent model for the evolution of the biochemistry associated with the C4 leaf also found that C4 photosynthesis was accessible from any surrounding point of a fitness landscape ( Heckman et al . , 2013 ) . Our study of C4 anatomy , biochemistry , and cell biology also suggests the C4 phenotype is accessible from multiple trajectories . Encouragingly , the trajectories predicted by Heckman et al . ( 2013 ) were found to pass through phenotypes of C3\u2013C4 species , despite the fact that these species were not used to parameterise the evolutionary landscape . As different mechanisms generate increased abundance and cell-specificity for the majority C4 enzymes in independent C4 lineages ( reviewed in Langdale , 2011; Williams et al . , 2012 ) , it is likely that mechanistic diversity underlies the multiple evolutionary pathways generating C4 photosynthesis and may be a key factor in facilitating the convergent evolution of complex traits . This may benefit efforts to recapitulate the acquisition of C4 photosynthesis through the genetic engineering of C3 species ( Hibberd et al . , 2008 ) , expanding the molecular toolbox available to establish C4 traits in distinct phenotypic backgrounds . \n Data from eighteen C3 , seventeen C4 , and thirty-seven C3\u2013C4 species were consolidated from 43 studies that have examined the phenotypic characteristics of C3\u2013C4 species since their discovery in 1974 ( Table 1 ) . Values for sixteen of the most widely studied C3 characteristics were recorded for each intermediate species , as well as congeneric C3 and C4 relatives where available . The majority of data on enzyme abundance and the number and size of bundle sheath ( BS ) chloroplasts were obtained from studies employing the same methodology and were thus cross-comparable ( e . g . , Goldstein et al . , 1976; Ku et al . , 1976; Ku and Edwards , 1978; Sayre et al . , 1979; Holaday et al . , 1981; Holaday and Black , 1981; Ku et al . , 1983; Adams et al . , 1986; Rajendrudu et al . , 1986; Ku et al . , 1991; Devi and Raghavendra , 1993; Bruhl and Perry , 1995; Casati et al . , 1999; Keeley , 1999 ) . These cross-comparable quantitative data were partitioned into presence absence scores using two clustering techniques , the expectation-maximisation ( EM ) algorithm and hierarchical clustering ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3 ) . EM clustering was performed using a one-dimensional mixture model with two assigned components ( e . g . , presence and absence clusters ) , allowing for variable variance between the two components of the model , and variable population size between the two components . Hierarchical clustering was performed using a complete-linkage agglomerative approach , partitioning clusters by maximum distance according to a Euclidean distance metric . This approach identifies clusters with common variance , thus contrasting with the clusters of variable variance identifiable by EM . For quantitative data not comparable with other studies ( e . g . , Ku and Edwards , 1978; Rathnam and Chollet , 1978; Rathnam and Chollet , 1979; Holaday et al . , 1984; Brown and Hattersley , 1989; Beebe and Evert , 1990; P\u2019yankov et al . , 1997; Gowik et al . , 2011 ) , values obtained for intermediate species were scored as 1 or 0 if they were closer to the values for the respective C4 or C3 controls used in the original study . For qualitative abundance data from immunoblots ( e . g . , Rosche et al . , 1994; Voznesenskaya et al . , 2007; Voznesenskaya , 2010 ) , relative band intensity was measured using ImageJ software ( Abramoff et al . , 2004 ) and abundance was scored as 1 or 0 if the band intensity value was closer to the C4 or C3 control respectively . For qualitative cell-specificity data from immunolocalisations ( e . g . Voznesenskaya et al . , 2001; Ueno et al . , 2003 , 2006; Muhaidat et al . , 2011 ) , a presence score was only assigned if the enzyme appeared completely absent from either mesophyll ( M ) or BS cells . We represent the phenotypic properties of each intermediate species as a string of L = 16 numbers ( Figure 1\u2014source data 1 ) . We will refer to these strings as phenotype strings of L loci , with each locus describing data on the corresponding phenotypic trait . In a given locus , 0 denotes the absence of a C4 trait , 1 denotes the presence of a C4 trait , and 2 denotes missing data . PCA was performed on five variables for C4 cycle enzyme activity , with missing values estimated using the EM algorithm for PCA as described by Roweis ( 1998 ) . The fundamental element underlying our analysis is a transition network P , consisting of a directed graph with 2L = 65 , 536 nodes , and the weight of the edge Pij denoting the probability of a transition occurring from node i to node j . Each node corresponds to a possible phenotype: we labeled nodes with labels li so that li was the binary representation of the phenotype at node i , and Pij takes on the specific meaning of the probability of a transition from phenotype li to phenotype lj . We made several restrictions on the structure of P . We allowed only transitions that change a given phenotype at one locus , so Pij = 0 if H ( li , lj ) \u2260 1 , where H ( b1 , b2 ) is the Hamming distance between bitstrings b1 and b2 . Transitions that changed loci with value 1 to value 0 ( steps back towards the C3 state ) were forbidden , so Pij = 0 if H ( li , l0 ) > H ( lj , l0 ) , where l0 is the phenotypic string containing only zeroes . We assume that the possibility of events involving backwards steps , and multiple simultaneous trait acquisitions constitute second-order effects which will not strongly influence the inferred evolutionary dynamics . Given the transition network P , we modelled the evolutionary trajectories that may give rise to C4 photosynthesis through the picture of a discrete analogue to a Brownian bridge , that is as a stochastic process on P with constrained start and end positions ( Revuz and Yor , 1999 ) . We enforced the start state of the process to be lC3\u2261l0=0\u20260 ( the phenotype string of all zeroes ) and the end state , through the imposed structure of P , to be lC4\u2261l2L\u22121=1\u20261 ( the string of all ones ) . The dynamics of the process between these points consisted of L steps , with a phenotypic trait being acquired at each step , and a step from node i to node j occurring with probability Pij . As many evolutionary trajectories may lead to the acquisition of the required phenotypic traits , we considered an ensemble of evolutionary trajectories for each transition network . Each member of this ensemble is started at lC3 and allowed to step across the network according to probabilities P . To compare the dynamics of a given transition network to the properties of observed biological intermediates , we pictured this ensemble of trajectories as a modification of a hidden Markov model ( HMM [Rabiner , 1989] ) . At each timestep in each individual trajectory , the process may with some probability emit a signal to the observer , with that signal being simply li , the label of the node at which the process currently resides . Over an ensemble of trajectories , a set of randomly emitted signals is thus built up ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4 ) . We define a compatibility function between two strings as ( 1 ) C ( s , t ) =\u220fi=1Lc ( si , ti ) ( 2 ) c ( si , ti ) ={1if\u00a0si=ti\u00a0or\u00a0si=2\u00a0or\u00a0ti=2;0otherwise . C ( s , t ) thus returns 1 if a signal comprising string s could be responsible for observation t once some of the loci within s have been obscured: signal s is compatible with observation t . We wish to compute the likelihood of observing biological data B given a transition network P . Under our model , this likelihood is calculated by considering the compatibility of randomly emitted signals from processes supported by P with the observed data B . We write ( 3 ) L ( P|B ) =\u220fi\u2211chains\u00a0x\u2211signals\u00a0s\u2119chain ( x|P ) \u2119emission ( s|x ) C ( s , Bi ) Here , \u2119chain ( x|P ) is the probability of specific trajectory x arising on network P , \u2119emission ( s|x ) is the probability that trajectory x emits signal s , and C ( s , Bi ) gives the compatibility of signal s with intermediate state Bi . The term within the product operator thus describes the probability that evolutionary dynamics on network P give rise to a signal that is compatible with species Bi , with the overall likelihood being the product of this probability over all observed species . The uniform and random nature of signal emission means that \u2119emission ( s|x ) is a constant if signal s can be emitted from trajectory x , and zero otherwise . Our simulation approach only produces signals which can be emitted from the trajectory under consideration , so \u2119emission ( s|x ) will always take the same constant value ( which depends on the probability of signal emissions ) . As we will be considering ratios of network likelihoods and will not be concerned with absolute likelihoods we will ignore this term henceforth . For each network P we simulate an ensemble of Nchain trajectories and , for each node encountered throughout this ensemble , we record compatibilities with each of the biologically observed intermediates . We sum these compatibilities over the ensemble , obtaining \u2211chains\u00a0x\u2119chain ( x|P ) C ( s , Bi ) . A network that does not encounter any node compatible with a particular intermediate will thus be assigned zero likelihood; networks that encounter compatible nodes many times will be assigned high likelihoods . For each transition network , we simulated Nchain = 2 \u00d7 104 individual trajectories running from C3 to C4 . This value was chosen after preliminary investigations to analyse the ability of trajectory ensembles to broadly sample available paths on networks . Given uninformative prior knowledge about the evolutionary dynamics leading to C4 photosynthesis ( specifically , our prior involves each possible transition from a given node being assigned equal probability ) , we aimed to build a posterior distribution over a suitable description of the evolutionary dynamics . We represented the dynamics supported on a network P through a matrix \u03c0 , where \u03c0i , n describes the probability that acquisition of trait i occurs at the nth step in an evolutionary trajectory . The values of matrix \u03c0i , n were built up from sampling over the ensemble of trajectories simulated on P . We used Bayesian MCMC to sample networks based on their associated likelihood values ( Wasserman , 2004 ) . At each iteration , we perturbed the transition probability of the current network P a small amount ( see below ) to yield a new trial network P\u2019 . We calculated L ( P'|B ) and accepted P as the new network if L ( P'|B ) L ( P|B ) >r , where r was taken from U ( 0 , 1 ) . For practical reasons we implemented this scheme using log-likelihoods . The perturbations we applied to transition probabilities are Normally distributed in logarithmic space: for each edge wij we used w'ij=exp ( lnwij+N ( 0 , \u03c32 ) ) . To show that this scheme obeys detailed balance , consider two states A and A' , for simplicity described by a one-dimensional scalar quantity . Consider the proposed move from A when \u0394 is the result of the random draw . This proposal is A\u2192A' if A'=exp ( lnA+\u0394 ) =Ae\u0394 , implying that A=A'e\u2212\u0394 . The probability of proposing move A\u2192A' is thus N ( x=\u0394|0 , \u03c32 ) , and the probability of proposing A\u2192A' is N ( x=\u2212\u0394|0 , \u03c32 ) . By the symmetry of the Normal distribution , these two probabilities are equal . We started each MCMC run with a randomly initialised transition matrix . We allowed 2 \u00d7 104 burn-in steps then sampled over a further 2 \u00d7 105 steps . The value \u03c3 = 0 . 1 was chosen for the perturbation kernel . These values were chosen through an initial investigation to analyse the convergence of MCMC runs under different parameterisations . We performed 40 MCMC runs for each experiment and confirmed that the resulting posterior distributions had converged and yielded consistent results . We report the posterior distributions \u2119 ( \u03c0i , n ) inferred from sampling compatible networks as above . In the coarse-grained time representation , we use \u03c0i , n'CG=\u2119 ( \u2211\u200bn=1+4 ( n'\u22121 ) 4n'\u03c0i , n ) , summing over sets of ordinals of size 4 . We used the transition network P , rather than a more coarse-grained representation of the evolutionary dynamics ( e . g . , the summary matrices \u03c0 ) , as the fundamental element within our simulations so as not to discard possible details that would be lost in a coarse-grained approach \u2013 for example , the presence of multiple distinct pathways , which may be averaged over in a summary matrix . To verify our approach , we constructed artificial data sets , consisting of sets of strings in which phenotypic traits were acquired in a single ordering . Specifically , \u03c0i , n = \u03b4i , n , so the first step always resulted in acquiring the first trait , and so on . To test the approach in a pleiotropic setting , where multiple traits were acquired simultaneously , we also constructed data sets where traits were acquired at only four timesteps , each corresponding to the simultaneous acquisition of four traits . We subjected these datasets to our inferential machinery with all data intact , and with 50% of data points occluded , to determine the sensitivity and robustness of our approach ( Figure 2A\u2013B ) . The approach accurately determines the ordering of events in both the bare and occluded cases and assigns very similar posterior probability distributions to the ordering of those traits acquired simultaneously . To compare the pathways generating C4 in monocots and eudicots , and in NADP-ME and NAD-ME sub-type lineages , we performed inference on two data sets: B1 and B2 , each comprising phenotype measurements from one of the groups of interest . We reported the posteriors on the resulting summary dynamics \u2119 ( \u03c0i , n ) as before , and for the principal components analysis ( PCA ) we sampled 103 summary dynamic matrices \u03c0i , n from the inferred posterior distribution during the Bayesian MCMC procedure , and performed PCA on these sampled matrices . When a simulated chain encountered a phenotypic node compatible with a given biological intermediate , the values of traits corresponding to missing data in the biological data were recorded . These recorded values , sampled over the sampled set of networks , allowed us to place probabilities on the values of biologically unobserved traits inferred from the encounters of compatible dynamics with the corresponding phenotypic possibilities . For example , if 70% of paths on network P pass through point 101 and 30% pass through point 001 , we infer a 70% probability that the missing trait in biological intermediate 201 takes the value 1 . Predictions were presented if the inferred probability of a \u20181\u2019 value was >75% ( predicting a \u20181\u2019 ) or <25% ( predicting a \u20180\u2019 ) . If one of these inequalities held and the limiting value fell outside one standard deviation of the inferred probability ( i . e . , for mean \u03bc and standard deviation \u03c3 , \u03bc > 0 . 75 and \u03bc \u2212 \u03c3 > 0 . 75 [predicting a \u20181\u2019] or \u03bc > 0 . 25 and \u03bc + \u03c3 < 0 . 25 [predicting a \u20180\u2019] ) , the prediction was presented as \u2018strict\u2019 . We used a dynamic programming approach to explore whether a deterministic sequence of events , with a trait Tn always being acquired at timestep n ( \u03c0i , n=\u03b4Tn , n ) , was compatible with the biological data . Performing an exhaustive search over sequences of single transitions that were compatible with the observed data , we identified several such sequences that accounted for all but one trait acquisition , but no single sequence exists that accounts for all the data . To explore the possibility of multiple traits being acquired simultaneously , we tracked acquisition probabilities for later traits given that a certain trait was acquired first . This tracking was performed over all sampled compatible networks , building up \u2018contingent\u2019 acquisition tables \u03b3 with the i , j th element given by \u2119 ( \u03c0j , 2|\u03c0i , 1=1 ) , \u2260i . If a pair of traits i and j were acquired simultaneously , we would expect \u03b3ij and \u03b3ji to both be higher than expected in the non-contingent case ( as j should always appear to be immediately acquired after i and vice versa ) . RNA was extracted from mature leaves of six Flaveria species as part of the One Thousand Plants Consortium ( www . onekp . com ) , using the hot acid phenol protocol as described by Johnson et al . ( 2012 ) ( protocol no . 12 ) . cDNA was synthesised from 0 . 5 \u00b5g RNA using Superscript II ( Life Technologies , Glasgow , U . K . ) following manufacturer\u2019s instructions . An oligo dT primer ( Roche , Basel , Switzerland ) was used to selectively transcribe polyadenylated transcripts . To each RNA sample , 1 fmol GUS transcript was added for use as an exogenous control or \u2018RNA spike\u2019 , against which measured transcript abundance was normalised as described by Smith et al . ( 2003 ) . qPCR was performed as described by Bustin ( 2000 ) using the DNA-binding marker SYBR Green ( Sigma Aldrich , St . Louis , MO ) according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions . Primers were designed using cDNA sequences for Flaveria species available at Genbank ( http://www . ncbi . nlm . nih . gov/genbank ) and synthesised by Life Technologies . Amplification was performed using a Rotor-Gene Q instrument ( Qiagen , Hilden , Germany ) , using the following cycling parameters: 94\u00b0C for 2 min , followed by 40 cycles at 94\u00b0C for 20 s , 60\u00b0C for 30 s , 72\u00b0C for 30 s , followed by a 5 min incubation at 72\u00b0C . Relative transcript abundance was calculated as described by Livak and Schmittgen ( 2001 ) .", "headings": ["Abstract", "Introduction", "Results", "Discussion", "Methods"], "keywords": ["plant biology"], "id": "elife-00961-v1"}
{"lay_summary": "Living organisms need energy to stay alive; in cells , this energy is supplied in the form of a small molecule called adenosine triphosphate , or ATP , a nucleotide that stores energy in the bonds between its three phosphate groups . ATP is present in all living cells and is often referred to as the energy currency of the cell , because it can be easily stored and transported to where it is needed . However , it is unknown why cells rely so heavily on ATP when a highly similar nucleotide called guanosine triphosphate , or GTP , could also act as an energy currency . There are several examples of proteins that originally used GTP and have since evolved to use ATP , but it is not clear why this switch occurred . One suggestion is that ATP is the more readily available nucleotide in the cell . To test this hypothesis , Updegrove , Harke et al . studied a protein that helps bacteria transition into spores , which are hardier and can survive in extreme environments until conditions become favorable for bacteria to grow again . In modern bacteria , this protein uses ATP to provide energy , but it evolved from an ancestral protein that used GTP instead . First , Updegrove , Harke et al . engineered the protein so that it became more similar to the ancestral protein and used GTP instead of ATP . When this was done , the protein gained the ability to break down GTP and release energy from it , but it no longer performed its enzymatic function . This suggests that both the energy released and the source of that energy are important for a protein\u2019s activity . Further analysis showed that the modern version of the protein has evolved to briefly hold on to ATP after releasing its energy , which did not happen with GTP in the modified protein . Updegrove , Harke et al . also discovered that the levels of GTP in a bacterial cell fall as it transforms into a spore , while ATP levels remain relatively high . This suggests that ATP may indeed have become the source of energy of choice because it was more available . These findings provide insights into how ATP became the energy currency in cells , and suggest that how ATP is bound by proteins can impact a protein\u2019s activity . Additionally , these experiments could help inform the development of drugs targeting proteins that bind nucleotides: it may be essential to consider the entirety of the binding event , and not just the release of energy .", "article": "Hydrolysis of nucleoside triphosphates releases similar amounts of energy . However , ATP hydrolysis is typically used for energy-intensive reactions , whereas GTP hydrolysis typically functions as a switch . SpoIVA is a bacterial cytoskeletal protein that hydrolyzes ATP to polymerize irreversibly during Bacillus subtilis sporulation . SpoIVA evolved from a TRAFAC class of P-loop GTPases , but the evolutionary pressure that drove this change in nucleotide specificity is unclear . We therefore reengineered the nucleotide-binding pocket of SpoIVA to mimic its ancestral GTPase activity . SpoIVAGTPase functioned properly as a GTPase but failed to polymerize because it did not form an NDP-bound intermediate that we report is required for polymerization . Further , incubation of SpoIVAGTPase with limiting ATP did not promote efficient polymerization . This approach revealed that the nucleotide base , in addition to the energy released from hydrolysis , can be critical in specific biological functions . We also present data suggesting that increased levels of ATP relative to GTP at the end of sporulation was the evolutionary pressure that drove the change in nucleotide preference in SpoIVA . \n Nucleotides have various functions in the cell , as coenzymes , signaling messengers , and the building blocks of genetic material . Nucleoside triphosphates ( NTPs ) store energy in the form of their phosphate bonds . The free energy of the hydrolysis reaction involving the bond between the \u03b2- and the \u03b3-phosphates is approximately 30 kJ/mol ( Berg et al . , 2007 ) and is used to drive a variety of energy-consuming biochemical reactions . Despite this similarity between different NTPs , enzymes usually display strong preferences toward a specific NTP . For example , adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) in general is the principal source of energy in a cell and is used by motor proteins to perform work , whereas hydrolysis of guanosine triphosphate ( GTP ) typically functions as a timer or switch , such as in proteins involved in signal transduction ( Alberts , 2002 ) . One explanation for this dichotomy is that the relative intracellular abundance of ATP in a cell drove the evolution of motors to use it as an energy source ( Bennett et al . , 2009; Rudoni et al . , 2001; Traut , 1994 ) . Consistent with that notion , the eukaryotic ATPase motor proteins myosin and kinesin are evolutionarily members of the TRAFAC class of GTPases , having emerged from an ancestral GTPase , but have switched their nucleotide specificity to utilizing the more abundant nucleotide ATP to perform their energy-intensive functions ( Leipe et al . , 2002 ) . In this report , we examine an unusual bacterial ATPase named SpoIVA ( Ramamurthi and Losick , 2008; Roels et al . , 1992 ) that is also from the TRAFAC class of GTPases and is exclusively found in sporulating members of the Firmicutes phylum ( Castaing et al . , 2013 ) . We had previously shown that within the TRAFAC group , SpoIVA is closest to the Era GTPases ( Castaing et al . , 2013 ) which are switches involved in the maturation of 16S rRNA and assembly of the 30S ribosomal subunit and universally conserved across bacteria ( Ji , 2016 ) . Given the universal conservation of Era among bacteria and the narrow conservation of SpoIVA , we proposed a model in which SpoIVA emerged via a duplication event followed by rapid divergence from Era ( Castaing et al . , 2013 ) . This divergence from Era included not only multiple residue substitutions , but also the addition of two C-terminal domains in SpoIVA that are not present in Era ( Figure 1B , C ) . Further , the most parsimonious explanation of the phyletic patterns of SpoIVA and Era is that they are not formally sister groups where both diverged from a common ancestor; rather , SpoIVA ATPase , which emerged specifically in sporulating Firmicutes , has the Era GTPase itself as its ancestor . Unlike myosin and kinesin , SpoIVA is not a motor protein . Instead SpoIVA is a cytoskeletal protein that assembles into a static polymer in an ATP hydrolysis-dependent manner ( Ramamurthi and Losick , 2008 ) . In the absence of an obvious motor function , which would necessitate high ATP utilization , the selective pressure that drove the evolution of nucleotide preference in SpoIVA has been unclear . SpoIVA is essential for bacterial endospore formation ( Galperin et al . , 2012; Roels et al . , 1992 ) . When Bacillus subtilis faces starvation , it metamorphoses into a structurally and chemically robust dormant cell type termed an endospore ( hereafter a \u2018spore\u2019 ) that protects the cell\u2019s genetic material from environmental insults ( Higgins and Dworkin , 2012; Setlow , 2006; Stragier and Losick , 1996; Tan and Ramamurthi , 2014 ) . Spores are encased in a proteinaceous shell , termed the spore \u2018coat\u2019 , a complex structure that is composed of\u00a0~80 proteins ( Driks and Eichenberger , 2016; Henriques and Moran , 2007; McKenney and Eichenberger , 2012 ) . Assembly of the coat begins with the construction of a basement layer , of which the major structural protein is SpoIVA ( McKenney et al . , 2010; Peluso et al . , 2019; Price and Losick , 1999; Ramamurthi et al . , 2006; Ramamurthi and Losick , 2008; Roels et al . , 1992 ) . Unlike dynamic cytoskeletal proteins like actin and tubulin , where nucleotide binding drives polymerization and nucleotide hydrolysis is linked to polymer disassembly ( Pollard and Goldman , 2018 ) , SpoIVA polymerization requires ATP hydrolysis to form a nucleotide-free static polymer ( Castaing et al . , 2013; Wu et al . , 2015 ) . The amino terminal half of the SpoIVA ATPase is the nucleotide-binding domain , which belongs to the TRAFAC class of P-loop GTPases ( Figure 1A\u2013C; Castaing et al . , 2014; Castaing et al . , 2013; Leipe et al . , 2002 ) . This domain harbors a Walker A motif that binds the \u03b3-phosphoryl group of the bound ATP ( Walker et al . , 1982 ) , a Walker B motif that coordinates a Mg2+ ion required for ATP hydrolysis and , like TRAFAC GTPases , a sensor Thr ( \u2018sensor T\u2019 ) that detects the \u03b3-phosphoryl of the bound nucleotide to trigger ATP hydrolysis ( Leipe et al . , 2002 ) . The classic TRAFAC GTPases which hydrolyze GTP contain a fourth motif ( the so-called G4 motif ) , typically consisting of Asn and Lys separated by one residue before an Asp ( NKxD ) that confers guanine-binding specificity ( Leipe et al . , 2002 ) . Crystal structures revealed direct interactions between the side chain of the Asp and the base of a bound GTP through two H-bonds , and a coordination of a water molecule to the \u03b1-phosphate group of the bound nucleotide by the Lys ( Knihtila et al . , 2015 ) . Additionally , the extended aliphatic side chain of the said Lys forms a hydrophobic wall to hold the guanine of the nucleotide in the active site . Substitution of the Asp in this motif with Asn abolished the guanine-binding specificity of Ras , also a GTPase of the TRAFAC clade , and switched its specificity to xanthine ( Kang et al . , 1994; Weijland et al . , 1994; Zhong et al . , 1995 ) . Additionally , in TRAFAC GTPases the loop spatially adjacent to the NKxD motif ( the so-called G5 motif ) is proximal to the guanine and might contribute to some extent to their guanine specificity . To understand the functional requirement for the evolution of SpoIVA from a GTPase to an ATPase , we sought to reformulate the active site of SpoIVA to mimic its ancestral GTPase activity by restoring the NKxD motif , which is altered in SpoIVA , and by altering an SxE sequence in the loop associated with the G5 motif . We found that partial restoration of the NKxD motif and alteration of the SxE sequence resulted in a SpoIVA variant that hydrolyzed GTP in vitro slightly preferentially over ATP with reduced overall catalytic efficiency , similar to the in vitro activity of the Era GTPase from which SpoIVA was likely derived in the ancestral sporulating Firmicute ( Castaing et al . , 2013 ) . In parallel , disrupting the NKxD motif in Era and introducing the SxE sequence into the G5 motif to mimic SpoIVA resulted in an Era variant that preferentially hydrolyzed ATP in vitro . The altered SpoIVA was able to harness the energy released by GTP or ATP hydrolysis to drive a necessary conformational change in the protein but failed to ultimately polymerize specifically in the presence of GTP . We show that this was due to the inability of SpoIVA to form the equivalent of an ADP-dependent multimer in the presence of GTP , which we show is a necessary intermediate en route to functional SpoIVA polymerization . Additionally , we provide evidence that the extant SpoIVA polymerizes more efficiently than the altered variant in the presence of lower ATP concentration , similar to what is present during the end of sporulation . We propose that a pronounced reduction in intracellular GTP concentration relative to ATP during the late stages of sporulation could have driven the evolution of SpoIVA to utilize ATP instead of GTP to drive polymerization , a critical step in the morphogenesis of the spore cell surface . \n Our earlier sequence-profile analysis along with site directed mutagenesis had shown SpoIVA to be a member of the TRAFAC class of GTPases with Era as its closest GTPase relative ( Castaing et al . , 2013 ) . Since SpoIVA is strictly restricted to the clade of Firmicutes that form endospores we reasoned that SpoIVA was a relatively late innovation that evolved via gene duplication and rapid divergence from Era . Given that Era is a functional GTPase and SpoIVA shows a clear preference for ATP over GTP ( Ramamurthi and Losick , 2008 ) we sought to identify the potential changes in the active site that might have led to this shift in specificity . For relatively closely related proteins that diverged from a common ancestor , reconstruction of an ancestral state may be achieved based on phylogeny and using statistical methods across the entire length of the proteins ( Hochberg and Thornton , 2017 ) . However , the phyletic patterns strongly indicate that the ultimate ancestor of SpoIVA was Era itself . Moreover , SpoIVA and Era have diverged too far from each other to successfully employ such an approach . Beyond myriad amino acid substitutions and insertions , SpoIVA has even acquired two C-terminal domain fusions that are not present in Era ( Figure 1C; Castaing et al . , 2014 ) , which is reminiscent of other examples where the acquisition of large appendages to ancestral proteins have generated novel functions beyond the ancestral function ( Escudero et al . , 2020; Farr et al . , 2017 ) . Thus , the number of variables involved when all residues are considered would result in too vast of a parameter space to analyze using a common ancestor reconstruction method . We therefore focused on the highly conserved N-terminal TRAFAC NTPase domain of SpoIVA and computed a sequence logo for SpoIVA , Era and various other families of the TRAFAC class of GTPases , especially those of the GIMAP-Septin-Dynamin clade which show a comparable tendency for forming oligomers or polymers ( Figure 1A ) . Next , the amino acid conservation pattern of SpoIVA was superimposed on a topology diagram of the ancestral core TRAFAC GTPase domain ( Figure 1B ) . This allowed us to identify those conserved active site positions which were retained in the ancestral state in SpoIVA and those that were altered with respect to bona fide GTPases ( Figure 1C ) . The first three motifs ( G1\u20133 ) respectively correspond to: the Walker A motif which binds the triphosphate of the NTP substrate; the sensor T which discriminates the GTP-bound state from the GDP-bound state; and the Walker B motif which chelates the catalytic Mg2+ and senses the bound triphosphate along with the sensor T ( G2 ) motif ( Figure 1A , B ) . In SpoIVA , these three motifs are retained in the ancestral state indicating that SpoIVA binds and senses the triphosphate moiety of the NTP similar to the ancestral GTPases ( Castaing et al . , 2013; Figure 1B\u2013E ) . In contrast , notable changes are seen in the G4 and G5 motifs of SpoIVA . Of these , G4 is comprised of the final residue of strand 6 of the core GTPase domain and a characteristic single-turn helix that follows it ( Figure 1B , C ) . Among the GTPases closely related to SpoIVA , the G4 motif is of the form NKxD ( where \u2018x\u2019 is any amino acid ) , for\u00a0example , in Era and Eng ( Figure 1A ) . The first position of this motif is typically either N or T in most families of the entire GTPase superfamily . Thus , SpoIVA retains the ancestral state in this position . This residue forms the \u2018lower wall\u2019 of the base-binding pocket of the active site and by itself does not appear to discriminate between the purines ( Figure 1D , E ) . The next position is a K in most families of bona fide GTPases ( Figure 1A ) and the extended sidechain of this lysine forms the \u2018lateral wall\u2019 of the base-binding pocket ( Figure 1D ) . Strikingly , this K is consistently substituted by an alcoholic ( S/T ) residue in the SpoIVA family . The next conserved position in G4 is the D , which is the most important determinant of guanine specificity ( Figure 1D ) . In SpoIVA it is again mostly substituted by either of several polar residues , such as K , H , N , or R . Notably , unlike in bona fide GTPases this position is poorly constrained in SpoIVA , suggesting a relaxation of selection , which might have allowed the emergence of ATP selectivity . The G5 motif follows immediately after strand-7 of the core GTPase domain and typically displays the motif SAx in classical TRAFAC GTPases . This region forms the wall of the base-binding pocket opposite to that formed by the conserved lysine in G4 ( Figure 1D ) . In the case of SpoIVA the position corresponding to the conserved S in the G5 motif is less constrained and is usually either N , D , or S . The next residue is usually a cysteine in SpoIVA . Hence , this residue is likely to be similar to A with respect to its hydrophobicity and is not situated close to the distinguishing atoms of the purine base of the bound nucleotide . Thus , it is unlikely to have a major effect on base selectivity . Two residues downstream of S , there is a position that contributes to the wall of the base-binding pocket . This position is not particularly conserved in TRAFAC GTPases as a whole but in SpoIVA is either acidic ( D/E ) or Q/N in 41% of the orthologs . Together , these observations suggested that the changes in the G4 ( NKxD ) and G5 ( SxE ) regions relative to the bona fide GTPases may have contributed to the emergence of ATP-specificity in SpoIVA ( Figure 1E ) . To determine the relative contributions of the altered NKxD and SxE motifs in G4 and G5 , respectively , on nucleotide hydrolysis specificity of SpoIVA , we first substituted different residues in each motif , either individually or in several combinations . Next , we overproduced and purified the variants from E . coli and tested the efficiency of each variant in hydrolyzing ATP and GTP in vitro . As a control , we compared these activities to that of B . subtilis Era GTPase that we purified using a similar protocol . We measured nucleotide hydrolysis for each variant at increasing nucleotide concentrations to produce saturation curves that revealed the substrate turnover rate ( kcat ) and nucleotide concentration that produced half-maximal enzymatic activity ( Km ) ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1 , Supplementary file 2 ) . We then calculated the catalytic efficiency for each reaction ( kcat/Km ) which reflects how likely the forward reaction ( hydrolysis of the bound nucleotide ) will proceed ( Figure 2A , Supplementary file 2 ) . Wild-type ( WT ) SpoIVA displayed a catalytic efficiency of 4 . 2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00 . 9 min\u22121 mM\u22121 for ATP , compared to just 1 . 3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00 . 8 min\u22121 mM\u22121 for GTP , indicating that the protein hydrolyzed ATP approximately threefold more efficiently than GTP ( Figure 2B ) . By comparison , Era did not display appreciable basal ATPase or GTPase activity , but upon incubation with an RNA oligonucleotide corresponding to the 16S rRNA sequence to which Era binds and which reportedly stimulates the enzymatic activity of Era ( Meier et al . , 2000; Tu et al . , 2011 ) , Era hydrolyzed GTP with a catalytic efficiency of 0 . 7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00 . 2 min\u22121 mM\u22121 , similar to the reported activity of E . coli Era ( Tu et al . , 2011 ) . However , Era did not specifically hydrolyze ATP , as evidenced by the failure of the reaction to reach saturation and display Michaelis\u2013Menten kinetics ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1J , Figure 2A , \u2018I . D . \u2019 for \u2018indeterminable\u2019 ) . Restoring the Asp in the degenerate NKxD motif of SpoIVA did not significantly change the catalytic efficiencies of ATP or GTP hydrolysis but restoring either the Lys or full NKxD motif in SpoIVA resulted in a\u00a0~2 . 5-fold increase in the catalytic efficiency for ATP and\u00a0~3 . 5-fold of that for GTP hydrolysis . Restoring either the single Lys or the full NKxD motif resulted in decreased preference for ATP ( Figure 2B ) . Curiously , these variants also displayed an unusually high turnover rate that was\u00a0~10-fold higher for both NTPs than that displayed by WT SpoIVA ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C , D ) . We next investigated if altering the SxE sequence in SpoIVA would reduce the unusually high enzymatic activity resulting from restoration of the NKxD motif . Substituting both the Ser and Glu with Ala ( to disrupt both positions with an amino acid with a short sidechain that is unlikely to perturb overall SpoIVA structure ) in the context of the restored NKxD motif resulted in lowered catalytic efficiencies , similar to WT SpoIVA ( Figure 2A , C: \u2018NKxD AxA\u2019 ) . This change also increased the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme for GTP , resulting in drastically reduced specificity for ATP relative to WT SpoIVA ( Figure 2B ) . Changing the SxE sequence alone to AxA had a similar effect ( Figure 2A , \u2018NSxR AxA\u2019 ) . Substituting the Glu alone in the SxE sequence with Ala ( \u2018NSxR SxA\u2019 ) mimicked the NSxR AxA variant with respect to nucleotide specificity ( Figure 2B ) , but further lowered the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme ( Figure 2A ) . Finally , combining a restoration of just the Asp residue of the degenerate NKxD motif with disruption of just the Glu of the SxE sequence , resulted in an enzyme that displayed a similar catalytic efficiency to that of Era ( Figure 2A , \u2018NSxD SxA\u2019; hereafter referred to as \u2018SpoIVAGTPase\u2019; Figure 2C ) with a slight preference for GTP over ATP ( Figure 2B ) . To test if altering the G4 NKxD motif and introducing the SxE sequence in G5 were sufficient for the emergence of preferential ATPase activity , we changed the NKxD motif in Era to NSxR , to resemble the G4 sequence in SpoIVA , and substituted a glutamate at the end of the SAx sequence in Era to produce \u2018SAE\u2019 ( thereby introducing an SxE motif ) and tested the nucleotide hydrolysis activity of the evolved variant . Similar to WT Era , the evolved Era ( EraATPase ) did not exhibit a basal NTPase activity , but upon stimulation with the 16S rRNA fragment , EraATPase hydrolyzed ATP with a catalytic efficiency of 0 . 2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00 . 1 min\u22121 mM\u22121 ( Figure 2A ) , but more curiously failed to specifically hydrolyze GTP ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1K ) . The key alterations in shifting the NTPase activity of SpoIVA toward that of Era were to restore the Asp of the NKxD and replace the Glu of the SxE ( Figure 2C ) . Conversely , disrupting the NKxD motif of Era and introducing a Glu to create an SxE motif were sufficient to drive the preferential hydrolysis of ATP over GTP . The mutational analyses therefore indicate that the Asp of the NKxD motif contributes to nucleotide specificity and that the substitution of Asp to Arg seen in the extant B . subtilis SpoIVA contributes to altering the nucleotide-binding pocket to discriminate against GTP in favor of ATP . This is consistent with reported crystal structures of TRAFAC GTPases with a bound GTP ( Knihtila et al . , 2015 ) that show that the Asp of the NKxD motif can interact with the base of the bound nucleotide . In addition , another report showed that changing the Asp to another residue can alter the nucleotide-binding preference of Ras GTPase from GTP to xanthine triphosphate ( XTP ) ( Kang et al . , 1994; Weijland et al . , 1994; Zhong et al . , 1995 ) . The Glu in the SxE sequence further contributes to ATP hydrolysis specificity and likely stabilizes the binding of ATP over GTP . To ensure that the amino acid substitutions introduced to restore ancestral SpoIVA GTPase activity did not completely abrogate protein function , we tested the ability of the different variants to complement the sporulation defect caused by a deletion of the spoIVA gene in B . subtilis . Deletion of spoIVA resulted in a\u00a0>108-fold and a\u00a0~106-fold reduction in the production of heat resistant spores and lysozyme-resistant spores , respectively ( Roels et al . , 1992 , Figures 3A\u00a0and Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A , Supplementary file 2 ) , which could be complemented in trans by the introduction of WT spoIVA at an ectopic chromosomal locus . In contrast , while expression of the NSxD variant ( which displayed similar enzymatic activity as WT SpoIVA in vitro; Figures 2A\u00a0and Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B , Supplementary file 2 ) complemented the spoIVA deletion , complementation by the hyperactive NKxR or NKxD variants resulted in\u00a0>108-fold and\u00a0~104-fold decreases in the production of heat-resistant spores , respectively . Similarly , mutants that harbored a spoIVA allele containing a full substitution of the SxE sequence ( resulting in AxA ) also largely failed to sporulate when the G4 motif also harbored alterations ( Figures 3A\u00a0and , Supplementary file 2; NKxD AxA and NKxR AxA ) . Immunoblot analysis of extracts prepared from sporulating cells revealed that these SpoIVA variants were produced at levels similar to WT SpoIVA ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B ) . In an otherwise WT background , though , the AxA substitution ( NSxR AxA ) sporulated at near WT levels . Interestingly , SpoIVAGTPase ( NSxD SxA ) , which showed reduced but similar hydrolysis of ATP and GTP ( Figure 2 ) , supported sporulation at near WT levels ( Figures 3A\u00a0and Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A , Supplementary file 2 ) . Although we cannot determine which nucleotide SpoIVAGTPase utilized in vivo , we can conclude that this disruption of the nucleotide-binding pocket did not result in either a large-scale structural defect in the protein that catastrophically affected its function or reduced its accumulation in vivo . We next examined the subcellular localization in vivo during sporulation of each variant fused to green fluorescent protein , expressed from an ectopic chromosomal locus under control of the native spoIVA promoter . WT GFP-SpoIVA localized to the surface of the forespore ( Figure 3B , B\u2019 ) , as did the NSxD variant which sporulated at near-WT levels ( Figure 3C , C\u2019 ) . However , restoring only the Lys of the degenerate G4 motif or restoring the entire NKxD motif in an otherwise WT SpoIVA resulted in the mis-localization of the variant as a focus near the surface of the forespore . Ala substitution of the SxE sequence along with the NKxD motif resulted in a similar mis-localization pattern ( Figure 3D\u2013F , D\u2019\u2013F\u2019 ) . In contrast , various disruptions to the SxE sequence alone did not abrogate localization of the variant ( Figure 3G\u2013I , G\u2019\u2013I\u2019 ) . Finally , SpoIVAGTPase localized similar to WT ( Figure 3J\u2013J\u2019 ) , consistent with its ability to support sporulation at a near-WT level . Thus , disruption of the nucleotide-binding pocket of SpoIVA to permit the slightly preferential hydrolysis of GTP over ATP resulted in a protein that largely retained proper function in vivo . Although the sporulation efficiency and subcellular localization data indicated that SpoIVAGTPase was largely functional , it was difficult to infer if this variant used ATP or GTP to perform its function in vivo . We therefore monitored the nucleotide hydrolysis-driven conformational change and polymerization of SpoIVA in vitro in the presence of either nucleotide . Structural changes in SpoIVA may be monitored by limited trypsin proteolysis ( Castaing et al . , 2013 ) . We therefore incubated purified WT SpoIVA or variants with a low concentration of trypsin and assessed the extent of proteolysis at different time points by separating the reaction by Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE . Importantly , the experiment was performed using 2 \u00b5M SpoIVA , which is below the critical concentration for SpoIVA polymerization ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A; Castaing et al . , 2013 ) , and therefore reflective of polymerization-independent conformational changes in the protein . In the absence of nucleotide , SpoIVA was rapidly degraded , resulting in a characteristic banding pattern ( Figure 4A ) . In contrast , co-incubation with either ATP or GTP resulted in a different banding pattern: most noticeably , the full-length protein was considerably resistant to degradation even after 10 min , suggestive of a massive conformational change in the protein upon hydrolysis of either nucleotide . The disappearance of full-length SpoIVA was quantified to produce a decay rate which indicated that a conformational change in WT SpoIVA could be achieved at an approximately similar rate by hydrolysis of either by ATP or GTP ( Figure 4B ) . In contrast , restoring the Lys alone , the entire NKxD motif alone , or in combination with the entirely disrupted SxE sequence ( to AxA ) resulted in a rapid decay rate in the presence of either ATP or GTP , indicating that these variants were unable to achieve the characteristic nucleotide-dependent conformational change , consistent with the observed in vivo defects of these variants ( Figure 3 , Supplementary file 2 ) . However , variants harboring substitution of either the Ser or Glu singly or together in the SxE sequence with Ala or SpoIVAGTPase displayed a decay rate in the presence of either nucleotide that was more similar to WT SpoIVA , suggesting that that these variants were able to utilize the energy released from hydrolysis of either ATP or GTP to drive the conformational change in the protein that is a prerequisite for polymerization ( Castaing et al . , 2013 ) . To further understand the nucleotide hydrolysis requirement for driving the conformational change in SpoIVA , we employed the limited trypsin digestion assay with SpoIVA and key SpoIVA variants using different nucleotides: ATP-\u03b3-S and GTP-\u03b3-S , which are non-hydrolyzable analogs of ATP and GTP; ADP and GDP; and ADP-AlFx and GDP-AlFx , which are nucleotide analogs that mimic the transition state of ATP and GTP in the hydrolysis reaction ( Chen et al . , 2007; Coleman and Sprang , 1999 ) . In the presence of ATP-\u03b3-S or GTP-\u03b3-S , WT SpoIVA displayed an intermediate conformational change suggesting that the protein bound , but did not hydrolyze , the nucleotide ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1L , M ) , whereas SpoIVA harboring a Walker A disruption ( SpoIVAA* , which prevents ATP binding [Ramamurthi and Losick , 2008] ) did not undergo a similar conformational change ( Figures 4C , D\u00a0and Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A-B ) . Consistent with this result , the SpoIVA variant harboring a Sensor T disruption ( SpoIVAT* , which binds , but does not hydrolyze ATP [Castaing et al . , 2013] ) displayed a similar conformational change as WT SpoIVA in the presence of ATP-\u03b3-S and GTP-\u03b3-S ( Figures 4D\u00a0and Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1C ) , and SpoIVAT* binding to ATP . Together , this suggested that this intermediate conformational change is likely due to nucleotide binding and not due to slow hydrolysis of the bound nucleotide . Interestingly , the NKxD variant of SpoIVA , which exhibited elevated ATP and GTP hydrolysis levels ( Figure 2A ) , displayed a conformational change in the presence of ATP-\u03b3-S and GTP-\u03b3-S similar to SpoIVAA* ( Figures 4D\u00a0and Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1D ) , suggesting that it did not stably undergo the initial conformational change that occurs upon binding the nucleotide . WT SpoIVA and SpoIVAT* exhibited a similar intermediate conformational change when incubated with ADP or GDP , but not the full conformational change that occurred upon nucleotide hydrolysis ( Figure 4E ) . A similar intermediate conformational change upon binding GDP relative to binding GTP has been reported for other TRAFAC GTPases ( Coleman and Sprang , 1999 ) . Similar to the non-hydrolyzable nucleotides , SpoIVAT* and the NKxD variant did not display any conformational change when incubated with ADP or GDP ( Figure 4E ) . Curiously , incubation of WT SpoIVA with either ADP-AlFx or GDP-AlFx ( Figure 4F ) produced a conformational change that was similar to that produced upon full hydrolysis of the nucleotide ( Figure 4B , C ) . This suggested that the transition state mimics the activated state facilitated by ATP hydrolysis that is responsible for the conformational change seen in Figure 4A . As controls , incubation of the SpoIVAT* , which is devoid of the alcoholic residue found to be critical for stabilizing the transition state of the protein-nucleotide complex in TRAFAC GTPases ( Coleman and Sprang , 1999; Leipe et al . , 2002 ) , SpoIVAA* , or the NKxD variant with ADP-AlFx or GDP-AlFx did not exhibit a similar conformational change ( Figure 4F ) . Taken together , the results suggest that simply binding to ADP or GDP is insufficient to produce the full conformational change in SpoIVA required for polymerization . Instead , hydrolysis of an NTP molecule , while bound to the active site , is required for rearranging SpoIVA into a polymerization-competent state . The data are also consistent with a model in which rapid turnover of the bound NTP is incompatible with producing such a conformational change . Next , we tested the nucleotide-dependent polymerization rates of the SpoIVA variants by measuring the size distribution of polymerized SpoIVA molecules over time using dynamic light scattering ( DLS ) . Incubation of purified WT SpoIVA , above the critical concentration for polymerization , with ATP , but not GTP , resulted in a steady increase in hydrodynamic radius ( Rh ) over a 5 hr period , consistent with ATP-dependent polymerization and what we previously observed ( Castaing et al . , 2013; Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A ) . The initial slope of the polymerization reaction in the presence of nucleotide was quantified and reported relative to the initial slope of the reaction in the absence of nucleotide to yield polymerization rates for SpoIVA ( Figure 5A , Supplementary file 2 ) . This ratio revealed a greater than\u00a0~30% increase in polymerization rate with ATP than GTP ( Figure 5A , Supplementary file 2 ) , surprisingly indicating that the conformational change in SpoIVA driven by GTP hydrolysis ( Figure 4A , B , E ) , which appeared similar to the conformational change driven by ATP hydrolysis , did not yield isomers of SpoIVA that were capable of polymerization . We next examined the ability of SpoIVA variants in polymerizing with ATP and GTP . Restoring the Asp in the G4 motif , which did not display any obvious defect in the other assays , only slightly lowered the polymerization rate with ATP ( Figures 5A\u00a0and Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B; Supplementary file 2 ) . However , all variants that harbored a restoration of the Lys in the G4 motif were unable to polymerize with either nucleotide ( Figures 5A\u00a0and Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1C-E; Supplementary file 2 ) , suggesting that substitutions leading to elevated nucleotide hydrolysis were unable to ( 1 ) induce a conformational change , ( 2 ) were defective in vivo , and ( 3 ) were also unable to promote SpoIVA polymerization . Disruptions to the SxE sequence lowered , but did not abolish , SpoIVA polymerization in the presence of ATP , but none of these variants polymerized in the presence of GTP ( Figure 5A , Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1F-H; Supplementary file 2 ) . Likewise , SpoIVAGTPase , which was functional in vivo ( Figure 3 ) , and could use either ATP or GTP to induce a similar conformational change after nucleotide hydrolysis ( Figure 4A , B ) , only polymerized in the presence of ATP ( Figures 5A\u00a0and Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1I; Supplementary file 2 ) , suggesting a specific requirement for the nucleotide base , not simply the energy released from nucleotide hydrolysis , for its function . Reported crystal structures of the eukaryotic septin GTPases , which also belong to the TRAFAC class of P-loop GTPases , show a dimer in which each monomer binds to a molecule of GDP that is stabilized by contacts from the other monomer with the guanosine base ( Zeraik et al . , 2014 ) . Fully polymerized SpoIVA is devoid of any bound nucleotide ( Castaing et al . , 2013 ) , but we wondered if SpoIVA would form an intermediate multimeric complex en route to polymerization whose formation would be dependent specifically on ADP binding before the hydrolyzed nucleotide was released . To test this , we first incubated 2 \u00b5M purified SpoIVA , below the threshold concentration for polymerization ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A ) , either in the\u00a0absence of nucleotide or in the presence of ATP or GTP , and then separated the products by size exclusion chromatography ( SEC ) . In the absence of nucleotide or the presence of GTP , SpoIVA migrated as a single peak ( Figure 5B , top left; pink and gray traces ) . Quantitative mass imaging of this peak by employing interferometric scattering mass spectrometry ( iSCAMS ) ( Young et al . , 2018 ) revealed a mass of 103\u00a0\u00b1\u00a012 kDa ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2A ) , similar to a predicted mass for a SpoIVA dimer of 114 kDa . Diluting the peak into a low salt buffer revealed an additional peak at 59\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08 kDa , similar to the predicted mass for a SpoIVA monomer of 57 kDa , along with the presumed dimeric peak of 109\u00a0\u00b1\u00a014 kDa corresponding to a SpoIVA dimer ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2B ) . Addition of ATP resulted in shifting most of the protein to the void volume of the SEC column , indicating the formation of a larger complex ( Figure 5B , top left; blue trace ) , even though the experiment was performed using a SpoIVA concentration that was below its critical concentration for polymerization ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A ) . In contrast , neither SpoIVAT* in the presence ATP or GTP , nor WT SpoIVA in the presence of either ATP-\u03b3-S or ADP , formed a larger complex , indicating that ATP , but not GTP , hydrolysis is required for producing the species in the void volume ( Figure 5B , top right and bottom left ) . Interestingly , incubation of SpoIVAGTPase with ATP , but not GTP , partially shifted a population into the void volume ( Figure 5B , bottom right ) , indicating that the reengineered SpoIVAGTPase retained its specific dependence on ATP instead of GTP in forming the polymerization-competent intermediate , despite being able to hydrolyze both NTPs . Since the mass of the void volume peak was varied and too large to examine using iSCAMS , we employed size exclusion with multi-angle light scattering ( SEC-MALS ) analysis ( Some et al . , 2019 ) , which revealed a range of molecular weights ranging from 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0103 kDa to 106 kDa , suggesting multimers containing at least\u00a0~36 monomers of SpoIVA ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2C ) . Examination of this void volume by negative stain and transmission electron microscopy revealed a species with a distinct structure that extensively self-interacted ( Figure 5D ) . To check if this larger SpoIVA species may harbor an associated nucleotide , we examined the same peaks that eluted from the SEC column using 254 nm wavelength . Incubating WT SpoIVA or SpoIVAGTPase with GTP did not reveal a significant absorbance at 254 nm for fractions containing protein ( Figure 5C , top left and bottom right; pink traces ) , but the protein peaks of the sample in the void volume when incubated with ATP displayed significant absorbance at 254 nm ( Figure 5C , blue traces ) , suggesting the presence of nucleotide in this fraction . Neither SpoIVAT* incubated with ATP nor WT SpoIVA incubated with ATP-\u03b3-S or ADP displayed significant absorbance at 254 nm ( Figure 5C , top right and bottom left ) , suggesting that the nucleotide present in the void volume multimer of WT SpoIVA is likely ADP retained in the active site after hydrolysis . To confirm this , we extracted the nucleotide from the void volume fraction by denaturing the protein . Separation of the extracted material by SEC revealed that it eluted at a similar volume as ADP , not ATP ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3 ) . We next tested if the SpoIVA-ADP complex in the void volume observed in Figure 5B is a functional intermediate that can subsequently polymerize once its concentration exceeds the threshold concentration for polymerization . We therefore first incubated purified SpoIVA at low concentration ( 2 \u00b5M , below the threshold concentration for polymerization; Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A ) in the presence and absence of ATP . Half of each sample was then subjected to buffer exchange by SEC to remove free nucleotide . The desalted protein was then concentrated 20-fold using pressure dialysis after which polymerization was assayed by the formation of insoluble SpoIVA in the pellet fraction after ultracentrifugation ( Figure 5E ) . In parallel , select supernatant and pellet fractions were separated by SEC to detect ATP and ADP ( Figure 5F\u2013J ) . Only samples that were incubated with ATP and whose concentration was increased displayed appreciable SpoIVA in the pellet fraction ( Figure 5E ) . Importantly , removing free ATP prior to concentrating the sample also resulted in SpoIVA polymerization , suggesting that pre-incubation with ATP produces a functional ADP-bound SpoIVA multimeric intermediate that can polymerize once its threshold concentration for polymerization is subsequently achieved . Interestingly , while the protein-containing pellet fraction did not contain any bound nucleotide ( Figure 5J; Castaing et al . , 2013 ) , the supernatant fraction contained ATP and ADP ( Figure 5I ) , likely from ATP-bound SpoIVA that had not polymerized and consistent with the release of ADP upon SpoIVA polymerization . Taken together , the results are consistent with a model in which SpoIVA , at a low concentration that does not promote polymerization , hydrolyzes ATP to undergo a conformational change and subsequently assembles into heterogeneous high molecular weight multimers that retain the ADP product of hydrolysis . Upon an increase in concentration , this functional SpoIVA multimeric intermediate releases the bound ADP and forms a nucleotide-free mature polymer . In contrast , while hydrolysis of GTP drove a conformational change in SpoIVA similar to what was achieved with ATP hydrolysis ( Figure 4A , B ) , GTP hydrolysis did not permit formation of the high molecular weight intermediate ( and therefore did not permit polymerization ) , nor did the protein retain GDP after hydrolysis ( Figure 5B , C ) . As sporulation proceeds , intracellular ATP levels 2\u00a0hr after the induction of sporulation were reported to reach a high of\u00a0~1 . 5 mM while the level of GTP drops to a low of\u00a0<0 . 06 mM ( Lopez et al . , 1981; Lopez et al . , 1979; Ochi et al . , 1982; Ochi et al . , 1981 ) . This relative abundance of ATP could therefore explain the evolutionary pressure that drove the switch in nucleotide-binding preference from GTP to ATP in SpoIVA . However , the time point at which these measurements were performed is before SpoIVA exerts its function during sporulation . We therefore harvested sporulating cells at various time points by vacuum filtration , extracted total nucleotides using organic solvent , and employed liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry ( LC-MS ) to quantify the relative abundance of individual nucleotides ( Figure 6A\u2013D ) . Immediately after induction of sporulation , ATP levels remained relatively constant ( Figure 6A; blue trace , compare \u2018pre-induction\u2019 to 0 hr; Supplementary file 3 ) , but increased almost twofold by the first hour , before returning to pre-sporulation levels in the second hour . At t\u00a0=\u00a03 . 5 hr , when SpoIVA is actively assembling the spore coat basement layer ( Peluso et al . , 2019; Price and Losick , 1999 ) , ATP levels were\u00a0~70% of pre-sporulation levels; by t\u00a0=\u00a05 hr , ATP levels were less than 35% of pre-sporulation levels . Assuming a B . subtilis cell volume of 2 . 38 fL and using calculated LC-MS detection efficiencies for ATP and GTP ( Fung et al . , 2020 ) , this corresponds to a pre-induction intracellular concentration of ATP of 2 . 3 mM\u00a0\u00b10 . 89 mM in casein hydrolysate media; the concentration of ATP 3 . 5 hr after the induction of sporulation corresponds to 1 . 6 mM\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00 . 25 mM , and 0 . 81 mM\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00 . 084 mM at t\u00a0=\u00a05 hr , after achieving a concentration of 4 . 5 mM\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00 . 044 mM at t\u00a0=\u00a01 hr . In contrast , GTP , which was present initially at 0 . 65 mM\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00 . 33 mM plummeted to 0 . 071 mM\u00a0\u00b10 . 034 mM immediately upon induction of sporulation ( Figure 6A , pink trace; Supplementary file 3 ) . Over the next 3 . 5 hr , GTP levels rose\u00a0approximately threefold , and ended up twofold higher than at t\u00a0=\u00a00 after 5 hr . This corresponded to an\u00a0approximately\u00a0eightfold excess of ATP over GTP at t\u00a0=\u00a03 . 5 hr ( intracellular concentration of 0 . 20 mM\u00a0\u00b10 . 034 mM GTP ) , and an\u00a0approximately\u00a0fivefold excess of ATP at t\u00a0=\u00a05 hr ( intracellular concentration of 0 . 16 mM\u00a0\u00b10 . 012 GTP ) . The relative amounts of CTP and UTP were lower than that of ATP during the first 5 hr of sporulation ( Figure 6A ) , but slightly higher than that of GTP . Consistent with the increase in ATP level in the first hour of sporulation , the levels of ADP and AMP increased approximately\u00a0twofold immediately upon induction of sporulation ( Figure 6B , C , Supplementary file 3 ) . Curiously , not only did the nucleotide alarmone ppGpp increase\u00a0~30-fold immediately upon induction of sporulation ( Figure 6D , orange trace; Supplementary file 3 ) to 0 . 11 mM\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00 . 088 , similar to what was previously reported ( Ochi et al . , 1982 ) , but the newly discovered guanosine nucleotide alarmone pGpp , which is produced by hydrolysis of ( p ) ppGpp ( Yang et al . , 2020 ) , also increased\u00a0~30-fold immediately ( 0 . 19 mM\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00 . 10 mM at t\u00a0=\u00a00 hr ) after sporulation was induced . Since SpoIVAGTPase functioned similar to the extant ( WT ) SpoIVA in vivo with respect to sporulation efficiency and localization ( Figures 3\u00a0and Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A; Supplementary file 2 ) , we wondered if the extant SpoIVA evolved to more efficiently utilize ATP at physiological nucleotide concentrations , in a way that was not evident by measuring sporulation efficiency by heat and lysozyme resistance ( Figures 3A\u00a0and\u00a0Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A ) . Both SpoIVA and SpoIVAGTPase failed to undergo nucleotide hydrolysis-mediated structural changes in the presence of 0 . 06 mM GTP at sub-polymerization levels of the protein but did so in the presence of 1 . 5 mM ATP ( Figure 6E , F ) . However , when we examined SpoIVA polymerization at different concentrations of ATP , we observed that while neither SpoIVA nor SpoIVAGTPase were able to polymerize in the presence of 0 . 06 mM ATP ( Figure 6G ) , WT SpoIVA , but not SpoIVAGTPase , was able to efficiently polymerize in the presence of an intermediate concentration of ATP ( 1 . 5 mM; Figure 6G ) , similar to what was observed for WT SpoIVA using 4 mM ATP . Thus , although SpoIVAGTPase promiscuously hydrolyzed ATP and GTP ( Figure 2A , Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1J ) and could polymerize with excessive ATP ( albeit at a slower rate; Figures 5A and 6G ) , it was unable to polymerize under limiting concentration of ATP ( Figure 6G ) . The limiting amounts of ATP ( 1 . 5 mM , the approximate amount of intracellular ATP between 3 . 5 hr and 5 hr of sporulation ) therefore suggests a selective pressure that could have driven the initial amino acid substitutions required to switch nucleotide preference from GTP to ATP in SpoIVA and subsequent substitutions to enhance polymerization activity . \n In this study we examined an unusual bacterial cytoskeletal protein , SpoIVA , that hydrolyzes ATP to drive the formation of static polymers . We previously reported that the SpoIVA ATPase is ancestrally derived ( Castaing et al . , 2013 ) from an Era-like GTPase , a pan-bacterial ribosomal maturation protein belonging to the TRAFAC class of P-loop GTPases ( Leipe et al . , 2002 ) . We proposed that this likely occurred via a gene duplication event followed by a rapid divergence from the ancestral gene ( Castaing et al . , 2013 ) . To understand the selective pressure underlying the switch in nucleotide specificity of the extant SpoIVA and the mechanistic details governing its function , we sought to restore its ancestral enzymatic ( GTPase ) activity by re-engineering its nucleotide-binding pocket and examining how the altered protein functioned in vivo and in vitro . Achieving this required altering amino acids in two loops near the base of the bound NTP ( Figure 1 ) . First , we partially restored the highly conserved NKxD motif on the G4 loop that has been implicated in conferring GTP-binding specificity ( Dever et al . , 1987 ) and is highly conserved among GTPases ( Leipe et al . , 2002 ) , but is altered in SpoIVA . Second , we altered the sequence ( SxE in B . subtilis SpoIVA ) in the G5 loop that is less conserved among GTPases ( SAx ) . This approach resulted in a protein whose enzymatic activity operated in a parameter space similar to that of the ancestral Era GTPase and hydrolyzed GTP with a slight preference over ATP in vitro ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2 and 1 ) . Additionally , the altered protein was able to exploit the energy released by hydrolysis of either ATP or GTP to drive a critical conformational change required for polymerization ( Figure 4A , B ) . Despite the ability of this protein to undergo an initial conformational change upon hydrolyzing either nucleotide , the protein only polymerized in the presence of ATP ( Figure 5A ) , suggesting that the nucleotide base , and not just the energy released from nucleotide hydrolysis , was required for protein function . This requirement for ATP led us to propose that the scarcity of GTP during the late stages of sporulation ( Figure 6A ) could have helped drive the evolution of SpoIVA to preferentially utilize ATP . Indeed , amino acid starvation and the onset of stationary phase are known to result in a reduction in GTP and GDP levels , which coincides with an increase in the production of the nucleotide alarmones ( p ) ppGpp ( Kriel et al . , 2012; Liu et al . , 2015; Ochi et al . , 1981 ) . This drop in GTP level has also been implicated in the initiation of sporulation in B . subtilis ( Lopez et al . , 1979; Ochi et al . , 1982 ) , possibly through derepressing the activity of the CodY transcription factor that represses sporulation initiation genes by directly sensing GTP via its ligand-binding GAF domain ( Aravind and Ponting , 1997; Brinsmade , 2017; Sonenshein , 2005 ) . Here , we showed that GTP and GDP scarcity continued even 3 . 5\u20135 h after the initiation of sporulation , when SpoIVA is actively assembling the spore coat ( Peluso et al . , 2019 ) , which suggests a selective pressure that drove the switch in nucleotide specificity in SpoIVA from GTP to ATP . Consistent with this notion , we observed that physiological levels of intracellular ATP , but not GTP , facilitate the requisite conformational changes in SpoIVA and SpoIVAGTPase ( Figure 6E , F ) . This pressure caused by low levels of GTP is likely constrained by the fact that ( p ) ppGpp actively inhibits GTP production; in fact , artificially elevating GTP levels during nutrient limitation was shown to be detrimental to the cell ( Kriel et al . , 2012 ) . Thus , the apparent requirement for low GTP levels during sporulation likely drove SpoIVA to utilize the more abundant ATP , rather than force the cell to generate more GTP . One puzzling observation was that SpoIVAGTPase , which promiscuously hydrolyzed ATP and GTP , functioned similar to the extant SpoIVA in vivo ( Figure 3 ) , which led us to wonder why the protein needed to have evolved further . However , when we employed a more sensitive assay which monitored the kinetics of SpoIVA polymerization in vitro , we found that , at an intermediate concentration of ATP that resembles the in vivo intracellular concentration of ATP during the late stages of sporulation ( Figure 6A ) , the extant SpoIVA polymerized more robustly than did SpoIVAGTPase . Thus , after GTP levels have dropped at the end of the sporulation program , and when ATP also gradually depletes , the extant SpoIVA has apparently evolved to better utilize ATP to drive efficient polymerization . We can speculate that the evolution from hydrolyzing GTP to ATP likely started with changing the Lys in the NKxD motif of Era to Ser in the ancestral SpoIVA , since any combination of SpoIVA mutants tested in this study that retain the Lys was not functional in vivo ( Figure 3 ) or in vitro ( Figure 4 ) , likely due to elevated nucleotide hydrolysis ( Figure 2 and Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . Thus , this substitution appears to have modulated the enzyme activity , probably allowing the appropriate conformational changes to occur upon nucleotide binding . The next likely change was the loss of the Asp in the G4 NKxD motif , which was shown previously to confer GTP specificity to other TRAFAC GTPases ( Cool et al . , 1999 ) , and which resulted in a slight increase in catalytic efficiency and preference for ATP ( Figure 2A , B ) , yet did not abrogate SpoIVA function in vivo and in vitro ( Figures 3\u00a0and\u00a04 ) . Finally , the substitutions in the G5 loop such as the emergence of a polar position two residues downstream of the serine ( Glu in B . subtilis ) in the G5 loop of the extant SpoIVA contributed to the higher catalytic efficiency and preference for ATP we observe in vitro ( Figure 2 ) and the more efficient polymerization we observed at the lower ATP levels ( Figure 6G ) . Consistent with this model we find this mutational route to yield the most direct stepwise progression of catalytic efficiency of NTP hydrolysis from Era to extant SpoIVA ( Figure 2C ) . Our studies also revealed a stable polymerization intermediate that could explain the specific functional dependence of SpoIVA on ATP . At a low concentration of SpoIVA , which did not permit polymerization , we observed that SpoIVA formed a heterogeneous population of high molecular weight multimers in the presence of ATP , and not GTP ( Figures 5B\u00a0and Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2C ) . Further experiments revealed that formation of these multimers required ATP hydrolysis and that , in the absence of polymerization , the multimers bound the hydrolyzed nucleotide ( ADP ) ( Figures 5C\u00a0and Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3 ) and were capable of polymerizing after subsequent removal of free ATP ( Figure 5E\u2013J ) . Our working model for SpoIVA polymerization ( Figure 7 ) proposes that ATP hydrolysis results in the formation of high molecular weight SpoIVA multimers that stably bind ADP ( when SpoIVA is present below the critical concentration for polymerization ) . Several GTPases of the septin-GIMAP-dynamin clade within the TRAFAC class form oligomeric or polymeric assemblies typically in the proximity of lipid membranes and are involved in several aspects of membrane dynamics ( Schwefel et al . , 2010 ) . SpoIVA represents a further independent example of the emergence of such polymerization activity within the TRAFAC class . However , some aspects of its dynamic oligomerization into higher order structures specifically resemble certain members of the septin-GIMAP-dynamin clade of GTPases . In particular , the ADP-dependent multimerization of SpoIVA is reminiscent of the manner in which septins multimerize when bound to GDP ( Zeraik et al . , 2014 ) . Since the final SpoIVA polymer is nucleotide-free ( Figure 5J; Castaing et al . , 2013 ) , the model predicts that polymerization of SpoIVA multimers , which only occurs when the concentration of SpoIVA exceeds a threshold concentration , releases the bound ADP ( Figure 7 ) . The transient binding of ADP to a polymerization intermediate is consistent with our previous observation that while phosphate is rapidly released upon ATP hydrolysis , release of the resulting ADP is slightly delayed ( Castaing et al . , 2013 ) . In contrast , although the extant SpoIVA can hydrolyze GTP ( Figures 2A\u00a0and Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A ) , the residues required to retain the hydrolyzed nucleotide are presumably no longer present , resulting in GDP release , which precludes formation of the NDP-bound multimeric intermediate required for polymerization ( Figure 7B ) . This situation in a static structural protein , where either nucleotide may be accommodated but only one nucleotide promotes full function , is reminiscent of the binding of GTP by the enzyme adenylate kinase , wherein GTP binding arrests the protein in a catalytically inhibited conformation , but ATP binding permits large structural changes in the enzyme required for catalysis ( Rogne et al . , 2018 ) . Multiple examples in biology feature GTP-binding proteins that most commonly exploit nucleotide binding and hydrolysis as a timer or switch to relay a signal , whereas ATP is usually used by proteins participating in energy-intensive processes to perform work ( Alberts , 2002 ) . Since SpoIVA ultimately forms a static polymer and does not perform obvious work like a motor protein , the purpose of its ATP utilization had been mysterious . One implication of our model is that SpoIVA retained the ancestral \u2018switch\u2019 function of TRAFAC GTPases ( nucleotide hydrolysis-dependent triggering of a conformational change ) . Indeed , it is likely that the precursor of SpoIVA was initially recruited for a structural role due to the capacity of GTPases to form nucleotide-dependent oligomeric assemblies in proximity to membranes as also observed in the GIMAP-septin-dynamin clade . However , as it became fixed for this function in the context of sporulation , SpoIVA appears to have substituted ATP for GTP as the molecule that mediates the switch because of the relative scarcity of GTP during the late stages of sporulation ( Figure 6A; Lopez et al . , 1981; Lopez et al . , 1979; Ochi et al . , 1982; Ochi et al . , 1981 ) . Functionally , this activity also resembles that of certain ATPases in the STAND clade of P-loop NTPases of the AAA+ class ( Leipe et al . , 2004 ) . These NTPases , which include the apoptosis regulator Apaf-1 and the bacterial AfsR-like transcription regulators , employ ATP ( and in some cases GTP ) hydrolysis to transmit a conformational change to an effector domain to convey a signal , rather than perform a motor function ( Danot et al . , 2009; Leipe et al . , 2004 ) . In the future , detailed structural analyses of SpoIVA will likely yield insights into additional residues that evolved to increase the specificity of ATP binding and provide an atomic-scale mechanism for ATP-dependent multimerization and polymerization . \n Starting sets of members of each GTPase family were collected by running BLASTP searches ( Altschul et al . , 1997; Aravind and Koonin , 1999 ) against a database of 4440 complete genomes and 2983 metagenomes ( coding for a total of 21 , 646 , 808 proteins ) obtained from the genomes division of Genbank ( ftp://ftp . ncbi . nlm . nih . gov/genomes/ ) . These were then filtered by similarity-based clustering with the BLASTCLUST program ( https://www . ncbi . nlm . nih . gov/Web/Newsltr/Spring04/blastlab . html ) to obtain the representative sets for each family . They were then aligned using the Kalign program ( Lassmann et al . , 2009; Lassmann and Sonnhammer , 2005 ) and further improved by examining GTPase structures . The multiple sequence alignments thus obtained were used to compute the sequence logos for each family . The logos were computed using the codebase obtained from RWeblogo ( https://CRAN . R-project . org/package=RWebLogo ) with the residue size scaled as per the probability of their occurrence in a column of the alignment . The NTPase active site pockets were drawn using the MarvinSketch program ( https://chemaxon . com/products/marvin ) . His6-tagged SpoIVA was overproduced in E . coli BL21 ( DE3 ) from plasmid pJP120 ( WT SpoIVA ) ( Castaing et al . , 2013 ) or pJP120 derivatives ( SpoIVA variants constructed via QuikChange kit , Agilent ) and purified using Ni2+ affinity chromatography ( Qiagen ) and subsequently by ion-exchange chromatography ( Mono Q; Pharmacia ) as described previously ( Wu et al . , 2015 ) . Briefly , 4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0500 ml cultures of BL21 ( DE3 ) harboring pJP120 or derivatives [pIL48 ( spoIVAS189K ) , pIL49 ( spoIVAR191D ) , pIL50 ( spoIVAS189K , R191D ) , pJH25 ( spoIVAS189K , R191D , E218A ) , pJH26 ( spoIVAS189K , R191D , S216A ) , pJH27 ( spoIVAS189K , R191D , S216A , E218A ) , pTU141 ( spoIVAS216A , E218A ) , pTU142 ( spoIVAS216A ) , pTU143 ( spoIVAE218A ) , and\u00a0pTU220 ( spoIVAR191D , E218A ) ] were grown at 37\u00b0C in Terrific Broth ( Fisher Scientific ) containing 50 mg/ml kanamycin for plasmid maintenance to mid-logarithmic phase ( ~2 . 5 hr ) . Isopropyl-\u03b2-D-thiogalactopyranoside ( Calbiochem , Millipore ) was added to 1 mM \ufb01nal concentration to induce protein production and each culture was grown for 4 hr at 37\u00b0C . Harvested cells ( which could be stored at \u221280\u00b0C ) were resuspended in 25 ml of ice-cold Buffer A ( 50 mM Tris at pH 7 . 5 , 150 mM NaCl ) and disrupted by French Pressure Cell Press ( SLM Aminco ) at 12 , 000 psi . All subsequent steps were performed on ice . Unbroken cells and cell debris were removed by centrifugation at 35 , 000 rpm for 1 hr at 4\u00b0C and the cleared lysate was loaded on a single gravity column containing 3 ml of Ni-NTA agarose ( QIAGEN ) , pre-equilibrated with ice-cold Buffer A , and incubated on ice for 30 min . Upon flow-through of the clarified lysate , the column was washed with 50 ml Wash Buffer I ( Buffer A containing 20 mM imidazole ) , followed by 4 ml Wash Buffer II ( Buffer A containing 80 mM imidazole ) . Protein was eluted with 10 ml ice-cold Elution buffer ( Buffer A containing 250 mM imidazole ) . Imidazole was removed from eluted fractions using a PD-10 desalting column ( GE Healthcare; 3 . 3 ml eluate/PD-10 desalting column ) and eluted using 4 ml Buffer A . Peak fractions were identi\ufb01ed using NanoDrop A280 ( ND-1000 , Thermo Scientific ) , pooled , separated by ion exchange chromatography ( Mono Q 5/50 , GE Healthcare ) , and then eluted with a step-wise gradient of 150\u20131000 mM NaCl; His6-SpoIVA routinely eluted at 0 . 4 M NaCl . Puri\ufb01ed protein was stored at 4\u00b0C and was used in less than 48 hr after puri\ufb01cation due to precipitation of the protein upon prolonged storage . For long-term storage , samples were flash-frozen on dry ice and stored at \u221280\u00b0C . To assess the multimerization of SpoIVA and variants , 2 \u00b5M purified WT or T* SpoIVA variant ( Castaing et al . , 2013 ) was incubated with no NTP , 4 mM ATP , or 4 mM GTP in Buffer B ( 50 mM Tris at pH 7 . 5 , 400 mM NaCl , 5 mM MgCl2 ) for 4 hr at 37\u00b0C . 700 \u00b5l of each sample was then passed through a 0 . 22 \u00b5m filter and separated using a Superose 6 Increase 10/300 GL size exclusion column ( GE Healthcare ) with Buffer B at a flow rate of 0 . 2 ml/min . For assessing the presence of ATP and ADP , where indicated , samples were heated at 95\u00b0C for 20 min to release protein bound nucleotide , centrifuged to remove insoluble material , and the supernatant separated using Superdex 30 Increase 10/30 GL size exclusion column ( GE Healthcare ) with 50 mM Tris at pH 7 . 5 at a flow rate of 0 . 2 ml/min . Retention volumes were compared to that of free ATP and ADP standards ( Sigma ) . his6-tagged era gene was PCR-amplified using primers ( 5\u2019-GGGGAATTGTGAGCGGATAACAATTC which abutted an XbaI restriction site , and 5\u2019-GCTTGTCGACGGAGCTCGAATTCGGATCTTAATATTCGTCCTCTTTAAAGCCAAAATC which abutted a BamHI restriction site and six histidine codons ) from B . subtilis PY79 chromosomal DNA and cloned into vector pET28a strain to generated plasmid pJH17C . His6-tagged Era was overproduced in E . coli BL21 ( DE3 ) from plasmid pJH17C or pTU281 ( harboring His6-tagged EraK125S , D127R , L156E variant constructed via QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit , Agilent ) and purified using Ni2+ affinity chromatography ( Qiagen ) and subsequently by ion-exchange chromatography similar to purification of SpoIVA . However , since Era is positively charged at neutral pH , imidazole elutions were further separated by ion exchange chromatography using Mono S column ( Mono S 5/50 , GE Healthcare ) instead of Mono Q . Puri\ufb01ed protein was either stored at \u221280\u00b0C , after quick freeze on dry-ice , for long-term storage , or stored at 4\u00b0C and used within 48 hr . Different concentrations ( ranging from 0 to 4 mM ) of ATP or GTP ( Sigma ) were incubated with 0 . 3 \u03bcM purified His6-SpoIVA or SpoIVA variants , or His6-Era or Era variants in 50 \u03bcl Buffer B for 1 hr at 37\u00b0C . For reactions with Era and Era variants , 1 mM of the oligonucleotide rAUCACCUCCUUUCUA ( corresponding to B . subtilis 3\u2019 end of the 16S rRNA ) was added to the reaction prior to the addition of NTPs in order to stimulate Era hydrolysis ( Tu et al . , 2011 ) . Concentration of released inorganic phosphate was determined using Malachite Green Phosphate Assay kit ( BioAssay Systems ) according to manufacturer\u2019s protocol . Briefly , reactions were stopped by the addition of 950 \u03bcl of water; 80 \u03bcl of diluted reaction was added to a single well of a flat-bottom 96-well plate ( Costar ) . 20 \u03bcl of Malachite Green working reagent was added to each well and the reaction was incubated at room temperature for 30 min . Absorbance at 620 nm ( Spark 10M plate reader , Tecan ) of each reaction was compared to absorbances of known concentrations of phosphate standards . Absorbances from control reactions performed in the absence of SpoIVA for each NTP concentration were subtracted from absorbances of the respective reactions with SpoIVA to eliminate background hydrolysis . Hydrolysis rates for each NTP concentration were plotted using GraphPad Prism 7; Vmax and Km values were determined by fitting the data to Michaelis\u2013Menten equation using best-fit values . Limited proteolysis of His6-SpoIVA and variants by partial trypsin digest was conducted as previously described ( Castaing et al . , 2013 ) . Briefly , 2 \u03bcM His6-SpoIVA was incubated in 100 \u03bcl of Buffer B supplemented with 4 mM NTP for 4 hr at 37\u00b0C . After addition\u00a0of 1 \u03bcg/ml of trypsin ( Sigma; diluted in 20 mM MgCl2 , 1 mM HCl ) , 15 \u03bcl of the reaction was removed and added at the indicated time points ( 0 , 2 , 5 , and 10 min ) to 5 \u03bcl of 4\u00d7 LDS Sample Buffer ( Invitrogen ) containing beta-mercaptoethanol ( Sigma ) and heated at 95\u00b0C for 30 min to arrest proteolysis . 10 \u03bcl of each sample was separated by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie blue . The intensity of the full-length His6-SpoIVA band in each lane was quantified using ImageJ software ( NIH ) , plotted as a function of time , and fitted to single-phase exponential decay using GraphPad Prism 7; reaction rates from each His6-SpoIVA variant were normalized to the reaction rate of WT protein . Fluorescence microscopic images of WT and mutant B . subtilis were taken as previously described ( Ebmeier et al . , 2012 ) . Briefly , overnight cultures of B . subtilis grown in casein hydrolysate ( CH ) media at 22\u00b0C were diluted 1:20 into 20 ml CH and grown at 37\u00b0C for 2 hr . Sporulation was induced via resuspension method ( Sterlini and Mandelstam , 1969 ) in A+B media supplemented with 80 \u03bcg/ml threonine ( Sigma ) at 37\u00b0C . After 3 . 5 hr , cells were harvested and resuspended in PBS ( KD Medical ) containing 1 \u00b5g/ml FM4-64 ( Invitrogen ) to visualize membranes , then placed on lysine-coated glass bottom dish ( MatTek Corp . ) under a 1% agarose pad . Cells were viewed with a DeltaVision Core microscope system ( Applied Precision ) equipped with an environmental control chamber . Images were captured with a Photometrics CoolSnap HQ2 camera . Seventeen planes were acquired every 0 . 2 \u03bcm at 22\u00b0C , and the data were deconvolved using SoftWorx software ( GE Healthcare ) . At the sporulation time points that we examined , phase bright forespores had not yet developed; thus , the auto\ufb02uorescence of forespores was not higher than background \ufb02uorescence . Additionally , control experiments with sporulating strains that did not harbor a gfp fusion indicated that the level of GFP \ufb02uorescence from fusions to SpoIVA was well above the limited background \ufb02uorescence of the cells . To determine sporulation ef\ufb01ciencies , WT and mutant B . subtilis cells were grown in Difco Sporulation Medium for at least 24 hr at 37\u00b0C . Cultures were then exposed to 80\u00b0C for 20 min to kill non-sporulating cells . Surviving cells were enumerated by serial dilution and plating on LB agar . Viable spores were counted as colony forming units ( CFUs ) ; sporulation efficiencies were reported as a ratio to CFUs recovered from a parallel experiment using WT B . subtilis . Steady state levels of SpoIVA and variants were assessed via immunoblotting as previously described ( Tan et al . , 2015 ) . Briefly , B . subtilis cells were induced to sporulate via resuspension as described above . Sporulating cells were harvested and resuspended in 500 \u03bcl protoplast buffer ( 0 . 5 M sucrose , 10 mM K2PO4 , 20 mM MgCl2 , and 0 . 1 mg/ml lysozyme [Sigma] ) and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 30 min with shaking at 300 rpm . Protoplasts were harvested by centrifugation and lysed by resuspension in 200 \u03bcl PBS buffer . 15 \u03bcl of the sample was combined with 5 \u03bcl of 4\u00d7 LDS sample buffer ( NuPAGE ) , separated by SDS-PAGE , and transferred to PVDF membranes ( Novex ) using iBlot ( Invitrogen ) . Blots were blocked in 5% skim milk ( Carnation ) in Tris-buffered saline ( TBS ) /Tween ( TBS + 1% Tween 20; Sigma ) overnight at 4\u00b0C with gentle shaking . Blots were incubated for 1 hr with antiserum raised against purified SpoIVA and detected using anti-rabbit IgG StarBright ( Bio-Rad ) with a ChemiDoc MP imager ( BioRad ) . Mass Photometry ( MP , iSCAMS ) experiments were carried out on a OneMP instrument ( Refeyn , Oxford , UK ) at room temperature . Rectangular 24 \u00d7 50 mm coverslips ( #12544E , Fisher Scientific ) and square 24 \u00d7 24 mm coverslips ( #1405\u201310 , Globe Scientific ) were prepared by rinsing with water , ethanol , and isopropanol , and dried with clean nitrogen gas ( Young et al . , 2018 ) Approximately 10 \u00b5l of protein was loaded into the channel formed by stacked coverslips . MP signals were recorded for 100 s to allow detection of at least 2 \u00d7 103 individual protein molecules . Raw MP data were processed in DiscoverMP software ( Refeyn , Oxford , UK ) and plotted as molar mass distribution histograms . For SEC-MALS , experiments were performed on a Agilent Series 1100 System ( Agilent ) with Superdex200 Increase 10/300 GL column ( GE Healthcare ) , Helleos-II in-line multi angle light scattering detector ( Wyatt Technology ) , and Optilab T-rEX refractive index detector ( Wyatt Technology ) . SEC column was equilibrated with Buffer B until a stable refractive index baseline was reached . For sample analysis , 100 \u00b5l of SpoIVA at 0 . 94 mg/ml concentration in the presence of 4 mM ATP was injected at the 0 . 5 ml/min flow rate . All experiments were performed at room temperature , with MALS and RI detectors equilibrated at 20\u00b0C . Chromatograms were analyzed in ASTRA ( V7 . 1 , Wyatt Technology ) , and refractive index increment of 0 . 185 ml/g was used to determine the protein concentration . Negative staining of the protein samples was performed on glow-discharged carbon-coated grids . For each condition , 3 . 5 \u00b5l sample was applied to a grid and incubated for 40 s . Excess sample was blotted away using a filter paper . The grid was then stained with 3 . 5 \u00b5l 1% uranyl acetate solution for 1 min and air-dried for imaging . Digital micrographs were collected using a 2 k CCD camera on a Hitachi 7650 electron microscope at an accelerating voltage of 80kV . Cells were grown in CH media to OD600nm ~0 . 5 and induced to sporulate via the resuspension method as described above . Metabolite extraction was performed as described previously ( Yang et al . , 2020 ) . Briefly , 10 ml culture were sampled and harvested by filtration through PTFE membrane ( Sartorius ) at time points before and after resuspension in A+B media . Pellets on the PTFE membranes were soaked in 3 ml extraction solvent mix ( on ice 50:50 [v/v] chloroform/water ) and then vortexed to quench metabolism and extract metabolites . Cell extracts were centrifuged at 5000 \u00d7 g for 10 min to remove the organic phase , and then centrifuged at 20 , 000 \u00d7 g for 10 min to remove cell debris . Samples were frozen at \u221280\u00b0C if not analyzed immediately . Samples were analyzed using LC-MS and the metabolites were quantified as described previously ( Fung et al . , 2020; Yang et al . , 2020 ) , using an HPLC-MS system consisting of a Vanquish UHPLC system linked to electrospray ionization ( ESI , negative mode ) to a Q Exactive Orbitrap mass spectrometer ( Thermo Scientific ) operated in full-scan mode to detect targeted metabolites based on their accurate masses . LC was performed on an Acquity UPLC BEH C18 column ( 1 . 7 \u03bcm , 2 . 1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0100 mm; Waters ) . Total run time was 30 min with a flow rate of 0 . 2 ml/min , using Solvent A ( 97:3 [v/v] water/methanol , 10 mM tributylamine , and 10 mM acetic acid ) and acetonitrile as Solvent B .

{"lay_summary": "Leptin is a hormone that keeps us healthy in many ways . It regulates our body weight by reining in our appetite and fine-tuning the energy we burn , and it helps us establish and maintain our fertility . It also participates in brain development . Leptin performs these roles by attaching to specific receptors in nerve cells and relaying relevant information to the brain . Early events can trigger life-long changes in the way our body works , a process called metabolic programming . Leptin is believed to participate in this reprogramming mechanism , but its role remains uncertain . In particular , it is still unclear which leptin-driven changes are permanent , and which ones are reversible . Being able to distinguish between the two types of alterations would help to better grasp the role leptin plays in early development . Here , Ramos-Lobo et al . examined genetically engineered mice born without a working leptin receptor . These animals were impervious to the effects of leptin . Then , once the rodents were adults , they were treated with a drug that restored their leptin receptors , making them sensitive to the hormone again . These experiments revealed that mice without leptin receptors during early life developed obesity , were less able to lose weight and burned less energy . Their reproductive success was also compromised . Finally , the lack of leptin during development caused permanent reduction of the animals\u2019 brains , and changes in the activity of certain genes in the organ . The work by Ramos-Lobo et al . indicates that in mice , lacking leptin sensibility early in life conditions the body to permanently become \u2018thrifty\u2019 , burning less energy and making it harder to lose weight . It is rare for humans to be born completely without leptin activity . Yet , having too much or too little food as a baby affects the level of the hormone , or our sensitivity to it: this may permanently change the way our bodies manage energy . Ultimately , learning more about these mechanisms could help us ward off or treat obesity .", "article": "Leptin regulates energy balance and also exhibits neurotrophic effects during critical developmental periods . However , the actual role of leptin during development is not yet fully understood . To uncover the importance of leptin in early life , the present study restored leptin signaling either at the fourth or tenth week of age in mice formerly null for the leptin receptor ( LepR ) gene . We found that some defects previously considered irreversible due to neonatal deficiency of leptin signaling , including the poor development of arcuate nucleus neural projections , were recovered by LepR reactivation in adulthood . However , LepR deficiency in early life led to irreversible obesity via suppression of energy expenditure . LepR reactivation in adulthood also led to persistent reduction in hypothalamic Pomc , Cartpt and Prlh mRNA expression and to defects in the reproductive system and brain growth . Our findings revealed that early defects in leptin signaling cause permanent metabolic , neuroendocrine and developmental problems . \n The hormone leptin is best known as a key signal to the brain conveying information about body energy reserves ( Maffei et al . , 1995 ) . Consequently , leptin receptor ( LepR ) -expressing neurons are apt to modulate food intake and energy expenditure according to the amount of energy stored and the current energy balance ( Ramos-Lobo and Donato , 2017 ) . Hence , null mutations in the genes that encode for leptin or LepR impair the capacity of the hypothalamus to regulate energy homeostasis , leading to profound metabolic dysfunctions in humans and rodents , including severe obesity , hyperphagia , low-energy expenditure , hypoactivity , insulin resistance and infertility ( Halaas et al . , 1995; Montague et al . , 1997; Farooqi et al . , 2002; Licinio et al . , 2004 ) . In addition to the role of leptin in energy homeostasis , other studies have shown that leptin can affect developmental processes , especially in the brain ( Ahima et al . , 1999 ) . Regarding this aspect , rodents exhibit a postnatal leptin surge between the first and second week of age that is not associated to changes in fat mass or food intake ( Ahima et al . , 1998 ) . In addition , 2-week-old mice do not respond to the anorexigenic effects of leptin ( Mistry et al . , 1999 ) . Thus , leptin does not seem to be involved in the regulation of energy balance during the first weeks of life in mice . However , synaptic plasticity in the hypothalamus is regulated by leptin ( Pinto et al . , 2004 ) . Leptin signaling is also required for the formation of the neural projections from the arcuate nucleus ( ARH ) to post-synaptic targets , a process that takes place in the first 2 weeks of life ( Bouret et al . , 2004a; Kamitakahara et al . , 2018 ) . In accordance , leptin promotes neurite outgrowth in vitro and leptin-deficient ( Lepob/ob ) mice show disruption of ARH neural projections ( Bouret et al . , 2004b ) . Importantly , exogenous leptin rescues the development of ARH projections of Lepob/ob mice only when provided in the neonatal period . Thus , these findings suggest that the lack of leptin signaling in the first weeks of life permanently disrupts these projections in mice ( Bouret et al . , 2004b ) . Important implications arise from the developmental effects of leptin . For example , changes in leptin signaling during development could then affect the organization of critical neural circuits that regulate energy homeostasis , favoring the incidence of metabolic diseases later in life . Thus , leptin may also be involved in the developmental programming ( Ralevski and Horvath , 2015 ) . Accordingly , early postnatal leptin blockage in rats leads to long-term leptin resistance and susceptibility to diet-induced obesity ( Attig et al . , 2008 ) . Furthermore , neonatal leptin treatment reverses the developmental programming caused by maternal undernutrition ( Vickers et al . , 2005 ) . However , it is worth mentioning that despite the aforementioned evidence about leptin\u2019s developmental effects , exogenous leptin replacement can reverse key metabolic abnormalities exhibited by leptin-deficient mice or humans ( Pelleymounter et al . , 1995; Ioffe et al . , 1998; Farooqi et al . , 2002; Licinio et al . , 2004; Donato et al . , 2011 ) . Therefore , the actual importance of leptin signaling during development for the long-term energy homeostasis and other aspects regulated by leptin is not yet fully understood . Thus , to uncover the role of leptin during development , we investigated the long-term consequences of the absence of leptin signaling in early life . For this purpose , we studied knockout mice for the Lepr gene that grew without leptin\u2019s effects . However , LepR expression was restored either at the fourth or tenth week of life . Our findings revealed that some defects previously considered irreversible due to the lack of leptin signaling in the neonatal period , such as the poor development of ARH neural projections , can be recovered by LepR reactivation in adulthood . On the other hand , the absence of leptin signaling in early life permanently impairs energy homeostasis , the melanocortin system , as well as the reproduction and brain development . \n To study the importance of leptin signaling during development , we used the LepRNull mouse model that carries a transcription blocker between exons 16 and 17 of the Lepr gene ( Berglund et al . , 2012 ) , preventing the expression of the long LepR isoform ( Lepr-b ) . As expected , adult male and female LepRNull mice were morbidly obese and hyperphagic ( Figure 1A\u2013D ) . Since the transcription blocker of LepRNull mice is flanked by LoxP sites , a temporal Cre expression can permanently remove this cassette . LepRNull mice were bred with animals expressing Cre-ERT2 fusion protein under the human ubiquitin C promoter sequence . Thus , tamoxifen injections were able to induce Cre recombinase activity ubiquitously , restoring LepR expression in Ubi-LepRNull mice . We decided to induce LepR reactivation when mice were 10 weeks old because the vast majority of developmental processes were completed at this age . We observed that tamoxifen injections caused no long-term changes in body weight or food intake in lean controls ( Ubi group ) and LepRNull mice ( Figure 1A\u2013D ) . In contrast , Ubi-LepRNull mice exhibited a sustained weight loss and marked food intake reduction in the first 4 weeks after tamoxifen treatment ( Figure 1A\u2013D ) . To confirm the gene reactivation , we assessed the hypothalamic expression of Lepr-b mRNA and observed the expected suppression in LepRNull mice ( 0 . 01\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00 . 00 a . u . ; n\u00a0=\u00a08 ) , compared to lean controls ( 1 . 00\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00 . 06 a . u . ; n\u00a0=\u00a08 ) . Importantly , LepR reactivation recovered the expression of Lepr-b mRNA in Ubi-LepRNull mice ( 0 . 66\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00 . 04 a . u . ; n\u00a0=\u00a08; p=0 . 071 vs . Ubi mice ) . To further validate our experimental model , we evaluated the leptin responsiveness in key hypothalamic nuclei that contain LepR-expressing neurons ( Ramos-Lobo and Donato , 2017 ) . For this purpose , we assessed the capacity of leptin to induce the phosphorylation of STAT3 ( pSTAT3 ) , which depends on the long LepR isoform ( Bates et al . , 2003 ) . As expected , an i . p . leptin injection induced a robust pSTAT3 immunoreactivity in the ventromedial subdivision of the ARH ( ARHvm ) , lateral subdivision of the ARH ( ARHl ) , dorsomedial nucleus ( DMH ) , ventromedial nucleus ( VMH ) and ventral premammillary nucleus ( PMv ) of control Ubi mice ( Figure 1E , H ) . In accordance with the deficiency of the long LepR isoform , LepRNull mice show virtually no pSTAT3 in the hypothalamus ( Figure 1F , I ) . Importantly , tamoxifen injections restored leptin responsiveness in Ubi-LepRNull mice to a similar extent as that found in the Ubi group ( Figure 1G , J , K ) . To functionally assess leptin sensitivity , we determined the acute anorexigenic effects caused by an i . p . leptin injection . Leptin induced a similar decrease of food intake and body weight in Ubi and Ubi-LepRNull mice , whereas LepRNull mice remained unresponsive to leptin ( Figure 1L ) . Altogether , these findings demonstrate that although mice were depleted from the effects of leptin until the 10th week of life , tamoxifen injections completely restored leptin signaling in adult Ubi-LepRNull mice . We found that body weight and food intake of Ubi-LepRNull mice were stabilized 6 weeks after tamoxifen treatment ( Figure 1A\u2013D ) . Therefore , all remaining analyses were performed after this period . Despite the marked weight loss induced by LepR reactivation , Ubi-LepRNull male mice remained heavier and had higher body adiposity and leptinemia , compared to control Ubi mice ( Figure 2A\u2013C ) . These changes occurred despite a complete normalization of food intake in Ubi-LepRNull mice ( Figure 2D ) . On the other hand , oxygen consumption ( VO2 ) remained significantly lower in Ubi-LepRNull male mice compared to lean controls ( Figure 2E , F ) , indicating that the increased adiposity of Ubi-LepRNull mice could be explained by a partial recovery in their energy expenditure . The respiratory exchange ratio ( RER ) of Ubi-LepRNull male mice was normalized , restoring the circadian rhythm of fuel oxidation which was absent in LepR deficient mice ( Figure 2G , H ) . As seen in the energy expenditure , the phenotype of hypoactivity observed in LepRNull mice was only partially restored in Ubi-LepRNull male animals ( Figure 2I , J ) . The energy homeostasis was also evaluated in females . As seen in males , Ubi-LepRNull females remained heavier and had higher body adiposity compared to Ubi mice ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A , B ) , although serum leptin levels and food intake were completely normalized ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C , D ) . Ubi-LepRNull females also exhibited a partial recovery in their energy expenditure in the dark phase compared to Ubi mice ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1E , F ) . Additionally , RER was normalized after LepR reactivation ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1G , H ) , whereas Ubi-LepRNull females displayed a partial recovery in their ambulatory activity , compared to Ubi mice ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1I , J ) . Food deprivation produces compensatory decreases in energy expenditure as a defense mechanism against weight loss ( Leibel et al . , 1995 ) . Thus , we subjected the animals to 24 hr fasting to evaluate their metabolic responses during a situation of negative energy balance ( Figure 3A\u2013C ) . LepRNull and Ubi-LepRNull mice showed a lower fasting-induced weight loss compared to Ubi mice ( Figure 3A ) . Notably , while Ubi mice adapted to fasting by decreasing the energy expenditure , both LepRNull and Ubi-LepRNull mice exhibited an attenuated reduction compared to baseline ( Figure 3B , C ) . Overfeeding can also produce compensatory responses in humans and mice in order to prevent excessive weight gain ( Leibel et al . , 1995 ) . We measured the food intake 4 , 12 , 24 and 48 hr after a 24 hr fasting period and observed a similar refeeding response between male and female Ubi and Ubi-LepRNull mice , whereas male LepRNull mice exhibited an increase in food intake after 24 and 48 hr of refeeding ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A , B ) . Additionally , we evaluated the metabolic responses produced by a high-fat diet ( HFD ) intake for 48 hr . Interestingly , both LepRNull and Ubi-LepRNull mice showed higher HFD intake compared to Ubi animals ( Figure 3D ) . However , HFD-induced thermogenesis was similar among the experimental groups ( Figure 3E , F ) . To investigate the possible causes of the metabolic imbalances exhibited by Ubi-LepRNull mice , we assessed the hypothalamic expression of key genes involved in energy balance regulation . As expected , LepRNull mice showed increased agouti-related protein ( Agrp ) and neuropeptide Y ( Npy ) mRNA levels in the hypothalamus , whereas the expression of proopiomelanocortin ( Pomc ) and cocaine and amphetamine regulated transcript ( Cartpt ) was reduced compared to Ubi mice ( Figure 3G ) . LepR reactivation downregulated Agrp\u00a0and Npy\u00a0mRNA levels in the hypothalamus of Ubi-LepRNull mice . However , Pomc\u00a0and Cartpt\u00a0expression was not restored and remained significantly lower compared to control Ubi mice ( Figure 3G ) . To assess whether the absence of leptin signaling in early life could have affected the viability of POMC neurons , we determined the number of \u03b1-melanocyte-stimulating hormone ( \u03b1-MSH ) or \u03b2-endorphin immunoreactive cells in the ARH ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . We observed a similar number of ARH POMC neurons between Ubi and Ubi-LepRNull mice ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . Neurons outside the ARH also regulate the thermogenic effect of leptin , including those that express the RFamide prolactin-releasing peptide ( Prlh ) in the DMH ( Dodd et al . , 2014 ) . Thus , we assessed the hypothalamic expression of Prlh mRNA , which was suppressed in LepRNull mice and remained lower in the hypothalamus of Ubi-LepRNull mice ( Figure 3G ) . Epigenetic changes in early life can cause long-term consequences in energy homeostasis and increase the risk of obesity in adulthood ( Lillycrop and Burdge , 2011 ) . Hence , the expression of some histone deacetylases ( Hdac ) was also determined and we observed that Hdac3 and Hdac5\u00a0mRNA levels were suppressed in the hypothalamus of LepRNull mice and were not normalized after LepR reactivation ( Figure 3G ) . Hdac8expression was increased in the hypothalamus of LepRNull mice , but it returned to normal values in Ubi-LepRNull mice ( Figure 3G ) . DNA methyltransferase ( Dnmt ) enzymes catalyze the transfer of a methyl group to DNA , affecting many biological functions including the energy homeostasis via hypothalamic neurons ( Kohno et al . , 2014 ) . We analyzed the expression of some Dnmt and we observed that Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b mRNA levels were suppressed in the hypothalamus of both LepRNull and Ubi-LepRNull mice , compared to Ubi animals ( Figure 3G ) . No changes among the groups were observed in the hypothalamic expression of Dnmt1 ( Figure 3G ) . Glucose homeostasis was also evaluated in our experimental animals . LepRNull mice showed the expected glucose intolerance , as well as increased insulin resistance and serum insulin concentrations ( Figure 4 ) . Glucose tolerance of Ubi-LepRNull mice was normalized in both males ( Figure 4A , B ) and females ( Figure 4F , G ) . However , Ubi-LepRNull mice remained less responsive to insulin ( Figure 4C , D , H , I ) . In accordance with their insulin resistance , serum insulin concentrations remained significantly higher in Ubi-LepRNull mice , compared to Ubi mice ( Figure 4E , J ) . Thus , absence of leptin signaling in early life produced long-term alterations in glucose homeostasis . LepR reactivation in 10-week-old mice induced a marked weight loss ( Figure 1A , C ) . Thus , it is unclear whether the alterations in the energy and glucose homeostasis of Ubi-LepRNull mice were caused by the absence of leptin in early life or were associated with the metabolic consequences of a robust weight loss ( Leibel et al . , 1995 ) . To answer this question , we produced a new group of animals in which tamoxifen treatment started at the fourth week of life ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . Therefore , LepR reactivation was induced before the onset of obesity , and consequently Ubi-LepRNull mice were not exposed to weight loss ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . Hypothalamic gene expression analysis indicated that Ubi-LepRNull mice exhibited a similar Lepr-b mRNA expression ( 1 . 26\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00 . 11 a . u . ; n\u00a0=\u00a07 ) compared to Ubi mice ( 1 . 00\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00 . 09 a . u . ; n\u00a0=\u00a08; p=0 . 5263 ) , whereas LepRNull mice showed suppressed hypothalamic Lepr-b mRNA levels ( 0 . 01\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00 . 00 a . u . ; n\u00a0=\u00a07 ) . We started the in vivo analyses at the same age of previously studied adult animals ( approximately 15 weeks of age ) . LepR reactivation before the onset of obesity did not affect the body weight of Ubi-LepRNull males in the long-term , but Ubi-LepRNull females still showed higher body weight than Ubi mice ( Figure 5A ) . Notably , both male and female Ubi-LepRNull mice exhibited increased fat deposition in the perigonadal depot ( Figure 5B ) , although no differences were observed in other fat pads ( data not shown ) or in serum leptin concentration in male mice ( Figure 5C ) . Food intake was also completely normalized in male and female Ubi-LepRNull mice ( Figure 5D ) . As seen in adult animals , LepR reactivation before the onset of obesity led to suppressed energy expenditure in the dark phase and over a 24 hr period ( Figure 5E , F ) . In contrast , RER and ambulatory activity were normalized in young Ubi-LepRNull male mice ( Figure 5G\u2013J ) . Glucose homeostasis was also evaluated in mice that received tamoxifen treatment before the onset of obesity . In contrast to the results observed after LepR reactivation in adult mice , LepR reactivation before the onset of obesity completely normalized the glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in both male and female Ubi-LepRNull mice ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . Leptin not only controls the energy and glucose homeostasis , but it also plays an important role regulating several endocrine systems ( Ahima et al . , 1996; Ramos-Lobo and Donato , 2017 ) . Thus , we also evaluated the endocrine consequences of the absence of leptin signaling in early life . We initially assessed the thyroid axis and observed that LepRNull males exhibited the expected suppression in serum T4 concentration ( Ahima et al . , 1996 ) , while Ubi-LepRNull mice showed similar values to Ubi animals ( Figure 6A ) . LepRNull mice also displayed higher serum corticosterone concentration compared to Ubi animals , whereas LepR reactivation normalized the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis ( Figure 6B ) . Next , the reproductive system was evaluated . In males , LepRNull mice showed lower serum testosterone concentration compared to Ubi animals , whereas Ubi-LepRNull mice exhibited intermediate values ( Figure 6C ) . Notably , LepR reactivation in adult animals was unable to completely restore testicle weight , which was reduced by LepR deficiency ( Figure 6D ) . To evaluate how these changes affected their fertility , Ubi and Ubi-LepRNull males were mated with wild-type females for 28 days . We observed that only 10% ( 1 out 10 ) of females mating with Ubi-LepRNull males got pregnant , whereas the percentage of pregnancy increased to approximately 50% when females mated with Ubi mice . Leptin deficiency impairs hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone ( GnRH ) release , leading to hypogonadotropic hypogonadism ( Chehab et al . , 1996; Licinio et al . , 2004 ) . Consequently , GnRH peptide content accumulates in the median eminence/mediobasal hypothalamus of food-deprived or LepR-deficient animals ( Polkowska et al . , 2006; Donato et al . , 2011 ) . We evaluated the density of GnRH fibers reaching the median eminence and observed the expected increase in the integrated optical density of GnRH staining in LepRNull mice , compared to Ubi animals ( Figure 6E , F ) . Remarkably , LepR reactivation did not restore GnRH fiber density in the hypothalamus of Ubi-LepRNull mice ( Figure 6G , H ) . GnRH release is stimulated by several neurotransmitters , including the kisspeptins ( Messager et al . , 2005 ) and nitric oxide ( Bellefontaine et al . , 2014 ) . Thus , we evaluated the hypothalamic mRNA expression of Kiss1 and Nos1 . We observed a reduction in the expression of these transcripts in the hypothalamus of LepRNull and Ubi-LepRNull mice ( Figure 6I ) , indicating that LepR reactivation in adults was not able to normalize Kiss1 and Nos1 mRNA levels . We only evaluated the testicle weight in mice that had the LepR reactivation before the onset of obesity . However , as seen in adult animals , LepR reactivation in the fourth week of life was not capable of restoring testicle weight to values found in Ubi mice ( Figure 6J ) . In females , the reproductive system was evaluated through the daily inspection of the vaginal smear . Ubi mice showed the expected variations in the estrous cycle ( Figure 6K ) . In contrast , the vaginal cytology of LepRNull mice indicated a prevalence of leukocytes and a complete absence of cornification and estrous cyclicity . LepR reactivation increased the appearance of cornified cells in the vaginal smear , although the disruption of the estrous cycle was still evident in Ubi-LepRNull mice ( Figure 6K ) . Thus , these data suggest disruption in the reproductive system of male and female mice that grew without leptin signaling until adulthood . Leptin or LepR deficiency leads to reduced brain mass ( Ahima et al . , 1999 ) , disruption of the projections from ARH neurons to the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus ( PVH ) ( Bouret et al . , 2004a; Bouret et al . , 2004b; Kamitakahara et al . , 2018 ) , as well as behavioral and cognitive problems ( Liu et al . , 2011 ) . Therefore , we evaluated the possible consequences of the lack of leptin signaling in early life on brain development . LepRNull male and female mice exhibited reduced brain mass ( Figure 7A , B ) . Notably , LepR reactivation in adult animals partially recovered brain mass , although it remained significantly lower in Ubi-LepRNull mice compared to Ubi animals ( Figure 7A , B ) . We then assessed the hypothalamic expression of several neurotrophic factors . LepRNull mice exhibited reduced mRNA levels of Bdnf , Igf1 and Dlg4 , which encode important neurotrophic factors and proteins involved in synaptic plasticity and memory formation ( Figure 7C ) . The expression of none of these transcripts was completely restored in Ubi-LepRNull mice ( Figure 7C ) . Additionally , the glial fibrillary acidic protein ( Gfap ) expression was suppressed in the hypothalamus of LepRNull and Ubi-LepRNull mice in comparison with Ubi animals ( Figure 7C ) . The brain mass was also determined in mice that recovered LepR expression before the onset of obesity . While Ubi-LepRNull males still exhibited reduced brain mass compared to Ubi mice ( Figure 7D ) , no significant difference was observed between Ubi and Ubi-LepRNull females ( Figure 7E ) . To determine whether the aforementioned alterations in Ubi-LepRNull mice could lead to behavioral or cognitive deficits , male mice were subjected to behavioral tests . In the open field , we observed that LepRNull mice showed reduced exploration , whereas LepR reactivation normalized this behavior ( Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1A ) . Next , spatial learning and memory were analyzed in the Barnes maze . In this case , LepRNull mice were not evaluated due to their decreased voluntary ambulatory activity . Along the training period , Ubi and Ubi-LepRNull mice reduced the primary latency ( Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1B; p<0 . 0001 ) and the number of primary errors ( Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1C; p<0 . 0001 ) to reach the escape box , indicating that both groups learned the task . During the test sessions , Ubi and Ubi-LepRNull mice also showed similar learning capacity since the time spent in the target zone were similar between the groups 24 hr ( Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1D , E ) and 1 week ( Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1F , G ) after the training period . Previous studies have shown that there is a critical neonatal period , in which leptin plays a neurotrophic role inducing the development of neural projections from ARH neurons to post-synaptic targets , including the PVH ( Bouret et al . , 2004b; Kamitakahara et al . , 2018 ) . To initially investigate the projections of ARH neurons to the PVH , we crossed Lepob/+ mice with LepR-Cre::LSL-tdTomato mice , in order to produce leptin deficient mice expressing the tdTomato fluorescent protein only in LepR cells . Thus , we compared the distribution of axons in the PVH between control ( LepR-Cre::LSL-tdTomato ) and Lepob/ob::LepR-Cre::LSL-tdTomato mice . We found a significant reduction in the density of axons from LepR-expressing neurons in the PVH of Lepob/ob mice compared to control animals ( Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . This result indicates that the absence of leptin signaling reduces the density of axons from LepR-expressing neurons that innervate the PVH . Next , we evaluated the density of AgRP and POMC fibers in the PVH to determine whether LepR reactivation in adults can restore these neural projections . We confirmed that LepRNull mice had reduced density of AgRP and POMC fibers in the PVH , compared to Ubi mice ( Figure 7F\u2013M ) . However , in contrast to the findings of previous studies ( Bouret et al . , 2004b; Kamitakahara et al . , 2018 ) , our results indicate that restoration of leptin signaling in adults recovers the density of AgRP and POMC fibers in the PVH ( Figure 7F\u2013M ) . \n Our findings revealed that the absence of leptin signaling in early life led to permanent changes in energy homeostasis , melanocortin system , reproduction and brain development . The metabolic dysfunctions caused by the lack of leptin signaling during development possibly involved changes in neural populations that regulate the energy expenditure , such as POMC or Prlh neurons in the hypothalamus , as well as epigenetic mechanisms since the hypothalamic expression of several enzymes that modulate DNA methylation or histone acetylation were affected in Ubi-LepRNull mice . Although the complete absence of leptin signaling is rarely found in humans , both undernutrition and overnutrition are able to produce significant changes in serum leptin concentrations , leptin sensitivity or in the development of neurocircuits that regulate energy homeostasis ( Samuelsson et al . , 2008; Chen et al . , 2009; Vogt et al . , 2014; Ralevski and Horvath , 2015 ) . Therefore , intrauterine or early postnatal changes in energy balance have been consistently linked with obesity and other metabolic diseases in adulthood ( Vickers et al . , 2005; Attig et al . , 2008; Lillycrop and Burdge , 2011; Bumaschny et al . , 2012; Chhabra et al . , 2016 ) . Thus , our findings contribute to the understanding of the metabolic programming by indicating which specific metabolic , neuroendocrine and developmental consequences arise from the absence of leptin signaling in early life , especially in the context of the alarming growth of childhood obesity worldwide ( Cunningham et al . , 2014 ) . \n Experiments were performed in male and female mice . To induce reactivation of the Lepr gene , a Lox-flanked transcription-blocking cassette ( loxTB ) was inserted in the Lepr gene to generate mice null for the Lepr ( STOCK Leprtm1Jke/J , The Jackson Laboratory ) . They were bred with animals expressing Cre-ERT2 fusion protein under the human ubiquitin C promoter sequence ( B6 . Cg-Ndor1Tg ( UBC-cre/ERT2 ) 1Ejb/2J , The Jackson Laboratory ) . As control animals , we used obese mice homozygous for the loxTB allele ( LepRNull group ) and lean control mice carrying only the Cre allele ( Ubi group ) . Mice carrying both the Cre transgene and the loxTB allele in homozygosity were considered the conditional knockout mice ( Ubi-LepRNull group ) . Mice in these strains were in the C57BL/6 background and all groups were composed of littermate animals . To visualize LepR-expressing cells , we generated a LepR-reporter mouse by breeding the LepR-Cre mouse ( B6 . 129-Leprtm2 ( cre ) Rck/J , The Jackson Laboratory ) with the lox-stop-lox ( LSL ) -tdTomato reporter mouse ( B6;129S6-Gt ( ROSA ) 26Sortm9 ( CAG-tdTomato ) Hze/J , The Jackson Laboratory ) . Thus , axons from LepR-expressing cells were visualized without additional staining by the presence of the tdTomato fluorescent protein . We then crossed Lepob/+ mice ( B6 . Cg-Lepob/J , The Jackson Laboratory ) with LepR-Cre::LSL-tdTomato mice , in order to produce leptin deficient mice expressing the tdTomato fluorescent protein only in LepR cells . Mice were weaned at 3\u20134 weeks of age and their mutations were confirmed by genotyping the DNA that had been previously extracted from the tail tip ( REDExtract-N-Amp Tissue PCR Kit , Sigma ) . The genetically modified mouse models were produced and maintained in standard conditions of light ( 12 hr light/dark cycle ) and temperature ( 22 \u00b1 1\u00b0C ) . Unless otherwise indicated , mice received a regular rodent low-fat chow diet ( 2 . 99 kcal/g; 9 . 4% calories from fat ) . All experiments were carried out in compliance with NIH guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals and were previously approved by our Institutional Animal Ethics Committee ( protocol number 137/2013 ) . All mice received 5 i . p . injections of tamoxifen ( 0 . 15 mg/g , Sigma-Aldrich ) , diluted in sesame oil ( Sigma-Aldrich ) , in alternate days . Mice were treated with tamoxifen at 10 weeks of age ( adults; LepRNull and Ubi-LepRNull mice were already obese ) or at 4 weeks of age ( young; before the onset of obesity ) . The animals were monitored until stabilization of body weight and food intake . After the stabilization period , the in vivo experiments were carried out . At least 6 weeks after the last tamoxifen injection ( 16 weeks of age in adults or 15 weeks of age for young mice ) , mice were single housed . Their body weight and food intake were measured for 3 to 4 alternate days . Then , mice were subjected to a glucose tolerance test ( 2 g glucose/kg b . w . ; i . p . ) and to an insulin tolerance test ( 1 IU insulin/kg b . w . ; i . p . ) . To determine O2 consumption ( energy expenditure ) , CO2 production , respiratory exchange ratio ( RER ) and locomotor activity ( through infrared beam sensors ) mice were placed in the Oxymax/Comprehensive Lab Animal Monitoring System ( CLAMS; Columbus Instruments , Columbus , OH ) . After an adaptation period of 3 days inside the CLAMS , these metabolic parameters were evaluated for four consecutive days . Therefore , the results presented are the average of this period . Body adiposity was determined by weighting perigonadal ( PG ) , subcutaneous ( SC ) and retroperitoneal ( RP ) fat pads in males . For the females , the periovarian ( Ov ) fat pad was also included . To visualize leptin responsive cells in the brain , adult mice ( n\u00a0=\u00a03\u20134/group ) received an acute i . p . injection of mouse recombinant leptin ( 5 \u00b5g/g , from Dr . A . F . Parlow , National Hormone and Peptide Program \u2013 NHPP , National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases ) and were perfused 90 min later . For the perfusions , mice were deeply anesthetized with isoflurane and perfused transcardially with saline , followed by a 10% buffered formalin solution ( 150\u2013200 mL per mouse ) . Brains were collected and post-fixed in the same fixative for 60 min and cryoprotected overnight at 4\u00b0C in 0 . 1 M PBS containing 20% sucrose , pH 7 . 4 . Brains were cut ( 30 \u00b5m thick sections ) in the frontal plane using a freezing microtome . To label pSTAT3 , brain sections were rinsed in 0 . 02 M potassium PBS , pH 7 . 4 ( KPBS ) , followed by pretreatment in an alkaline ( pH\u00a0>13 ) water solution containing 1% hydrogen peroxide and 1% sodium hydroxide for 20 min . After rinsing in KPBS , sections were incubated in 0 . 3% glycine and 0 . 03% lauryl sulfate for 10 min each . Next , sections were blocked in 3% normal donkey serum for 1 hr , followed by incubation in anti-pSTAT3Tyr705 primary antibody ( 1:1000; Cell Signaling; #9131 ) for 40 hr . AgRP , \u03b2-endorphin , \u03b1-MSH or GnRH immunoreactivity was evaluated in brain sections that were rinsed in KPBS and blocked in 3% normal donkey serum for 1 hr , followed incubation in anti-AgRP ( 1:2000 , Phoenix Pharmaceuticals; #H-003\u201353 ) , anti-\u03b2-endorphin ( 1:2000 , Phoenix Pharmaceuticals; #H-022\u201333 ) , anti-\u03b1MSH ( 1:2000 , Chemicon; #AB5087 ) or anti-GnRH ( 1:2000 , Immunostar; #AB_572248 ) primary antibodies . For the immunofluorescence reaction , sections were rinsed in KPBS and incubated for 90 min in AlexaFluor488 or AlexaFluor594-conjugated secondary antibodies ( 1:500 , Jackson Laboratories ) . Sections were mounted onto gelatin-coated slides and the slides were coverslipped with Fluoromount G ( Electron Microscopic Sciences , Hatfield , PA ) . For the immunoperoxidase staining , sections were incubated for 1 hr in biotin-conjugated secondary antibody ( 1:1000 , Jackson Laboratories ) and followed by 1 hr incubation with an avidin-biotin complex ( 1:500 , Vector Labs ) . The peroxidase reaction was performed using 0 . 05% 3 , 3'-diaminobenzidine , 0 . 25% nickel sulfate and 0 . 03% hydrogen peroxide resulting in a black nuclear staining . The slides were coverslipped with DPX mounting medium ( Sigma , St . Louis , MO ) . Brightfield and epifluorescence photomicrographs were acquired with a Zeiss Axiocam HRc camera coupled to a Zeiss Axioimager A1 microscope ( Zeiss , Munich , Germany ) . Images were digitized using Axiovision software ( Zeiss ) . Confocal images were captured in a 1024 \u00d7 1024 pixel format using a Zeiss LSM 780 confocal laser scanning inverted microscope ( Carl Zeiss , Germany ) . Image stacks comprised eight images captured with a LD Plan-Neofluar 40x/0 . 6 Korr M27 objective ( Zeiss ) . The ImageJ Cell Counter software ( http://rsb . info . nih . gov/ij/ ) was used to manually count the number of cells in the areas of interest . Fiber density was determined by measuring the integrated optic density using ImageJ software . To assess leptin sensitivity , adult mice received an i . p . injection of either phosphate-buffered saline ( PBS ) or mouse recombinant leptin ( 2 . 5 \u00b5g/g b . w . ; from Dr . A . F . Parlow , NHPP , USA ) 3 hr before their dark phase , and their food intake and body weight were recorded for 24 hr following the injection . Both parameters after PBS injection were compared with the values after leptin administration . To investigate the response to metabolic challenges of negative or positive energy balance , previously single-housed mice were initially subjected to a 24 hr fasting protocol . During this challenge , metabolic parameters were continuously assessed in the CLAMS , and their body weight was monitored at baseline and after 24 hr of fasting . Changes in metabolic parameters during fasting were reported as percentage of the values obtained from baseline ( fed state ) . Food intake was recorded 4 , 12 , 24 and 48 hr following the fasting period . After a recovery period ( at least 1 week ) , the animals were exposed to a HFD ( 5 . 31 kcal/g , 58% calories from fat ) for 48 hr . Metabolic parameters were assessed in the CLAMS , together with their body weight and food intake ( normalized by calorie consumption ) . To investigate changes in the reproductive system , we weighted the testicles of adult and young males . To assess fertility in males , Ubi and Ubi-LepRNull adult males ( n\u00a0=\u00a05\u20136/group ) were mated with C57BL6 female mice ( two females for each male ) for 28 days and the number of pregnant females from each group was compared . In females , we monitored the estrous cycle daily for 25 days ( n\u00a0=\u00a06/group ) . The proportion of cell types in the vaginal smear was determined and the cycle phases were classified as follows: diestrus ( mostly leucocytes ) , metestrus ( mixture of leucocytes and cornified cells ) and proestrus/estrus ( mostly epithelial or cornified cells ) . Commercially available ELISA kits were used to determine the serum concentration of leptin ( Crystal Chem ) , T4 ( Calbiotech ) , testosterone ( Calbiotech ) , insulin ( Crystal Chem ) , and corticosterone ( Arbor Assays ) . Total RNA from the hypothalamus was extracted with TRIzol reagent ( Invitrogen ) . Assessment of RNA quantity and quality was performed with an Epoch Microplate Spectrophotometer ( Biotek ) . Total RNA was incubated with DNase I RNase-free ( Roche Applied Science ) . Reverse transcription was performed with 2 \u00b5g of total RNA with SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase ( Invitrogen ) and random primers p ( dN ) 6 ( Roche Applied Science ) . Real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed using the 7500TM Real-Time PCR System ( Applied Biosystems ) and Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix ( Applied Biosystems ) . Relative quantification of mRNA was calculated by 2-\u0394\u0394Ct . Data were normalized to the geometric average of Actb , Gapdh and Ppia and reported as fold changes compared to values obtained from the control group ( set at 1 . 0 ) . The list of primers is available as Figure 3\u2014source data 2 . The wet brain mass was determined in adult and young mice , both males and females . All behavioral tests were performed in male mice treated with tamoxifen at 10 weeks of age . For the open-field test , mice were placed in an open field arena ( 0 . 3 m ( w ) x 0 . 3 m ( d ) x 0 . 45 m ( h ) for 5 min and monitored by the ANY-maze software , which tracks animal\u2019s position and records the distance travelled . To investigate spatial learning/memory , we performed the Barnes maze test . The maze consists of a white circular platform ( 92 cm of diameter ) elevated 105 cm above the floor with 20 equally spaced holes ( 5 cm diameter and 7 . 5 cm between holes ) along the perimeter with a darkened escape box placed in a constant position under one of the holes at the edge of the platform . Mice are presumed to learn the location of an escape hole using extra-maze visual cues placed on the walls of the room . Mice were initially subjected to one habituation phase in the first day prior to the initial trial . This phase was performed by placing the animal in a cylindrical chamber in the middle of the maze for 10 s . Afterwards , the chamber was removed , and mice were gently guided to the escape box . Animals were allowed to remain in the escape box for 2 min and then were returned to their original cage . The acquisition phase consisted of four trials per day for four days . For each trial , mice were placed in the cylindrical chamber in the middle of the maze for 10 s and then they could explore the maze for 3 min . After trial\u2019s completion ( i . e mice either entered the escape box or remained exploring the maze for 3 min ) animals were gently guided to and remained inside the escape box for 1 min . Subsequently , mice were returned to their home cages until the next trial , with a 15 min interval between trials . Time ( primary latency ) and number of errors ( primary errors ) to reach the escape hole for the first time were recorded by a trained researcher . Errors were considered as the number of head deflections into incorrect holes of the maze and were counted by the experimenter . Test sessions were performed 24 hr and 1 week after the last trial ( days 5 and 12 , respectively ) and consisted of 90 s exploring the maze with the escape box closed . In all experimental steps , the maze was cleaned with 40% ethanol and air-dried before each trial and between mice . The platform was monitored by the ANY-maze software , which recorded the animal\u2019s position and the distance the animal moved ( total distance travelled ) . All results were expressed as mean\u00a0\u00b1s . e . m . We performed Bartlett\u2019s test of normality to evaluate for Gaussian distribution of samples . When data had normal distribution , we used one-way ANOVA and the Newman-Keuls multiple comparison post-hoc test . In cases of non-parametric data , we used Kruskal-Wallis followed by Dunn\u2019s test . In specific cases , we used the Mann-Whitney test with Bonferroni\u2019s correction . Data was analyzed using two-way ANOVA when appropriate , followed by Newman-Keuls post-hoc test . Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism software . We considered p values\u00a0<\u00a00 . 05 to be statistically significant and p<0 . 01 when Bonferroni\u2019s correction was applied .", "headings": ["Abstract", "Introduction", "Results", "Discussion", "Materials and methods"], "keywords": ["neuroscience"], "id": "elife-40970-v2"}
{"lay_summary": "Living cells need to be able to detect changes in their environment and respond accordingly . This ability involves signals from outside of the cell triggering changes to the activity inside the cell . Heterotrimeric G proteins are important for this kind of signaling in a wide range of organisms . In animals and fungi , these proteins directly work with a specific class of receptor proteins called G protein-coupled receptors ( or GPCRs for short ) . Plants also have heterotrimeric G proteins , but it remains unclear whether they similiarly work with GPCRs . Plants detect invading microbes by using receptors that are completely different from GPCRs . For example , a receptor called FLS2 from the model plant Arabidopsis senses a telltale protein produced by bacteria , and then passes the signal to another protein called BIK1 to activate the plant\u2019s defenses . Heterotrimeric G proteins are required for this process , but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown . Liang , Ding et al . now show that heterotrimeric G proteins regulate FLS2-controlled defenses by directly interacting with FLS2 and BIK1 . Heterotrimeric G proteins also enhance defenses in at least two different ways . Firstly , in the absence of an infection , heterotrimeric G proteins stabilize the BIK1 protein to ensure that it is ready to respond . Secondly , if FLS2 does detect the telltale bacterial protein , BIK1 marks one of the heterotrimeric G proteins with a phosphate group . This then allows the G protein to boost the activity of another plant enzyme that is vital for defense signaling . In the future , it will be important to work out how activation of FLS2 leads to the activation of heterotrimeric G proteins . Furthermore , heterotrimeric G proteins are likely to regulate additional plant proteins when defenses are activated , and further studies are needed to identify these proteins .", "article": "The Arabidopsis immune receptor FLS2 perceives bacterial flagellin epitope flg22 to activate defenses through the central cytoplasmic kinase BIK1 . The heterotrimeric G proteins composed of the non-canonical G\u03b1 protein XLG2 , the G\u03b2 protein AGB1 , and the G\u03b3 proteins AGG1 and AGG2 are required for FLS2-mediated immune responses through an unknown mechanism . Here we show that in the pre-activation state , XLG2 directly interacts with FLS2 and BIK1 , and it functions together with AGB1 and AGG1/2 to attenuate proteasome-mediated degradation of BIK1 , allowing optimum immune activation . Following the activation by flg22 , XLG2 dissociates from AGB1 and is phosphorylated by BIK1 in the N terminus . The phosphorylated XLG2 enhances the production of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) likely by modulating the NADPH oxidase RbohD . The study demonstrates that the G proteins are directly coupled to the FLS2 receptor complex and regulate immune signaling through both pre-activation and post-activation mechanisms . \n As an intensely studied Pattern Recognition Receptor ( PRR ) in plants , FLS2 serves as an excellent model understanding plant innate immune signaling and receptor kinases in general ( Macho and Zipfel , 2014 ) . It forms a dynamic complex with the co-receptor BAK1 and the receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase BIK1 to perceive a conserved bacterial flagellar epitope , flg22 , to activate a variety of defense responses ( Chinchilla et al . , 2007; Heese et al . , 2007; Lu et al . , 2010; Zhang et al . , 2010; Sun et al . , 2013 ) . Stability of FLS2 and BIK1 is subject to regulation by ubiquitin-proteasome system and a calcium-dependent protein kinase ( Lu et al . , 2011; Monaghan et al . , 2014 ) . We and others previously showed that BIK1 directly phosphorylates the NADPH oxidase RbohD to prime flg22-induced reactive oxygen species ( ROS; Kadota et al . , 2014; Li et al . , 2014 ) . Heterotrimeric G proteins are central for signaling in animals ( McCudden et al . , 2005; Oldham et al . , 2008 ) , which contain hundreds of G Protein-Coupled Receptors ( GPCRs ) . In the pre-activation state , the GDP-bound G\u03b1 interacts with the G\u03b2\u03b3 dimer to form a heterotrimer . Upon activation by GPCR , G\u03b1 exchanges GDP for GTP , resulting in the activation of the heterotrimer . The activated G\u03b1 and G\u03b2\u03b3 dissociate from each other to regulate downstream effectors . Plants contain canonical G\u03b1 ( encoded by GPA1 in Arabidopsis ) , G\u03b2 ( encoded by AGB1 in Arabidopsis ) , G\u03b3 proteins ( encoded by AGG1 , AGG2 ) , and a non-canonical G\u03b3 ( encoded by AGG3 in Arabidopsis ) ( Urano and Jones , 2013 ) . Plants additionally encode extra-large G proteins ( XLGs , encoded by XLG1 , XLG2 , and XLG3 in Arabidopsis ) that carry a variable N-terminal domain and a C-terminal G\u03b1 domain ( Lee and Assman , 1999; Ding et al . , 2008 ) . Recent advances indicate that the Arabidopsis XLGs are functional G\u03b1 proteins and interact with G\u03b2\u03b3 dimers to form heterotrimers ( Zhu et al . , 2009; Maruta et al . , 2015; Chakravorty et al . , 2015 ) . Heterotrimeric G proteins play important roles in a variety of biological processes in plants , including cell division ( Ullah et al . , 2001 , 2003; Chen et al . , 2003 ) , meristem maintenance ( Bommert et al . , 2013 ) , root morphogenesis ( Ding et al . , 2008 ) , seed development and germination ( Chen et al . , 2006; Pandey et al . , 2006 ) , nitrogen assimilation ( Sun et al . , 2014 ) , and response to ABA ( Wang et al . , 2001 ) , low temperature ( Ma et al . , 2015 ) , and blue light ( Warpeha et al . , 2006 ) . Accumulating evidence indicate that heterotrimeric G proteins also play an important role in plant disease resistance against diverse pathogens ( Llorente et al . , 2005; Trusov et al . , 2006; Zhu et al , 2009; Ishikawa , 2009; Cheng et al . , 2015 ) . Recent reports indicate that XLG2 , AGB1 , and AGG1/2 mediate immune responses downstream of PRRs ( Ishikawa , 2009; Zhu et al , 2009; Liu et al . , 2013; Lorek et al . , 2013; Torres et al . , 2013; Maruta et al . , 2015 ) . XLG2 was first shown to play an important role in basal resistance to P . syringae ( Zhu et al . , 2009 ) . A recent report showed that XLG2 , but not XLG1 , is required for resistance to P . syringae and flg22-induced ROS production ( Maruta et al . , 2015 ) . AGB1 and AGG1/2 , but not AGG3 , are required for resistance to P . syringae and microbial pattern-induced ROS production ( Liu et al . , 2013; Lorek et al . , 2013; Torres et al . , 2013 ) . Furthermore , epistatic analyses indicated that AGB1 acts in the same pathway as RbohD ( Torres et al . , 2013 ) . However , it is still debated whether plants possess 7 transmembrane GPCRs ( Taddese et al . , 2014; Urano and Jones , 2014 ) . One recent report suggests that GPA1 , AGG1/2 can interact with BAK1 and the chitin-binding receptor kinase CERK1 , but not FLS2 ( Aranda-Sicilia et al . , 2015 ) . However , GPA1 does not appear to play a role in flg22-induced ROS and disease resistance to P . syringae ( Liu et al . , 2013; Torres et al . , 2013 ) . How XLG2 and AGB1 regulate PRR-mediated immunity remains elusive . In this study , we report XLG2 , AGB1 , and AGG1/2 modulates flg22-triggered immunity by directly coupling to the FLS2-BIK1 receptor complex . Prior to activation by flg22 , the G proteins attenuate the proteasome-dependent degradation of BIK1 , ensuring optimum signaling competence . After flg22 stimulation , XLG2 dissociates from AGB1 , indicating a ligand-induced dissociation of G\u03b1 from G\u03b2\u03b3 . In addition , we provide evidence that activation by flg22 additionally leads to XLG2 phospohrylation by BIK1 , and this phosphorylation positively regulates RbohD-dependent ROS production . Together the study illustrates two distinct mechanisms underlying the G protein-mediated regulation of the FLS2 signaling . \n To identify additional components of the FLS2 immune pathway , we conducted a reverse genetic screen for mutants that were compromised in flg22-induced disease resistance to Pseudomonas syringae pv tomato ( Pst ) . One mutant displayed significantly reduced resistance was xlg2 ( Figure 1A ) , confirming previous report by Zhu et al . ( 2009 ) . Further characterization indicated that the mutant is compromised in flg22-induced ROS ( Figure 1B , Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1 ) , confirming results reported previously ( Maruta et al . , 2015 ) . An examination of gene expression showed that XLG2 , XLG3 , and AGB1 , but not XLG1 , were induced in response to flg22 treatment ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . This is in agreement with the recent report that XLG2/3 , but not XLG1 , are required for flg22-induced responses and disease resistance to P . syringae ( Maruta et al . , 2015 ) . A comparison of xlg2 and agb1 mutant showed that the two mutants were similarly compromised in flg22-induced ROS burst and resistance against Pst , supporting that they act together to regulate FLS2 immunity . Interestingly , xlg2 plants were more susceptible to Pst than agb1 plants in the absence of flg22 treatment ( Figure 1A ) , suggesting that XLG2 plays additional role in plant immunity independent of AGB1 . As reported previously ( Maruta et al . , 2015 ) , we found that the xlg3 mutant was similar to WT in Pst resistance and flg22-induced ROS , whereas the xlg2 xlg3 double mutant was slightly more defective in Pst resistance ( Figure 1A ) and flg22-induced ROS ( Figure 1B ) , indicating that XLG2/3 play additive roles in flg22-induced immunity . Because AGG1/2 , but not AGG3 and GPA1 , are required for flg22-induced defense responses and Pst resistance ( Liu et al . , 2013; Torres et al . , 2013 ) , these results confirmed that the heterotrimeric G proteins required for FLS2 signaling and Pst resistance include the non-canonical G\u03b1 proteins XLG2/3 , G\u03b2 protein AGB1 , and G\u03b3 proteins AGG1/2 . 10 . 7554/eLife . 13568 . 003Figure 1 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 13568 . 007 Previous yeast two-hybrid , yeast tri-hybrid and Bi-Fluorescence Complementation assays showed that XLG2/3 form heterotrimers with the G\u03b2\u03b3 dimer through AGB1 ( Zhu et al . , 2009; Maruta et al . , 2015; Chakravorty et al . , 2015 ) . Consistent with this , luciferase complementation and co-immunoprecipitation assays detected XLG2-AGB1 and XLG3-AGB1 interactions in Nicotiana Benthamiana ( Nb ) plants ( Figure 1C , Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3A ) and Arabidopsis protoplasts ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3B\u2013C ) . Both the N and C termini of XLG2 are sufficient for the interaction with AGB1 ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3C ) . Note that XLG2-FLAG and AGB1-HA used in co-IP assays retain their biological functions when introduced into agb1 protoplasts or xlg2 plants ( see below in Figures 1D and 5E ) . In the animal model , the heterotrimeric G protein is dynamically regulated upon ligand stimulation of GPCR . We tested whether flg22 treatment can similarly regulate XLG2-AGB1 interaction . As shown in Figure 1C , the flg22 treatment resulted in a great reduction in XLG2-AGB1 interaction in Nb plants , suggesting that Arabidopsis heterotrimeric G proteins are reminiscent of their animal counterparts in that the heterotrimer is dynamically regulated upon ligand activation of receptors . Because the heterotrimeric G protein mutants under investigation all display defects in flg22-induced ROS , which requires phosphorylation of the NADPH oxidase RbohD by the BIK1 kinase ( Kadota et al . , 2014; Li et al . , 2014 ) , we monitored the flg22-induced phosphorylation of RbohD in agb1 using antibodies that recognize the BIK1-specific S39 phosphorylation . Flg22-induced S39 phosphorylation was significantly reduced in agb1 mutant protoplasts , whereas complementation of the mutant protoplasts with AGB1 restored RbohD S39 phosphorylation ( Figure 1D ) . Consistent with a positive role of AGB1 in flg22-induced RbohD S39 phosphorylation , transient overexpression of AGB1 in WT protoplasts resulted in constitutive S39 phosphorylation in RbohD ( Figure 1D ) . Together these results suggest that the hetero-trimeric G proteins regulate early components of the FLS2 signaling pathway . To identify potential proteins regulated by XLG2 , we performed immunoprecipitation of XLG2-FLAG transiently expressed in protoplasts . LC-MS/MS analysis of the immune complex identified four peptides corresponding to PBL20 ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A ) , a homolog of BIK1 . In contrast , immunoprecipitation of the control protein CPR5-FLAG failed to identify any PBL20 peptides . Co-IP and luciferase complementation assays confirmed that XLG2/3 indeed interacted strongly with PBL20 ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B\u2013C ) . AGB1 also interacted with PBL20 , albeit much weaker than did XLG2 . Because PBL20 and BIK1 belong to the same family of receptor like cytoplasmic kinases ( RLCKs ) and share similar biochemical properties ( Zhang et al . , 2010 ) , we therefore tested whether BIK1 also interacts with the G proteins . Luciferase complementation assays showed that XLG2/3 strongly interacted with BIK1 but not BAK1 or CPR5 in Nb plants ( Figure 2A , Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2A ) , whereas AGB1 interacted with BIK1 at a much lower level . Similarly , FLS2 also displayed strong interactions with XLG2/3 and a weaker interaction with AGB1 ( Figure 2A , Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2A ) . The interactions were further confirmed by Co-IP assays ( Figure 2B\u2013C , Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2B ) . In the absence of flg22 treatment , XLG2/3 strongly interacted with BIK1 and FLS2 ( Figure 2B\u2013C , Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2B ) . Treatment of protoplasts with flg22 led to a much weaker interaction , indicating that flg22 induces dissociation of XLG2 from the FLS2 receptor complex . The BIK1K105E-HA mutant protein , which is defective in ATP-binding and dominantly inhibits flg22-induced signaling when expressed in protoplasts ( Zhang et al . , 2010 ) , interacted with XLG2 and XLG3 irrespective of the presence or absence of flg22 , suggesting that the activation of the BIK1 kinase is required for the dissociation . 10 . 7554/eLife . 13568 . 008Figure 2 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 13568 . 011 We next tested XLG2 domains for interactions with BIK1 and FLS2 . Luciferase complementation and Co-IP assays showed that the C terminus of XLG2 interacted strongly with BIK1 and FLS2 , whereas the N terminus of XLG2 displayed weak interactions ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3A\u2013C ) , indicating that XLG2 interacts with FLS2 and BIK1 primarily through its C terminus . Similar to the full-length XLG2 protein , the C terminus of XLG2 also dissociated from BIK1 when protoplasts were treated with flg22 ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3C ) . GST pull-down assays showed that the HIS-tagged C-terminal fragment of XLG2 strongly interacted with GST-tagged FLS2 kinase domain , but not GST alone ( Figure 2D ) , indicating that the C terminus of XLG2 directly interacts with FLS2 . Surprisingly , GST pull-down assay showed a weak interaction between XLG2 and BIK1 ( Figure 2E ) . Interestingly , phosphatase treatment of BIK1 enhanced its interaction with XLG2 ( Figure 2E ) , suggesting that XLG2 has greater affinity with non-phosphorylated BIK1 . We similarly tested interaction between AGB1 with untreated and de-phosphorylated BIK1 by GST pull-down assay . While the un-treated BIK1 is unable to interact with AGB1 , the de-phosphorylated form of BIK1 strongly interacted with AGB1 ( Figure 2F ) . Together the results show that the G proteins dynamically interact with the FLS2-BIK1 receptor complex during FLS2 signaling , and the findings are consistent with the observed defects in flg22-induced responses and RbohD phosphorylation in the G protein mutants . 10 . 7554/eLife . 13568 . 012Figure 3 .

Two independent experiments were performed with similar results . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 13568 . 015 The direct interaction of XLG2/3 with the FLS2 receptor complex prompted us to examine FLS2 , BIK1 and BAK1 proteins in the G protein mutants . To examine BIK1 accumulation , we crossed agb1 with a transgenic line carrying a BIK1-HA transgene under control of the native BIK1 promoter ( Zhang et al . , 2010 ) and identified sibling transgenic lines of either agb1 or AGB1 genotype . Immunoblot analyses showed that the BIK1-HA protein accumulated to a much lower level in agb1 compared to WT ( Figure 3A ) , indicating that AGB1 is required for BIK1 accumulation in plants . In contrast , FLS2 and BAK1 protein accumulation was not affected in agb1 , indicating a specific effect on BIK1 protein . Examination of BIK1-HA transcripts indicated that the transgene is similarly expressed in agb1 and WT plants ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A ) . To further rule out the possibility that AGB1 modulates BIK1 at transcriptional level , we transformed agb1 and WT plants with BIK1-HA transgene under the control of the 35S promoter . Again , a much lower BIK1-HA accumulation was observed in agb1 than in WT plants although the BIK1-HA transcripts accumulated to similar levels in the two lines ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B ) . Similarly , the BIK1-HA protein accumulation was greatly reduced in agg1 agg2 double mutant plants ( Figure 3B ) , indicating that AGG1/2 are also required for BIK1 accumulation . We further asked whether XLG2 and XLG3 are required for BIK1 accumulation by transiently expressing BIK1-HA in xlg2 xlg3 mutant protoplasts . Regardless of the promoter used for BIK1-HA expression , BIK1 accumulated to lower levels in the xlg2 xlg3 double mutant than in WT protoplasts ( Figure 3C ) , indicating that XLG2/3 are also required for BIK1 accumulation . The defect in protein accumulation is specific to BIK1 , as BAK1 accumulation was not affected in xlg2 xlg3 protoplasts ( Figure 3C ) . The accumulation of BIK1-HA was not affected in gpa1 mutant plants ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C ) , a result that is consistent with previous report that GPA1 is not required for flg22-induced ROS ( Liu et al . , 2013; Torres et al . , 2013 ) . BIK1 is known to be turned-over through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway ( Monaghan et al . , 2014 ) . Treatment of plants with proteasome inhibitors PS341 ( Figure 3D ) and MG132 ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2A ) restored BIK1 accumulation in agb1 mutant plants , suggesting that AGB1 regulates BIK1 stability through the proteasome pathway . We further performed in vitro\u00a0protein degradation assay to compare the rate of BIK1 degradation in total protein extracts from WT and mutant plants . The recombinant BIK1 was degraded in the WT extract , and this degradation was blocked by PS341 ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2B ) , recapitulating the proteasome-dependent degradation of BIK1 in plants . The rate of BIK1 degradation was more rapid in agb1 and xlg2 xlg3 extracts compared to that in the WT extract ( Figure 3E\u2013F ) . Because XLG2 also interacted with PBL20 , we further tested whether XLG2/3 and AGB1 similarly regulate PBL20 stability . Indeed , PBL20 was also degraded in WT extracts , and this degradation was enhanced when extracts from xlg2 xlg3 or agb1 mutants were used ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3A\u2013B ) . Together these results demonstrate that the heterotrimeric G proteins formed by XLG2/3 , AGB1 , and AGG1/2 attenuate proteasome-dependent degradation of BIK1 and PBL20 . We next tested whether the regulation of BIK1 stability contributes to the role of heterotrimeric G proteins in flg22-induced immune responses . Transient overexpression of BIK1 in xlg2 xlg3 and agb1 protoplasts largely restored the flg22-induced RbohD S39 phosphorylation ( Figure 4A ) , indicating that the heterotrimeric G proteins positively regulate RbohD phosphorylation at least in part by enhancing BIK1 stability . We next asked whether increased copy number of BIK1 could rescue flg22-induced ROS burst in agb1 mutant . Introgression of the NP::BIK1-HA transgene into agb1 by crossing significantly enhanced flg22-induced ROS production in these plants compared to agb1 plants that contained only the endogenous copy of BIK1 ( Figure 4B ) , indicating that increasing BIK1 accumulation by the transgene at least partially restored flg22-induced ROS in agb1 . Col-0 NP::BIK1-HA plants displayed higher level of ROS compared to non-transgenic WT plants ( Figure 4B ) , indicating that BIK1 protein level is rate-limiting in flg22-induced immune responses . We further tested the impact of the NP::BIK1-HA transgene on flg22-induced resistance to Pst . While the agb1 consistently supported greater amount of bacterial growth compared to WT plants following flg22 treatment , the agb1 NP::BIK1-HA plants were indistinguishable from WT ( Figure 4C ) . Col-0 NP::BIK1-HA plants supported less bacterial growth than did WT plants , further supporting the importance of BIK1 abundance in FLS2-mediated immunity . We similarly introduced the NP::BIK1-HA transgene into xlg2 xlg3 double mutant plants by transformation . The resulting transgenic lines displayed near WT ROS production ( Figure 4D ) and Pst resistance ( Figure 4E ) in response to flg22 treatment , indicating that XLG2/3 also regulate FLS2-mediated immunity by controlling BIK1 stability . 10 . 7554/eLife . 13568 . 016Figure 4 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 13568 . 017 BIK1 is postulated to phosphorylate multiple proteins , including RbohD , in PTI ( Pattern-Triggered Immunity ) signaling ( Kadota et al . , 2014; Li et al . , 2014; Macho and Zipfel , 2014 ) . An examination of XLG2\u2009N-terminal fragment expressed in protoplasts following flg22 treatment showed a prominent shift in protein migration in SDS-PAGE ( Figure 5A ) . The shift of protein mobility was sensitive to phosphatase treatment , which is indicative of flg22-induced phosphorylation in XLG2 . The flg22-induced phosphorylation similarly occurred to the N terminus of XLG3 , but not XLG1 ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1 ) , which is consistent with the notion that XLG2/3 but not XLG1 , are involved in flg22 signaling . To determine phospho-sites in XLG2 , we expressed full-length XLG2-FLAG in protoplasts . Following flg22 treatment , the XLG2-FLAG protein was affinity-purified and subject to LC-MS/MS analysis for phospho-peptides . We were able to recover 87% of total peptide sequence , among which we identified 23 phospho-peptides corresponding to at least 15 phospho-sites ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . Interestingly , all but two phospho-peptides were located in the N terminus . Strikingly , phospho-sites between amino acids 141\u2013156 accounted for nearly half of the phospho-peptides . We further tested whether these are the major phospho-sites by site-directed mutagenesis . Simultaneously substituting three to four of these residues into non-phosphorylatable alanine ( XLG2S148A , S150A , S151A; XLG2S141A , S148A , S150A , S151A ) resulted in severe reduction to complete elimination in flg22-induced band shift in XLG2\u2009N terminus ( Figure 5B ) , indicating that amino acids Ser141 , Ser148 , Ser150 and Ser151 are indeed required for overall phosphorylation of XLG2 in response to flg22 treatment . 10 . 7554/eLife . 13568 . 018Figure 5 .

To determine whether the major phospho-sites in XLG2 were also phosphorylated by BIK1 , we raised antibodies that specifically recognize phospho-S148 and phospho-S150 . Immunoblot analysis showed that S148 and S150 were indeed phosphorylated in vitro by BIK1 , but not BIK1K105E ( Figure 5D ) . We introduced WT , non-phosphorylatable ( XLG2S141A , S148A , S150A , S151A ) and phospho-mimicking ( XLG2S141D , S148D , S150D , S151D ) forms of XLG2-FLAG transgene under control of the native XLG2 promoter into xlg2 plants and analyzed flg22-induced ROS production in the resulting transgenic lines . While the xlg2 transgenic lines carrying the WT or phospho-mimicking XLG2-FLAG transgene completely restored the flg22-induced ROS to WT level , the two lines transformed with the non-phosphorylatable XLG2-FLAG transgene only partially restored the flg22-induced ROS ( Figure 5E ) . The inability of phospho-mimicking XLG2 to constitutively activate ROS suggests that the phosphorylation of XLG2 is required , but not sufficient , for optimum activation of RbohD . We further introduced WT and the non-phosphorylatable XLG2-FLAG transgene into xlg2/3 double mutants , and inoculated independent lines with Pst . While the line carrying the WT XLG2-FLAG transgene was fully restored in resistance to Pst that was indistinguishable from the WT non-transgenic plants , the two lines transformed with the non-phosphorylatable XLG-FLAG transgene were only marginally more resistant to Pst ( Figure 5F ) . These results indicated that the phosphorylation is required , but not sufficient , for full function of XLG2 . We next asked whether the phospho-site mutants affect BIK1 stability or XLG2-BIK1 interaction . When expressed in protoplasts isolated from xlg2 xlg3 plants , the phospho-site mutants allowed similar BIK1-HA accumulation compared to protoplasts expressing the WT XLG2 protein ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3 ) . These mutants also showed normal interaction with BIK1 in the absence of flg22 and normal dissociation from BIK1 in the presence of flg22 . The results suggest that the phosphorylation of these sites affected neither BIK1 stability nor interaction with BIK1 . Because XLG2 dissociates from BIK1 following activation by flg22 ( Figure 2B ) , we reasoned that XLG2 may have additional effectors . Indeed , XLG2 interacted strongly with RbohD in Arabidopsis plants ( Figure 5G ) and Nb plants ( Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 4 ) , providing an explanation that XLG2 phosphorylation regulates ROS burst independent of BIK1 stability . The XLG2-RbohD interaction was detected in the absence of flg22 treatment , indicating that the XLG2 constitutively interacts with RbohD . \n Heterotrimeric G proteins play important role in signal transduction in plants and animals . Paradoxically , plants do not possess functional GPCRs . The maize G\u03b1 protein CT2 interacts with the receptor kinase CLV1 to control shoot meristem development ( Bommert et al . , 2013 ) . GPA1 and AGG1/2 have been shown to interact with BAK1 and CERK1 in yeast two-hybrid and Bi-Fluorescence Complementation assays , although the biological significance of this remains unknown ( Aranda-Sicilia et al . , 2015 ) . We show that XLG2 directly interacts with FLS2 and BIK1 to regulate FLS2-mediated immunity . Thus , these studies collectively support that plant receptor kinases fulfil the roles of GPCRs by directly coupling to heterotrimeric G proteins . Importantly , we show that the G proteins coupled to the FLS2 receptor complex are subject to multiple regulations during FLS2 signaling . The interaction between XLG2/3 and AGB1 , which leads to the formation of XLG2/3-AGB1-AGG1/2 heterotrimers ( Maruta et al . , 2015; Chakravorty et al . , 2015 ) , is dynamically regulated by flg22 . The flg22-induced dissociation of XLG2 from AGB1 likely reflects an increase of GTP-bound form of G\u03b1 which dissociates from the G\u03b2\u03b3 dimer upon receptor activation . Secondly , the interactions of the G proteins with FLS2 and BIK1 are also dynamically regulated by flg22 . The flg22-induced dissociation of the G proteins from BIK1 coincides with the flg22-induced BIK1 phosphorylation , suggesting that the flg22-induced BIK1 phosphorylation triggers the dissociation of the G proteins . Indeed , de-phosphorylation of BIK1 strongly enhanced its interactions with both XLG2 and AGB1 in vitro . The decoupling of the G proteins from the receptor maybe necessary for the regulation of down-stream effectors . BIK1 is subject to proteasome-dependent degradation ( Monaghan et al . , 2014 ) . Our genetic analyses indicated that XLG2 , AGB1 and AGG1/2 are required for BIK1 stability in the pre-activation state . Loss of XLG2 and AGB1 leads to accelerated degradation of BIK1 , and this is blocked by the addition of proteasome inhibitors , indicating that the G proteins attenuating the proteasome-dependent degradation of BIK1 . FLS2 is also subject to proteasome-dependent degradation ( Lu et al . , 2011 ) . However , FLS2 accumulation is not affected by the agb1 mutation , indicating that the G proteins do not generally regulate proteasome-mediated protein degradation . These observations raise an interesting question as to whether the G proteins specifically impede the ubiquitination of BIK1 or loading of BIK1 to proteasome . Importantly , introduction of a transgenic copy of BIK1 largely restored flg22-triggered immune responses and disease resistance in xlg2 and agb1 mutants , demonstrating that a major function of the heterotrimeric G protein is to maintain the signaling competence of the FLS2-BIK1 complex in the pre-activation state . In addition to the ligand-induced dissociation of XLG2 from AGB1 , flg22 induces the phosphorylation of XLG2 in the N terminus . This phosphorylation is likely caused by the BIK1 family kinases , as two of the major phosphor-sites induced by flg22 are also phosphorylated by BIK1 in vitro . Non-phosphorylatable XLG2 mutants are compromised in flg22-induced ROS production and disease resistance to Pst , indicating that the phosphorylation plays a positive role . However , mutations in the phospho-sites did not affect XLG2-BIK1 interaction nor BIK1 stability , suggesting that the phosphorylated XLG2 regulates components other than BIK1 . Indeed , XLG2 constitutively interacts with RbohD , suggesting that the phosphorylated XLG2 further enhances ROS production by modulating RbohD . RbohD is known to be subject to multiple regulations including phosphorylation by CPK5 and BIK1 ( Dubiella et al . , 2013; Kadota et al . , 2014; Li et al . , 2014 ) and calcium binding to EF-hand ( Ogasawara et al . , 2008 ) . The results presented here show that RbohD is additionally regulated by a phosphorylated XLG2 , although the underlying mechanism remains unknown . The Arabidopsis heterotrimeric G proteins reported here are analogous to the animal counterpart in that , upon activation by receptors , dissociate from each other and activate downstream effectors . Unlike the animal heterotrimeric G proteins , however , the Arabidopsis heterotrimeric G proteins additionally regulate signaling competence of the FLS2-BIK1 complex prior to receptor activation . Taken together , our results highlight remarkable similarities and striking differences in heterotrimeric G protein-coupled receptor signaling in animals and plants as a result of independent evolution . \n Arabidopsis plants used in this study include WT ( Col-0 ) , xlg2 , xlg2 xlg3 ( Ding et al . , 2008 ) , xlg3 ( SALK_107656c ) , agb1-2 ( Ullah et al . , 2003 ) , gpa1-3 ( Jones et al . , 2003 ) and agg1 agg2 mutants ( Trusov et al . , 2007 ) , and NP::BIK1-HA ( Zhang et al . , 2010 ) and NP::FLAG-RbohD transgenic lines ( Li et al . , 2014 ) . Nicotiana benthamiana plants used for luciferase-complementation assay and Arabidopsis plants used for ROS burst , protoplast preparation and bacterial infection assays were grown in soil at 23\u00b0C and 70% relative humidity with 10/14\u2009hr day/night photoperiod for 4\u20135 weeks .

{"lay_summary": "The cycle of day and night sets the pace for the existence of most life on Earth . In response , many organisms have evolved internal biological clocks which are synchronized with the rhythm of light and dark . Thanks to this \u2018circadian clock\u2019 , plants and animals can predict the onset of dawn and dusk , and schedule biological processes to specific times of the day . Each cell possesses its own circadian clock , which is formed of a complex network of genes and proteins that get activated along a 24-hour cycle . This raises the question: how do these cells coordinate to create a body clock at the level of the entire organism ? In mammals , this synchronisation happens thanks to a structure in the brain , but much less is known about how this occurs in plants . This is partly because few studies exist that focus on measuring the clocks of individual plant cells . Here , Gould , Domijan et al . monitor the circadian clock of single cells in seedlings of a plant called Arabidopsis thaliana across several days and under constant environmental conditions . To do so , they use time-lapse microscopy and genetic methods to see when and where one of the clock\u2019s core genes is switched on . The results show that , at the level of the plant , Arabidopsis has two waves of clock gene expression , one that goes up and one that goes down the root . In addition , the various parts of the plant have slightly different circadian rhythms \u2013 for instance , the tip of the root has a faster clock . Robust clock rhythms are also detected in individual cells across the plant . Clocks in neighbouring cells are found to communicate with each other to keep track of time , which might be contributing to this robustness . Mathematical simulations show that , when the individual clocks interact , they generate patterns of clock activity across the plant , which explains the two waves of gene expression in the root . Plant circadian rhythms control traits that are crucial for agriculture , such as growth , yield , disease resistance and flowering time . Understanding , and ultimately controlling , the intricate cogs of these clocks may one day allow scientists to create better performing crops .", "article": "The Arabidopsis circadian clock orchestrates gene regulation across the day/night cycle . Although a multiple feedback loop circuit has been shown to generate the 24-hr rhythm , it remains unclear how robust the clock is in individual cells , or how clock timing is coordinated across the plant . Here we examine clock activity at the single cell level across Arabidopsis seedlings over several days under constant environmental conditions . Our data reveal robust single cell oscillations , albeit desynchronised . In particular , we observe two waves of clock activity; one going down , and one up the root . We also find evidence of cell-to-cell coupling of the clock , especially in the root tip . A simple model shows that cell-to-cell coupling and our measured period differences between cells can generate the observed waves . Our results reveal the spatial structure of the plant clock and suggest that unlike the centralised mammalian clock , the Arabidopsis clock has multiple coordination points . \n The circadian clock controls gene expression throughout the day and night in most organisms , from single cell photosynthetic bacteria to mammals ( Bell-Pedersen et al . , 2005; Dunlap and Loros , 2017 ) . In many cases , a core circuit that generates this rhythm has been elucidated and been shown to oscillate in single cells . In multi-cellular organisms , these single cell rhythms can be integrated to allow a coordinated response to the environment ( Bell-Pedersen et al . , 2005 ) . Mammals achieve this by driving oscillations in peripheral tissues from a central pacemaker in the brain , the suprachiasmatic nucleus ( SCN ) ( Pando et al . , 2002; Reppert and Weaver , 2002 ) . The Arabidopsis circadian clock generates a 24 hr rhythm in multiple key processes , including stomata opening , photosynthesis , and hypocotyl elongation ( Hsu and Harmer , 2014 ) . A hierarchical structure for the plant clock has recently been proposed , similar to that for the mammalian clock , where the shoot apex\u00a0clock drives the rhythms in the root ( Takahashi et al . , 2015 ) . However , there are further tissue-dependent differences that must be explained . For example , experiments using a luciferase reporter for clock activity have shown waves of clock gene expression in leaves ( Fukuda et al . , 2007; Wenden et al . , 2012 ) , as well as striped expression patterns in roots ( Fukuda et al . , 2012 ) . Beyond the coordination of plant rhythms , how robust the circadian clock is in individual cells across the plant is also unclear . Through integration of data from whole plant studies , a genetic circuit consisting of multiple coupled feedback loops has been proposed to generate the 24-hr rhythm ( Fogelmark and Troein , 2014; Pokhilko et al . , 2012 ) . Simulations of this network display stable oscillations ( Figure 1a ) , although experimental measurements of clock rhythms under constant conditions often display damped rhythms ( Figure 1b ) ( Gould et al . , 2013; Locke et al . , 2005; Locke et al . , 2006;\u00a0Salom\u00e9 and McClung , 2005 ) . The damping is characterised by the reduction in amplitude of the oscillations through time . This damping at the whole plant level could be due to the clock circuit in all individual cells damping ( top , Figure 1c ) , or to cells desynchronising due to different intrinsic periods or phases ( Guerriero et al . , 2012; Komin et al . , 2011 ) ( bottom , Figure 1c ) , or cells desynchronising due to stochasticity in clock activity ( Guerriero et al . , 2012 ) . Previous studies have attempted to measure the clock in Arabidopsis at single-cell resolution; however , these have focused on specific parts of the plant for short time series ( Takahashi et al . , 2015; Yakir et al . , 2011 ) . Here , using a reporter for the core clock gene CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED 1 ( CCA1 ) ( Wang and Tobin , 1998 ) , we examine the dynamics of the Arabidopsis clock across the whole plant at the single cell level over several days . Our results reveal that damping of rhythms at the whole plant level is mainly due to desynchronisation of oscillating single cells with different periods , and not due to noise in gene expression due to low molecule numbers or damping of individual oscillations . We observe two waves of clock gene expression , one up and one down the root . These waves , combined with more variable clock periods at each position in the root , cause the most desynchronisation . From our single cell data , we are able to estimate the coupling strength between cells , and find evidence of coupling , especially strong in the root tip . A simple model suggests that our observed period differences , plus cell-to-cell coupling , can generate the observed waves in clock gene expression . Thus , our data reveals both the structure and robustness of the plant circadian clock system . \n To analyse the dynamics of the plant clock at the single cell level , we constructed reporter lines that allowed us to quantitatively measure the nuclear level of the core clock protein CCA1 ( Wang and Tobin , 1998 ) . These reporter lines contained a CCA1-YFP protein fusion construct driven by the CCA1 promoter in a cca1-11 mutant background . They also contained a 35S::H2B-RFP nuclear marker to enable automatic detection of individual nuclei ( Federici et al . , 2012 ) . By screening the clock phenotypes of multiple reporter lines we ensured that our reporter construct was functional and rescued the period phenotype of the cca1-11 mutant ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . We took forward both a rescued wild-type period ( WT ) and a long period ( CCA1-long ) reporter line for further analysis . We carried out time-lapse movies of Arabidopsis seedlings using a custom developed time-lapse confocal microscope setup ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . In order to examine the intrinsic behaviour of the clock we first entrained the seedlings to 12:12 hr light/dark cycles before examining the clock under constant conditions ( constant blue light ( 30 \u03bcmol m\u22122 s\u22121 ) and temperature ( 22\u00b0C ) ) . Our method allowed us to track and extract fluorescence values from the same individual nuclei over several days ( Figure 1d , e ) . We first examined the average CCA1-YFP nuclear fluorescence signal from regions of the hypocotyl , cotyledon and roots ( Figure 1f , g ) . We observed a robust oscillation in the cotyledon ( red line , Figure 1g ) and hypocotyl ( blue line , Figure 1g ) , although with slight damping to the amplitude . In the top part of the root we observed strong damping of the circadian rhythm ( black line , Figure 1g ) , although the oscillations recovered somewhat in the root tip ( grey line , Figure 1g ) . Three repeat plants showed similar behaviour ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3 ) . We also observed similar behaviour in our CCA1-long reporter line ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4 ) , showing that our results remain true across a range of clock activity . To determine the underlying cause of the damping in different tissues , we examined the clock rhythm in hundreds of cells from each seedling analysed ( Figure 1h , Figure 1\u2014figure supplements 3b , 4b and 5 ) . Oscillations could be observed in all tissues , with most cells displaying circadian rhythms ( see Figure 1\u2014source datas 1 and 2 for percentage of cells scored rhythmic for each plant section ) . Analysis of single cell oscillation amplitudes during the course of the movie revealed stable oscillations , with only a slight reduction in median oscillation amplitude in the root ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 6 ) . Neither the strong damping at the tissue level in the root ( Figure 1g ) , nor the damping observed at the plant level ( Figure 1a ) , can be explained by individual cells losing rhythmicity ( Figure 1h , Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 6 ) . We then examined the synchrony between cells and robustness of these rhythms in more detail . The hypocotyl and cotyledon were the most synchronised , with the amplitude of the mean trace nearly equalling the median amplitude of the individual cell time-series ( Figure 2a , Figure 2\u2014figure supplements 1 and 2 ) . The hypocotyl and cotyledon rhythms also exhibited low period variability both within and between time traces , indicating a high level of robustness ( Figure 2b , Figure 2\u2014figure supplements 1b and 2b ) . However , the root displayed significant desynchronisation , with the amplitude of the mean trace lower than the median amplitude of the individual cell traces ( Figure 2a , Figure 2\u2014figure supplements 1a and 2a ) , with higher variability in period within and between single cell lineages ( Figure 2b and Figure 2\u2014figure supplements 1b and 2b ) . We next asked whether the damping of amplitude in the mean rhythm is caused by noise in gene expression due to low clock molecule numbers , as proposed by previous stochastic modelling ( Guerriero et al . , 2012 ) . Simulations of the stochastic model of the Arabidopsis gene network ( Guerriero et al . , 2012 ) display greater desynchronisation as the system size , effectively the simulated number of molecules in the cell , is reduced ( Figure 2c\u2013e ) . The lower the molecule number , the more desynchronisation at the single cell level , and the more damping of the mean expression ( red line , Figure 2c ) , even though the individual traces do not display a damped rhythm . To explore this further , we simulated the model for a range of system sizes ( Figure 2c ) and examined the synchrony and robustness of the simulations ( Figure 2d , e ) . Previously the system size was estimated to be on the order of 100 molecules per cell ( bottom panel , Figure 2c ) in order for the desynchronisation observed in whole plant measurements to be explained solely by noise ( Guerriero et al . , 2012 ) . We compared the level of synchrony and period variability from simulations of this model to our experimentally measured single cell rhythms . The single cell rhythms that we detect in the hypocotyl and cotyledon have a lower period variability ( Figure 2b ) than a system size of 100 and in fact behave closer to a system size of 1000 ( Figure 2e ) . The hypocotyl and cotyledon also have a smaller difference between the amplitude of the mean trace ( green line ) compared to the median amplitude of the individual cell time-series ( red line ) ( Figure 2a ) than a system size of 100 ( Figure 2d ) , and again behaves closer to a system size of 1000 ( Figure 2d ) . The level of desynchronisation observed in the root and root tip , however , behave more like a simulated system size of 100 ( Figure 2a\u2013e ) . Similar CCA1-YFP expression levels are observed across the plant ( Figure 2f , g ) , so it is unlikely that this lack of robustness is due solely to a change of total molecule number for the clock system in different parts of the plant . In fact the amplitude and expression levels of the single cell oscillations in the root tip are high compared to other sections across the plant ( Figure 2f , g and Figure 2\u2014figure supplements 1a , c\u2013d and 2a , c\u2013d ) . If the strong damping in the root is not a result of noise due to low clock molecule numbers , or individual cells losing rhythmicity , what is the cause ? The measured variable and desynchronous rhythms in the root suggest that the clock could be behaving differently in different parts of the root . To test this possibility , we plotted the period of the individual cell oscillations across the plant ( Figure 3a , b and Figure 2\u2014figure supplements 1e , f and and 2e , f ) . We observed surprising spatial structure to the clock in the root . The upper sections of the root displayed longer periods than the rest of the plant , as reported previously for the whole root ( James et al . , 2008 ) . However , we observed very fast rhythms in the root tip ( Figure 3a , b ) , which is also the section with very high expression rhythms ( Figure 2f , g ) . Although we do not observe evidence of phase resetting in the root tip , as proposed in an earlier luciferase study ( Fukuda et al . , 2012 ) , this could be due to our different growth conditions and stage of plant development . A repeat plant showed similar results ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1c\u2013f ) , as did the CCA1-long reporter line ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2c\u2013f ) . Each radial section of the plant along the longitudinal axis can be made up of multiple cell types . Therefore , we next tested whether the rhythms have any spatial structure in the z direction , which would suggest that different cell types have different period rhythms . Plots of period in the z direction in each section do not reveal any discernible pattern ( Figure 3c , d , Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3 ) . This suggests that the differences in rhythms we observe are not restricted to a specific cell type . To further understand the spatial structure of the clock , we examined montages of clock gene expression ( Figure 3e; Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1g; Videos 1\u20133 ) and timing of peaks of expression ( Figure 3f\u2013h ) across the plant . Examination of the clock phase between 48 and 72 hr reveals that the clock peaks earlier in the hypocotyl ( mean phase in upper hypocotyl 51 . 2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01 . 1h , mean phase in lower hypocotyl 52 . 1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01 . 5h ) than in the cotyledon ( mean phase 55 . 6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02 . 3h ) ( Figure 3f\u2013h ) . From the top of the root the phase of the clock is shifted to later in the day as you go down the root ( upper root mean phase 56 . 6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04 . 5h ) ( Figure 3h ) . However , from the root tip ( mean phase 56 . 2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05 . 0h ) the phase of the clock is shifted to later in the day as you go up ( lower root phase 58 . 0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04 . 4h ) . This generates two waves in the montages of clock gene expression , one going up and one going down the root ( Figure 3e; Video 1; Figure 2\u2014figure supplements 1g and 2g ) . At each y position in the root , the phases are also more variable than in the rest of the plant , with a standard deviation of phases of\u00a0\u00b15 . 0 hr in the root tip compared to\u00a0\u00b11 . 1 hr in the hypocotyl for phases occurring between 48 and 72 hr ( Figure 3h ) . Thus , the damped mean rhythm of clock activity we observed in the root ( Figure 1g ) is caused by the averaging of these two waves of gene expression that have a broad distribution of phases . We observed qualitatively similar waves in luciferase reporter lines for the clock genes PSEUDO-RESPONSE REGULATOR 9 ( Ito et al . , 2003 ) ( Figure 3i; Video 4 ) , CCA1 ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1a ) and GIGANTEA ( Park et al . , 1999 ) ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1b ) , suggesting that our results are a general property of the clock . The coherent waves of gene expression suggested that the plant clock signal could be coupled . To estimate this coupling , we calculated the order parameter ( Kuramoto , 1984 ) from our single cell data and estimated the coupling strength based on a technique developed for mammalian circadian cells ( Rougemont and Naef , 2007 ) . We observed signs of coupling across the plant , with the strongest evidence for coupling in the root tip , where the order parameter actually increased with time ( Figure 3j and Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2\u20134 ) . Interestingly , this occurred where cell density was highest , as observed in cultured SCN cells ( Aton et al . , 2005 ) . To investigate the mechanism for the waves of clock gene expression in the root we developed a simple mathematical model where the cells are described by coupled oscillators with different periods , as informed by the data ( Figure 3k ) . The periods of the clock in the model were faster in the shoot and root tip than the rest of the root , as measured experimentally . This simple model can generate waves of gene expression up and down the root that produce a bow wave in the space-time plot ( Figure 3k ) , similar to that observed experimentally ( Figure 3h , i ) . \n Our single cell measurements have revealed tissue specific differences in the phases and robustness of the clock in Arabidopsis . These differences are not restricted to one cell type , as similar periods are observed in the z dimension through the plant ( Figure 3c , d ) , suggesting that cells are instead responding to information based on their longitudinal position . The observed robust rhythms in the hypocotyl that peak before the cotyledon and the top of the root , with a wave of clock gene expression down the root , fit with a proposed hierarchical structure for the plant clock , where the shoot\u00a0apex clock drives the rhythms in the root ( Takahashi et al . , 2015 ) . However , our results suggest that the structure of the plant clock is more complicated , as this hierarchical model does not explain the observed short period oscillations in the root tip , or the wave of clock gene expression up from the root tip . Our results support a more decentralised model of clock coordination in plants ( Endo , 2016; Endo et al . , 2014 ) . Earlier studies of the Arabidopsis clock argue either that cellular oscillations are uncoupled ( Thain et al . , 2000; Yakir et al . , 2011 ) , or weakly , but detectably , coupled ( Fukuda et al . , 2007; Fukuda et al . , 2012; James et al . , 2008; Takahashi et al . , 2015; Wenden et al . , 2012 ) . Coupling has also been detected in Lemna gibba fronds , as examination of a clock bioluminescence reporter with single cell resolution showed weak coupling between individual clock oscillators under constant conditions ( Muranaka and Oyama , 2016 ) . These heterogeneous oscillations could be synchronised by light-dark cycles ( Okada et al . , 2017 ) . Our single cell approach is consistent with weak coupling across the whole plant but reveals regions with strong local coupling between cells , especially in the root tip , which is sufficient to drive an increase in synchrony with time . In the future , it will be interesting to examine whether the shoot apical meristem , which has a high cell density like the root tip\u00a0and has been shown to be coupled when excised from the plant , has a similarly high coupling strength given its role in driving rhythms in the shoot ( Takahashi et al . , 2015 ) . Our modelling reveals that cell-cell coupling together with the observed period differences between tissues is sufficient to replicate the decentralised spatial structure of the clock that we observe experimentally . Our simple model offers a qualitative match to data . In the future it will be interesting to develop more mechanistic models of the plant circadian clock at the single cell level , as has been done at the bulk level previously ( Fogelmark and Troein , 2014; Guerriero et al . , 2012; Locke et al . , 2005; Locke et al . , 2006; Pokhilko et al . , 2012 ) . One barrier to achieving this is that currently our estimations of clock periods from single cells are from the intact plant , and so will include the effects of cell-cell coupling . To develop mechanistic models at the single cell-level , it will be critical to develop reliable methods to measure the rhythmic properties of physiologically representative plant cells in physical isolation . It will also be important to test future models by examining the clock experimentally under a range of environmental conditions and at different developmental stages . Decentralised coordination could create flexibility and allow parts of the plant to respond differentially to environmental perturbations . There is already evidence that the root clock may respond differently to light than the shoot ( Bordage et al . , 2016; Nimmo , 2018 ) , and that the vasculature and epidermal clock regulate distinct physiological processes ( Shimizu et al . , 2015 ) . It has been recently shown that initiation of lateral roots triggers the resetting of the clock in the emerging lateral root ( Vo\u00df et al . , 2015 ) . In the case of lateral roots , auxin is proposed to be involved in resetting the clock ( Vo\u00df et al . , 2015 ) . Waves of auxin also occur in the root ( Moreno-Risueno et al . , 2010 ) , and it will be interesting to examine if the circadian clock wave is linked to these auxin dynamics . An important next step will be to investigate what the coupling signal is for the plant circadian clock ( Covington and Harmer , 2007; Dalchau et al . , 2011; Haydon et al . , 2013 ) . \n The CCA1::CCA1-YFP was constructed as follows: The coding region of CCA1 was amplified from Arabidopsis ( Ws ) genomic DNA using the primer pair CCA1_CDS_Fwd ( 5\u2019-AAAGGATCCATGGAGACAAATTCGTCTGGA-3\u2019 ) and CCA1_CDS_Rev ( 5\u2019-ATACCCGGGTGTGGAAGCTTGAGTTTCCAA-3\u2019 ) . The CCA1 promoter region was amplified from Arabidopsis ( Ws ) genomic DNA using the primer pair CCA1_prom_Fwd ( 5\u2019-AAAGAATTCATTTAGTCTTCTACCCTTCATGC-3\u2019 ) and the CCA1_prom_Rev ( 5\u2019-ATAGGATCCCACTAAGCTCCTCTACACAACTTC-3\u2019 ) . Unique restriction sites were designed at the ends of the amplicons to facilitate cloning . The fragment of CCA1 coding region was cloned in the modified pPCV812 binary plasmid ( Pfeiffer et al . , 2009 ) between the 35S promoter and the YFP gene via BamHI ( 5\u2019 ) and SmaI ( 3\u2019 ) sites , resulting in 35S::CCA1-YFP . Next , the 35S promoter was replaced by the CCA1 promoter fragment via EcoRI ( 5\u2019 ) and BamHI ( 3\u2019 ) sites , resulting in CCA1::CCA1-YFP . The cloned CCA1 promoter fragment was 862 bp in length and contained the full 5\u2019 -untranslated region , but not the ATG . The 35S::H2B-RFP construct was described previously in ( Federici et al . , 2012 ) . The PRR9:LUC , CCA1:LUC and GI:LUC reporters are in the Col-0 background and were also described previously ( Pal\u00e1gyi et al . , 2010 ) . The CCA1::CCA1-YFP construct was transformed in cca1-11 ( Ws ) mutant background ( Hall , 2003 ) . Homozygous T3 generations of several independent transgenic lines were checked for complementation via delayed fluorescence ( Gould et al . , 2009 ) ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1b , c ) . The CCA1::CCA1-YFP expressing line showing full complementation was then re-transformed with 35S::H2B-RFP which was used for tracking purposes during analysis ( Federici et al . , 2012 ) . Arabidopsis seeds were surface sterilised and suspended in 0 . 1% top agar and placed in 4\u00b0C for 2 days . After sowing , seeds were grown inside of growth incubators ( Sanyo MLR-352 ) under 12:12 LD cycles in 80 umol m2 s\u22121 cool white light at 22\u00b0C for entrainment . Henceforth , these conditions are referred to as entrainment conditions . 10-20 seeds were sown onto Murashige and Skoog ( MS ) 2% agar in clear 96-well microtitre plates with at least 8 wells per line . A second clear microtitre plate was placed on top of the plate containing the seed to increase well height . These were then sealed using porous tape ( Micropore ) . Seedlings were grown for 9 days under entrainment conditions and transferred to experimental conditions on dawn of the 10th day . For luciferase experiments , on the 9th day seedlings were sprayed with a 5 mM luciferin solution in 0 . 001% Triton x-100 before transfer to experimental conditions on dawn of the 10th day . Imaging was carried out in Sanyo temperature controlled cabinets ( MIR-553 or MIR-154 ) at 22\u00b0C and under an equal mix of red and blue LEDs ( 40 \u03bcmol m\u22122 sec\u22121 total ) . Seedlings were imaged using an ORCA-II-BT ( Hamamatsu Photonics , Japan ) or LUMO CCD camera ( QImaging , Canada ) . Experiments were run over several days with images being taken every hour as described previously ( Gould et al . , 2013; Litthauer et al . , 2015 ) Image analysis was carried out using Imaris ( Bitplane , Switzerland ) or ImageJ ( NIH , USA ) . Seedlings were sown in a row of eight seedlings on 2% agar media supplemented with MS media . Seedlings were grown upright for four days under entrainment conditions . Imaging commenced on dawn of the fifth day . Imaging was performed inside of Sanyo plant growth incubators at 22\u00b0C under an equal mix of red and blue light emitting diodes ( 40 \u03bcmol m\u22122 sec\u22121 total ) ( Figure 3i , Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1a ) or under blue light emitting diodes ( 40 \u03bcmol m\u22122 sec\u22121 total ) ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1b ) . Seedlings were imaged upright using a LUMO CCD camera ( QImaging , Canada ) . Experiments were run over several days with images being taken every 90 min . For confocal experiments seed were sown directly onto glass bottom dishes ( Greiner , Austria ) in an array format . Once dry , the seeds were covered with 5 ml MS 2% agar media in absence of sucrose . Once set , dishes were sealed with porous tape ( Micropore ) and grown upright under entrainment conditions for 4 days . After 4 days plates were ready for imaging . The microscopy pipeline is outlined in Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2 . Up to 18 seedlings were grown in an array format on glass bottom dishes . At dawn on the fourth day of growth the dishes were fixed into the confocal temperature controlled stage ( 22\u00b0C ) using the dish manifold . To maintain correct light conditions ( 30 \u03bcmol m\u22122 s\u22122 constant blue light ) a custom-made light emitting diode ( LED ) rig was used . Growth conditions allowed slow growth during the movie , which enabled easier tracking of single cells . A Zeiss 710 ( Zeiss , Germany ) inverted confocal microscope with a 40x/1 . 2 water corrected oil objective was used for all imaging . YFP and RFP excitation was produced using a 514 nm laser and a main beamsplitter ( MBS ) 458/514 . The 514nm laser was set to 4% power for all experiments . To reduce problems with auto-fluorescence and improve signal to noise ratio a lambda scan was carried using a ChS PMT and filters 492-658 . Brightfield ( BF ) used a ChD PMT . Imaging was carried out using a 0 . 6 zoom to increase field of view . A motorised stage was used to allow multiple positions to be imaged across the plant per experimental run . The diameter of nuclei in our seedlings ranges in size from 6 \u03bcm ( root tip ) to 15 \u03bcm ( hypocotyl ) . A resolution of 2 \u03bcm in the z dimension was chosen to allow the capture of several slices through each nucleus . Data were auto saved during imaging with data split into files by position imaged . Firstly blank images created by time-lapse being terminated early were removed in ImageJ . Also with ImageJ , lambda scans produced during confocal imaging were split into YFP ( 511 to 547 nm ) , RFP ( 586 to 625 nm ) and brightfield ( BF ) spectrums and then reduced in dimensionality to give one channel for each wavelength . Data were then saved as OME TIFF , writing each time point as a separate file . Once processed , all the data were loaded into Imaris ( Bitplane , Switzerland ) and merged to produce one file containing YFP , RFP and BF . A median filter size 3x3x1 was then applied across all of the data . Detection of YFP/RFP expressing cells was carried out using the spot detection feature and tracking of spots over time was carried out using an autoregressive motion model using an estimated cell x , y diameter of 6-10 \u03bcm . Data were then exported in excel format for further analysis . Details\u00a0are provided in the subsequent section . Quality control checks were carried out at multiple points ( see Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2 ) . The first quality check was made to ensure that the seedling remained in the focal plane during the course of the experiment . If not , the dataset was not carried forward for further analysis . The second check was to make sure that no mistakes were made in the processing of the images ( described above ) . This was carried out by examining the data in Imaris and ensuring that RFP signal was detected throughout the movie . The third check was carried out to correct any errors in tracking cells across the time-lapse data . The fourth check used the videos to more closely monitor the data for anything that looked problematic . The final check used the graphs to identify any problems that may have occurred during the whole single cell pipeline . If the laser power was not found to be stable during the course of the imaging , which could be observed by fluctuations in the background fluorescence , the dataset was not carried forward for further analysis . Period analysis was carried out in BioDare , an online system for data sharing and analysis ( Costa et al . , 2013; Moore et al . , 2014 ) . Since most of the period analysis methods in BioDare require evenly spaced time series , the data were first interpolated ( using MATLAB\u2019s ( MathWorks , U . K . ) interp1 function and spacing of 1 hr ) . Period estimates were obtained by three different methods: Spectrum Resampling ( Costa et al . , 2013 ) , FFT-NLLS ( Johnson and Frasier , 1985; Straume et al . , 2002 ) and mFourFit ( Edwards et al . , 2010 ) . Cells were classed as rhythmic only if each method identified them as rhythmic ( i . e . BioDare did not ask to ignore them ) , their goodness of fit was below one for FFT-NLLS and mFourfit or 0 . 9 for Spectrum Resampling and all estimates obtained by different methods were within 2 . 5 hr of each other . In Figure 3 , Figure 2\u2014figure supplements 1 and 2 , the FFT-NLLS period estimates are shown . Period variability within and between cells was calculated as described previously ( Kellogg and Tay , 2015 ) . Since some of the sections imaged overlap ( e . g . Figure 2f; Figure 3a; Figure 2\u2014figure supplements 1c and 2c ) , in order to not count cells multiple times , some of the cells were removed . This was done in the following manner: if there was an area of overlap in multiple sections , only cells belonging to the sections with lower x and y positions were kept , for\u00a0example in Figure 3a , any cells in the upper hypocotyl section that also belong spatially to the lower hypocotyl section , were removed from subsequent analysis . In the repeat WT experiment , the root tip section imaged encompasses a longer section of the root ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1c ) . Hence , in order to make the analysis comparable to WT ( Figure 3 ) , we split the root tip section for further analysis . We considered the root tip cells of the repeat to be only those less than 0 . 18 mm from the actual tip , while the rest of them were classed as \u2018Root up from tip\u2019 ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1a , b ) . In the case of analysis at tissue level , where multiple sections had to be pooled for analysis ( e . g . Figure 1g , h and Figure 1\u2014figure supplements 3 , 4 and 5 ) , since different sections were imaged at different times , before any further statistics were done , all the data were interpolated at the times where measurements across any section were made . For analysis of amplitudes , peak and trough times for the individual cells ( Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 6; Figure 2a , f , g;Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1a , e , f; Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2a , e , f ) were identified using the findpeaks function in MATLAB . This was done on linearly detrended data . In case of the WT data ( Figure 2 ) , since the data are sampled more frequently ( every 1 . 1 vs . 3 hr in WT repeat and CCA1-long line ) , the data are noisier , hence a smoothing filter ( robust local regression using weighted linear least squares and a Second degree polynomial model ) was also applied after linear detrending . Amplitudes of traces were calculated as a mean of all troughs to peak and peak to trough amplitudes . For amplitude calculations , only rhythmic cells that had at least three peaks detected during the movie were analysed . Also , if the number of peaks and troughs identified by the analysis differed by more than one the cell was discarded from the analysis . To facilitate analysis , individual seedlings were manually cropped into individual time stacks using ImageJ . From these image stacks a rectangular region of interest ( ROI ) containing the full length of the root and as much length of the hypocotyl as possible , whilst still excluding the cotyledons , was defined . Custom developed MATLAB scripts were used to extract luminescence data for each pixel in the ROI , giving time series for each pixel . After inspection of the images and the time series , some features were identified and the following measures applied to address them: To visualise spatial patterns across the length of the root , space-time plots of the root luminescence were created ( Figure 3i , Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1 ) . To do this , we take the maximum signal intensity across one pixel wide longitudinal sections of the root for each image and assign this value to position m , n of the space time plot , where m is the image number and n the longitudinal section . The space-time plots presented include 10 pixels of the hypocotyl . The mean luminescence is normalised so that the peak expression of each longitudinal section ( n ) is 1 . In Figure 1a , we simulate an existing deterministic model of the clock ( Pokhilko et al . , 2012 ) . The model was run for 168 hr from introduction into constant light conditions and LHY/CCA1 mRNA is reported ( in the model CCA1 and LHY are treated as a single component [Pokhilko et al . , 2012] ) . In Figure 2 , we simulated a stochastic model of an existing circadian clock model ( Guerriero et al . , 2012; Pokhilko et al . , 2012 ) . In Guerriero et al , the model is scaled by the parameter \u03a9 , so that a molecule count close to \u03a9 is obtained . For detailed description of the scaling , the reader can refer to this paper . Comparison of the model simulated for different \u03a9 values to the previously published data indicates that the model molecule count of a few hundred cells ( i . e . \u03a9 ) is a good prediction of the actual molecule count ( Guerriero et al . , 2012 ) . Here , we have taken the same circadian clock model and simulated it for various values of \u03a9 . Model equations scaled for the \u03a9 factor are given in ( Guerriero et al . , 2012 ) . The model was simulated for 200 hr from introduction into constant light conditions and 100 simulation runs ( proxy for 100 cells ) were performed . The stochastic simulations were performed using the Gillespie algorithm ( Gillespie , 1977 ) . For each simulation , further analysis of amplitudes and period was done after the simulated data were interpolated at 2 hr intervals and then only for the simulated data from 28 hr to 168 hr in LL , in order to be closely comparable to the time interval of the original single cell data ( Figure 1d ) . The Gillespie algorithm was written in MATLAB and the amplitudes and periods of the simulations were extracted using the MATLAB findpeaks function . Periods were calculated as a mean difference of peak-to-peak intervals . Amplitudes were calculated as a mean of all trough to peak and peak to trough amplitudes . For a set of individual cells , the inter-cellular synchrony was analysed . First , one cell was selected as a centroid of the synchronisation analysis . Then , its neighbouring cells , defined as those located within its sphere ( radius r ) , were extracted . From CCA1-YFP expression signal , phase of the j-th neighbouring cell ( j\u00a0=\u00a01 , 2 . . , N ) was computed as ( Pikovsky et al . , 2001 ) \u03b8j ( t ) =2\u03c0\u00a0k+t-tktk+1-tk\u00d72\u03c0 . Here , the k-th peak time tk of the bioluminescence signal was detected by a cosine fitting method ( coefficient of determination larger than 0 . 7 ) using the estimated period \u03c4i . Then for each time point , the order parameter R ( t ) ( Kuramoto , 1984 ) was obtained asR ( t ) e\u0398=1N\u2211j=1Ne\u2212i\u03b8j ( t ) The order parameter ( 0\u00a0<\u00a0R\u00a0<\u00a01 ) becomes unity for completely synchronised cells ( \u03b81=\u03b82= . . =\u03b8N ) , whereas it becomes zero for non-synchronised cells . Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2 shows the results of synchronisation analysis for root tip ( a ) , lower root ( b ) , upper root ( c ) , lower hypocotyl ( d ) , upper hypocotyl ( e ) , and cotyledon ( f ) . For each section , a total of n curves were drawn by selecting individual cells as the centroids ( root tip , n\u00a0=\u00a0242; lower root , n\u00a0=\u00a084; upper root , n\u00a0=\u00a046; lower hypocotyl , n\u00a0=\u00a0114; upper hypocotyl , n\u00a0=\u00a053; cotyledon , n\u00a0=\u00a0103 ) . By linear regression analysis of each curve , the slope of the order parameter against time was computed , where a positive slope implies that the level of synchrony increases in time due to cell-to-cell interactions . Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2h shows the dependence of the slope value on cell density ( \u03c1=N/ ( 4/3 ) \u03c0r3 ) . Positive slopes are mostly found in the root tip ( Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2g ) , with a high correlation to the cell density . Next , the coupling strength was estimated for each synchronisation curve {R ( t ) } . Our approach is based upon a simplified version of the technique developed for weakly interacting mammalian circadian cells ( Rougemont and Naef , 2007 ) . As a model for the neighbouring cells , we consider a set of coupled phase oscillatorsd\u03b8jdt=\u03c9j+KN\u2211k=1Nsin\u2061 ( \u03b8k\u2212\u03b8j ) Assuming that the period \u03c4j estimated from the j-th cellular trace is not strongly affected by the other cells ( Rougemont and Naef , 2007 ) , the natural angular frequency was set as \u03c9j=2\u03c0/\u03c4j for each oscillator . Given an initial condition \u03b8j ( 0 ) extracted from the cellular traces , the phase oscillator model was simulated ( Euler method with time step 0 . 1 hr ) . Accordingly , the time evolution of the order parameter R ( t ) could be obtained . The coupling strength , which was initially set as K\u00a0=\u00a00 . 002 , is constant for each simulation . Staring from the minimum level of coupling , the coupling strength was slowly increased so that the phase oscillators are eventually mutually synchronised and the corresponding slope value increases monotonously . At the point when the slope value exceeds the one obtained from the experiment , the corresponding value of K provides the coupling estimate for the experimental data . Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2i shows the results . Stronger coupling was estimated for densely populated areas , implying that the cell-to-cell interactions are strengthened when cells are closely located to each other . To examine the dependence of the present analysis on the synchrony measure used , the synchronisation index ( Garcia-Ojalvo , Elowitz , Strogatz , 2004 ) was utilized in place of the order parameter . The synchronisation index has the advantage that the noise-sensitive procedure of phase extraction from the cellular traces is not required , since it can be computed directly from the measured signals . For N cellular traces {xj ( t ) : j\u00a0=\u00a01 , 2 , . . , N} , the averaged signal M ( t ) = ( 1/N ) \u03a3 j xj ( t ) is computed . Then the synchronisation index is given byR=\u27e8M2\u27e9\u2212\u27e8M\u27e92 ( 1/N ) \u2211jN{\u27e8xj2\u27e9\u2212\u27e8xj\u27e92} , where <> denotes time average . In a synchronised cellular state , the averaged signal gives rise to a pronounced amplitude , resulting in R=1 . The fully desynchronised cellular state , on the other hand , results in R=0 . To see the time evolution of the level of synchrony , the synchronisation index R ( t ) at time t was computed for windowed time traces of {xj ( s ) : t-12<s<t+12} ( window: 24\u00a0h ) . Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3 shows the analysis results based on the synchronisation index . The panels are ordered in correspondence with those of Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2 . Positive slopes are again found in the root tip , implying that the level of synchrony increases in time due to cell-cell interactions . The results are therefore consistent with the ones obtained by the order parameter . To examine the dependence of the synchronisation analysis on the particular experimental data set used , the order parameters were computed for the CCA1-long line . As shown in Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 4 , the slope of the order parameter for the CCA1-long line experiment is again well correlated with the cell density , where highly dense cells are located in the root tip . Although the time resolution was three times lower in this experiment , the same tendency was observed . The WT repeat experiment ( Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1 ) was not analysed , as the timeseries was too short and time resolution was too low to enable accurate synchronisation analysis . We constructed a model where we describe the dynamics of the CCA1::CCA1-YFP in each cell by a simple Kuramoto phase oscillator . For every cell at a position ( m , n ) in the plant ( when viewed in 2D with m denoting position in the horizontal direction and n denoting position in the vertical direction ) the phase of the oscillator \u03b8 ( m , n ) changes in time ( t ) so that d\u03b8 ( m , n ) dt=\u03c9 ( m , n ) +K\u2211\u27e8p . q\u27e9sin ( \u03b8 ( p , q ) \u2212\u03b8 ( m , n ) ) . Here \u03c9 ( m , n ) describes the intrinsic frequency of the oscillator and the second term describes the oscillator\u2019s dependence on the coupling to the nearest neighbours ( i . e . cells in positions ( p , q ) where p=m-1 , . . , m+1 and q=n-1 , . . . , n+1 ) with K as the coupling constant . The bioluminescence of each cell is then taken to be B ( m , n ) ( t ) =cos\u2061 ( \u03b8 ( m , n ) ( t ) ) +1 . Cells in the plant conform to a template that is taken to be a symmetric shape , and resembles the shape of a seedling . The total bioluminescence across each vertical section ( n ) of the plant is taken to be the sum of the bioluminescence of all cells along that section that\u00a0is , Btotnt=\u2211m=1NwBm , n ( t ) where the width of the plant counts Nw number of cells . The space-time plot shown in Figure 3k shows the total luminescence normalised so that the peak expression of each vertical section is 1 . In the model , we assume that the cells in the three sections ( the cotyledon/hypocotyl , the root and the root tip ) have different intrinsic periods , with the cells in the cotyledon and hypocotyl having period of 24 hr , those in the root having the period of around 25 . 55 hr and the ones in the root tip a period of 22 . 67 hr . These overall match the qualitative period differences seen across the different plant sections . In all simulations , the coupling constant K is arbitrarily set to 1 . The ODEs are solved using the Euler method .
