 the kingman s coalescent is a random tree introduced by @xcite as the genealogy arising in large population genetic models. it has infinitely many leaves and is usually constructed from leaves to the root as follows : given that there are @xmath7 lines in the tree, after some exponential time with rate @xm8, two lines are chosen uniformly and merged to one line, leaving the tree with @xxmath9 lines. we show that the probability of picking ( from the initial infinite population ) two leaves that belong to the same family is approximately @x.\end{aligned}.
 the multistep cascading is a relatively new phenomenon in optical fiber systems. it involves the simultaneous transmission of two - wave solitons in a multi - component nonlinear model. we describe the phenomenon of the long - distance propagation of _ temporal optical soliton _ in optical fibers and waveguides, and describe how it can be employed for soliton - induced waveguiding effects in multi - components nonlinear models. as a result, we describe several different physical examples of the multismep cascades associated with the multi - wave quasiperiodic soliton ( eqs ), including the one described by the css equation.

 microlensing is an excellent way to search for planets, as first suggested by mao & paczynki ( 1991 ) and further developed by gould & loeb ( 1992 ). the discovery of a massive compact object ( such as a star, black hole, etc. ) in the galactic bulge, has led to the establishment of international collaborations such as mps and moa collaborations for macho 98-blg-35, which obtain sub - day to sub - hourly photometry on events discovered by the survey teams macho, ogle and eros.
 the value of the circular orbital velocity at the sun s radius in the milky way is of considerable interest in galactic and extragalactic astrophysics. we present a new population of maser kinematics associated with the Milky Way. this population of masers is based on the maser data, and is based upon the data obtained from r09, which is a very long baseline array ( vlba ) and is used to model the dynamics of the galaxy.
 the @xmath4-channel resonance is formed by a single partial wave matching to spin and parity of the resonance. it is the first time that the analyzing power of the @xcite has been used in the analysis of the data in a complete way. the results of this experiment show that the analysis power is smallest at the lowest energy of the magnetic field in the magnetic resonance region, but with a significant effect on the analysis capacity of the analyzing powers in the resonance region.
 background : the luminosity function of the globular clusters is a relatively well - defined parameter in the photometry of these clusters. we report a small improvement in the quality and quantity of data on the low mass end of the stellar initial mass function ( lf ) from observations of globular cluster luminosity functions ( ngc 2420 and ngc2477 ), and we show that the lf of ngc 2320 is significantly higher than that of the open cluster lfs ( holtzman _ et al. _ ( 1995b ), but this is not the case for the open clusters, which are the subject of this paper.
 the miri medium resolution spectrometer ( mrs ) is an integral field unit ( ifu ) that is a wide array of mirrors with a wide beam waist. the mrs is a highly efficient spectrometric instrument that can be used in the infrared and at cryogenic temperatures, and hence is well suited for use in the spectroscopic field of view.materials and methodsthe mrs consists of four spectrometers, each with its own ifu @xcite, which is mounted on a single wheel and is used to divide the spectral band between the two focal plane arrays. in the beam waist, the laser beam waist is offset to the width of the slit.
 jastrow basis functions are a generalization of gutzwiller s approach @xcite in which a nonlinear function is used to count and control the electron count on a single atom. however, they are not well suited for stenciling in strongly correlated regimes, where the best current option is to rely on a factorial - cost determinantal expansion. in this paper, we discuss the feasibility of jastrows of the type given in eq, which are compatible with the variational monte carlo approach, and how to use them in a general - purpose stencils.
 we propose a method to extract unknown coupling parameters introduced for the case of one parameter in the @xmath18, which has since been used for various reactions. we describe a method that can be used to extract the unknown couplings from their measured mean values and to compare them with their form in the standard model. in this paper, we describe the method of optimal observables, which is based on the linearisation of the couplings, and the analysis of the results of the analysis.
 we present 4d gauge theories that describe physics on 5d curved geometries. we first describe a 4d model with the gravitationally symmetric form @xmath18, which is a hypermultiplet of the massless vector field @xxmath72, which has a mass of 0.5d, and which is localized at the gv\bar c'_{i+1} dimensions. in this paper, we discuss the localization behavior of the graviton mass, the spinor mass, and the mass of the vector fields @xm87, which are localized along the warped background. in the next section, we describe a 5d model of graviton masses, which have a mass, spinor, and scalar mass, respectively.
 the study of the formation and evolution of galaxies is one of the most important issues of present - day astronomy. the currently favoured models suggest that large galaxies such as the milky way formed through the hierarchical accretion of a number of smaller objects. our simulations suggest that the formation of very metal poor stars is due to a dearth of very heavy stars ( vmpss ), and that the mass of the star is still active, even if only for stars with @xmath0}\leq-3 $ ]. in order to investigate whether this dearth is consistent with the simple hypothesis that the gas in the sculptor dsph ( hereafter, scl ) was completely self - enriched in metals, the simulations were aimed at reproducing the chemical properties of the sculptureor dsm ( hereafter, scl ). we used numerical simulations of chemical enrichment of dwarf galaxies to investigate, for the first time, the metallicity distribution of stars in the simulated galaxy.
 the dynamical density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) @xcite is the most widely used deconvolution method for one - dimensional systems and quantum impurity problems. it is a simple and well - defined deconvolved spectrum of a finite - system spectrum with a narrow lorentzian broadening @xmath146. we have used the deconvolve method to obtain the piecewise smooth spectrum of an infinite system spectrum from a broadened finite system spectrum. the deconvection of the ddmrg spectrum has been performed using a minimization of the cost function @xmrg.
 the concept of balance in the non - hermitian quantum mechanics has been well developed as the complex extension of conventional quantum mechanics. we investigate the role of the quantum mechanics in the construction of a semi - infinite non-Hermitian system without @xmath3 symmetry breaking. in this paper, we describe a non - Hermitian model with a unique dynamic spectrum and study the dynamics of the wave functions in the system. the results of this study are summarized in figs.
 the vft thermal activation law is a central experimental law which controls the rate of transition in bulk polymer systems@xcite. it is the first experimental law to be derived from the empirical vft law of transition rates. the empirical principle of the vFT thermal activation laws is that @xmath18 per link determining the chain mobility also determines the dynamical glass transition temperature in the empirical Vft law. we have the empirical proof that the closed chain activation law has a vft form given by eq.
 we present a theoretical investigation of polarization squeezing generated by an ensemble of x - like 4-level atoms in an optical cavity driven by a linearly polarized field @xcite. we show that self - rotation is responsible for polarization switching and saturation leads to tristability in the optical pumping regime. in this section, we describe the dynamics of the optical pump and the effects of the kerr effect on the absorption and dispersion of the field. the results are summarized in fig [ fig3 ].
 the rank - three tensor model is a theory of dynamical commutative nonassociative fuzzy spaces. it is based on the fact that the generalized generalized generalized quantum gravity ( generalized matrix model ) is a successful tool to analyze the two - dimensional simplicial gravity, but it has not been successful in this direction, partly because of the absence of analytical methods to solve it and of physically appropriate interpretations of its partition function. this paper gives a summary of the results obtained so far concerning the emergence of the general relativity in the tensor models.
 the mystery of the dark energy / cosmological constant persists despite great efforts of particle physicists and cosmologists to find a convincing solution. since the famous article by s. weinberg on the cosmology of dark energy, it is well known that candidate models should not only explain the smallness of the cosmic constant, if it is somehow related to quantum gravity, but also what is called the coincidence problem i.e. why does dark energy become dominant quite late in the history of the universe? here we suggest an alternative to a primordial quintessence field. we summarize our preliminary results in two following figures.the first figure shows @xmath9 of the fit of quintessences models on the publicly available super - novae ia data.
 the @xmath2 limit of qcd is the most general potential that describes the dynamics of the heavy meson - heavy antimeson pair. we have used the @xcite to obtain a molecular scheme based on several qcd symmetries in the @Xmath17 limit of the qcd, which is the lowest energy constants or counter - terms ( lecs ), up to corrections of the order @xm5, and by the nsfc ( grant no. 11165005 ) to obtain the potentials in every possible channel.
 we present a new photometry technique for precise time - series photometry of non - crowded fields with a highly varying psf. the photometry is based on the concentric aperture photometry algorithm in daophot package @xcite, which is optimized for wide - field time domain astronomy.materials and methodsthe photometry used for this study was performed with the multichannel image collection of the open cluster m37 ( mmt / megacam).resultswe obtained a total of 23,790 data points from the m37, including a total number of 30,294 images, which were analyzed using the glacial - scale photometry method. in addition, we computed the rms photometric precision of the re - calibrated light curves ( @xmath34-axis ) using the sigma - clipping method.resultswe found that the photometric accuracy was superior to that of the raw data, with the exception of a small fraction of the observed data points.
 factorization of numbers into their prime factors is a hard non - polynomial problem for classical computers. the gauss sums can be used successfully to factorize numbers on a quantum computer with a tremendous speedup as compared to a classical computer. in the present paper, we investigate how truncated fourier sum and its generalizations, like truncated gauss, kummer and exponential sums, could emerge from superposition of several oscillations. in this paper, we describe how the truncated fourier sum can be applied to factorizing numbers based on multiple oscillations, including the linear phase @xmath44, and the quadratic phase @xcite.
 we show that a computable learning algorithm can be efficient in the sense of running in polynomial time of certain parameters @xmath74. this paper shows that a single learning algorithm, with a finite number of samples, can be used to evaluate all computable classifiers in a finite vc - dimension, and obtain an algorithm with asymptotically optimal computation time.conclusionsconventional statistical learning theory attempts to bound the number of sample complexity to a specified level of accuracy for each of the above models ( e.g. neural networks, support vector machines ). here, we show the absence of distribution independent bounds on sample complexity for computable universal learning algorithms.

 the gaseous component of protoplanetary disks is crucial for understanding the planet formation process because it affects the structures and evolution of the disk via chemical reactions. we present the results of [ c i ] @xmath1@xmath2 ( 492.161 ghz ) and co ( 461.041 ghz) observations toward three classical t tauri stars ( ttss ), l1551 irs 5 and hl tau, and, in november 2010 using the atacama submillimeter telescope experiment.
 molecular discreteness is a phenomenon that occurs when the concentration of a certain chemical species is small. we investigate the effects of the discreteeness on the behavior of the system with a small number of molecules. in this case, we consider the case where @xmath13 is species - dependent and the inflow of the chemical is species dependent. in the 2 - 4 rich state, the system is dominated by diffusion, and the outflow of the molecules is species-dependent. in addition, we observe that the rate of the reaction, which is dependent on @xxmath18, is larger than that of the rate equation of the reactant.

 background: chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia ( cmmol ) is a rare disease with an incidence of 0.370.72 per 100 000 population. the median age at diagnosis varies between 65 years and 75 years [ 14 ]. the radical treatment is allogeneic stem cell transplantation, although this treatment is unsuitable for most patients because of their advanced age [ 6, 7 ]. in the present case, we performed an oral hydroxyurea ( hydrea ) treatment to clean the inflamed region in his mouth.
 bivalirudin is a promising anticoagulant for cardiopulmonary bypass ( cpb ) and ecmo. it is recommended that, in the event of echocardiographic evidence of a'smoke effect'within one or more cardiac chambers, it should be replaced by standard heparin anticoagulation. we think that, during cpb, blood stagnation in the circuit be avoided because the rapid cleavage of bivalirudin may result in thrombosis.
 coronary angiography ( mdct ) is a promising imaging method for the evaluation of coronary artery disease. the purpose of this study was to assess lv ejection fraction ( lvef ) using 64-slice as a byproduct of coronary angiology. we evaluated the efficacy of mdct in patients with a low radiation dose, prospective gating, and coronary angiologist ( ct ) gating technique. in addition, we compared mdct with the ct gating method, which was used in a heterogeneous patient population.
 the bacterium moraxella catarrhalis is a gram - negative, aerobic diplococcus human mucosal pathogen which causes middle ear infections in infants and children [ 13 ], and it is one of the three major causes of otitis media along with streptococcus pneumonia and haemophilus influenzae. we report the discovery of a bioassay - guided fractionation of a bacterium derived from the genus of aristolochia bracteolata.
 we report a case of an infected thoracic aortic aneurysm mimicking anca - associated vasculitis. the patient was admitted to the nagoya city university hospital with a fever, which persisted for three weeks, along with a loss of appetite, proteinuria, hematuria, and renal dysfunction. a contrast - enhanced computed tomography ( ct ) revealed a pseudoaneurysm in the descending aorta, which suggested that the patient had an infected aneurysm.
 endometriosis is a common cause of infertility, pelvic pain, dysmenorrhea, and dyspareunia in reproductive - age women. the prevalence is high and the treatments are based on these unclear mechanisms. in this randomized, double - blind, randomized clinical trial, we investigated the effect of vitamin d supplementation on cessation of pain in the first 6 months after laparoscopic diagnosis and treatment in women with endometriosis and also in women who had other benign gynecological conditions.resultswe compared the serum and peritoneal levels of 25-dihydroxy vitamin d3 ( cholecalciferol ) and placebo on severity of pelvic pain and/or pelvic pain at second menses after operative laparoscopy.
 the purpose of this study was to compare the apical microleakage and gap formation of ah plus / gutta - percha with epiphany sealer and epiphany system. the apical gap formation was evaluated using secondary electron microscopy ( se ) mode and corresponding energy dispersive spectroscopy ( eds ) spectrum of agno3 leakage.resultsthe apical gap was divided into 5 regions of 1 mm to evaluate microleaking.
 neonatal diabetes mellitus ( pndm ) is a monogenic form of diabetes characterized by defects in pancreatic beta cell development and function. the most common causes of neonatal diabetic mellitus are insulin hypersensitivity, insulin hypersensitive, and insulin secretion in the early 6 months of life. in this study, we report a case of p.h186d heterozygous mutation in the kcnj11 gene, encoding the subunit kir6.2, c.556c > g ( p.his186asp ).
 acute renal failure ( arf ) is an important cause of hospital - acquired arf and is responsible for 12% of cases. radiocontrast - induced nephropathy ( rin ) can lead to acute kidney failure ( rf ), which may require dialysis therapy. urine il-18 levels are useful for detecting rin. in this study, we aimed to compare the plasma creatinine levels in comparison with spot urea nitrogen ( bun ) levels in response to radiocontrast agent administration. in conclusion, spot urine il -18 levels were measured with a human iopromid.
 hyaluronic acid ( ha ) is a novel antiadhesive and antibiofilm coating for the treatment of peri - prosthetic joint infections ( pji ). it has been shown to significantly reduce bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation on the surface of polymethylmethacrylate intraocular lenses ( iols ). in this prospective, randomized, double - blind, placebo - controlled study, hyaluronan - based hydrogel was used to reduce bacterial adhesive adhesion to the surface and to prevent bacterial adhesive formation. in the mean time to uti recurrence, the effect of ha on the adhesion density of pd5 mm was significantly lower in the study group ( p value = 0.024 ) compared to the control group.conclusionshyaluric acid has a proven in vitro antiadhesion / antibiofil effect against some of the most common bacterial pathogens.
 antimicrobial resistance ( amr ) poses a major threat to patient's treatment as it leads to increased morbidity and mortality, increased hospital stay, and severe economic loss to the patient and nation [ 3, 4 ]. this short term cross - sectional study was undertaken to detect the incidence of mdr, xdr, and pandrug - resistant ( pdr ) bacteria in a tertiary care hospital of central india. in the present study, 250 ( 33.5% ) strains were detected from pseudomonas aeruginosa, methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus ( mrsa ), enterococci especially vancomycin resistant enterococcus ( vre ), and members of family enterobacteriaceae.
 ureterocele is a congenital urinary abnormality characterized by the presence of an intrabladder hernia or cystic ballooning of the lower end of a urester lying between the mucosa and muscle of the bladder. ureters can have different clinical presentations, such as antenatal hydronephrosis, uti, vesicoureteral reflux ( vur ), bladder outlet obstruction, prolapsed urethral mass, etc. tc - dimercapto succinic acid ( dmsa ) scan should be undertaken routinely to assess the distribution of function in the duplex kidney and for detecting and follow - up of scarred tissue and nonfunctioning upper poles in cases of uretherocele.
 the purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of vertebral fractures on the quality of life of healthy, community - dwelling women aged 65 years or older using the qualeffo questionnaire. the questionnaire was used to assess the impact on the health of the patients with osteoporosis, osteopenia, or normal bone density.resultsthe questionnaire was validated by individual interviews using the genant semi - quantitative method and the kruskal - wallis test.resultsmethods and methodsthe questionnaire included a total score of 0.033 g / cm for the lumbar spine, femoral neck, and total femur, and a two - sided 5% significance level.resultssthe results were compared between women with and without fractures and those without fractures using the qalffo.resultsresultsthe results for both the vertebral fracture assessment ( qalf ) and the qALffo were compared with those of the other groups ( p<0.001).resultssthis results showed that the presence of at least one fracture was negatively associated with the total qualefo score.
 endometrial sampling is an effective and acceptable method for obtaining endometri samples for histopathological assessment. however, it is more problematic in postmenopausal women, for whom the need for admission and general anesthesia and their associated costs have made this option less favorable. in our institution, the use of the explora model i tool has been widely considered to be the method of choice for obtaining adequate endometrally accurate endometrial samples for the detection of endometral hyperplasia or carcinoma.
 background : the pebas system is a complex mosaic of avulsive rivers and associated wetlands, which originates in the andes. it is suggested to have been deposited in a fluvial overbank environment. principle, it is difficult to determine the origin of this system, but it is widely accepted that it was formed in the late Miocene ( 23 ma ) due to the high amount of overbank fines. theory, however, it has not been proven to be a fully formed lake.
 incidental adrenal enlargement has become a common clinical problem in china. however, there is a lack of literature on functional status and its follow - up to provide comprehensive insight to these findings. in this retrospective study, we examined the prevalence of incidental adrenals enlargement in a tertiary referral hospital with endocrinological departments in chinese. we included 578 patients with adrenal imaging features showing adrenal hyperplasia, which was detected in 64 cases, giving a prevalence of 11.3%.
 background : the lack of health knowledge among caregivers is a major cause of mortality in children less than 60 months in developing countries. we try to raise families health knowledge about infectious diseases by a method that uses children as health agents.methods : we used the method of interventional pre and post series to conduct our research.results:the results show that children have done better in pre - test and post - test about all topics except brucellosis. in addition, parents have had acceptable information about the importance of unpasteurized milk and yogurt in their children's health.
 septic arthritis of the shoulder is uncommon in adults. it is a surgical emergency as joint destruction occurs rapidly and can lead to significant morbidity and mortality. this case highlights the importance of maintaining high index of suspicion in patients presenting with atypical shoulder pain associated with stiffness. in this case report, a 43 years old man presented to the orthopaedic outpatient clinic with at least 2 months history of pain and limited range of motion in his left shoulder. on examination, his shoulder movements were severely restricted. on physical examination, hematogenous seeding of shoulder joint was observed.
 split - liver transplantation ( slt ) is an attractive alternative procedure to expand the donor pool in patients waiting for liver transplantation. we describe an uncommon late biliary complication that occurred after slt and was successfully treated by a multidisciplinary approach. the patient underwent a percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography ( ptc ) using a t - tube for the obliteration of isolated segmental bile ducts in four cases.
 background : the use of rr inhibitors as radiosensitizers in the treatment of locally advanced cervical cancer has been a significant advance in our understanding of the biological interactions between rr and diphosphates, the fundamental building blocks of diphysis. recent studies have demonstrated that rr is involved in the cellular response to ionizing radiation ( ir ). in addition, many studies investigating the mechanism of action of hu were carried out, resulting in a far clearer understanding of this pathway from a number of well - done pre - clinical studies.
 the study of long bones and the cells of the bone marrow is central to a myriad of research disciplines, including, but not limited to, bone biology, cancer biology, immunology, hematology, and biomechanics. the bone is a highly dynamic organ that together with the cartilage forms the skeleton to provide mechanical support against loading and protection of the internal organs. bone and bone marrow are a storage sink for the critical signaling molecules calcium and phosphorus, as well as other factors.
 tuberculosis ( tb ) is a major health issue in developing countries with over two billion people being infected with tuberculosis bacilli world wide ( 1 ). although tb was recently regarded primarily as a disease of the developing countries it is now also on the increase in developed countries such as the united kingdom, mainly as a result of globalisation as well as an increase in immunosuppressed patients. the incidence of tb in the uk increased by 5.5% in 2009 when compared to those in 2008 ( 2 ).
 the value of the ketogenic diet ( kd ) has been recognized in the treatment of epilepsy, although the exact mechanisms by which it exerts its effect remain an enigma. the kd is comprised of four elements, the changes of which can potentially lead to changes in gene expression which in turn result in some of the above - noted changes in the gene expression of the free fatty acids ( ffas ) in the brain, leading to increased energy reserves. this effect can be crucial for the application of the anticonvulsant effect in medical conditions other than intractable epilepsy.
 the endotracheal tube ( ett ) should be placed at the optimal level to avoid inadvertent complication. the mid - tracheal level, which is considered the optimal depth of ett, can be predicted by the surface distance between the cricoid cartilage and the suprasternal notch, and the upper incisor and the carina in the neutral neck position.conclusionthe purpose of this study was to determine whether surface anatomical landmarks can be used to predict the mid- trachea level in adults, especially in females.
 this paper examines the ethical implications of donation to stem cell research in the united kingdom. the purpose of this study is to examine the social and ethical meanings that are emerging around the act of donating embryos to research. in addition, we examine the implications of this ethical concern for the use of surplus embryos in research, and how they are stabilised and used in the future. in the u.k. and chinese studies, participants were asked to decide whether or not to donate or to refuse to donate their surplus embryos to stem cells research.
 thyroid cancer is the most common endocrine neoplasia which accounts for about 1% of human cancers. it is a rare but significant endocrine disease that is increasingly managed by pediatric providers. we discuss the etiology of pediatric mtc and currently available therapeutic modality for the cancer. we also discuss the role of the ret gene mutation in the early development of mtc in the men type 2 syndromes and the pathophysiology of the disease. in this review, we discuss how the ret mutation in men2b is associated with the early onset of hereditary mtc.
 the biomechanical model of the brain is based on a linear elastic model, which is used to model the deformation of the skull and dura. it is also based on the geometry of the imr images, and it can be deformed in accordance with the displacement field of the adjacent imr image. in this paper, we describe two patient cases that illustrate our approach for handling brain shift followed by successive resections. in the first category, we describe the biomechical model, based on two time - point images, that is, the whole - brain region boundary, and the internal tumor region boundary. in both cases, we use a linear finite element ( fem or xfem ) to model brain shift.
 n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids ( pufa ) have been suggested to decrease and increase the incidence of gastroesophageal reflux disease ( gi ). however, the use of pufas in the treatment of gi cancer is controversial. the use and application of pfa in the prevention and treatment of cancer has been controversial, especially in the context of the increasing incidence of colorectal cancer, and the risk of esophagusal adenocarcinoma.
 46xy dsd is a rare condition characterized by ambiguous female genitalia, bilateral streak gonads, and elevated gonadotropins. it is the most common cause of 46x dsd. in our study, 11 patients were reared as female and three ( s.10, s.11, and s.12 ) with ambiguous genitalia. in the absence of gonadal development, the diagnosis of 46xy is difficult. in this study, we evaluated the clinical, hormonal, radiological, and radiological profiles of 46y dsd patients.
 background: methicillin - resistant staphylococcus aureus ( mrsa ) is an opportunistic pathogen affecting both immune competent and immunocompromised individuals, frequently resulting in significant morbidity. we chronologically assessed the source, patient demographics, and antimicrobial susceptibilities of mra - positive isolates from the hospital and community setting over a 5-year period in university hospital waterford a tertiary referral hospital with the primary microbiology laboratory for 4 acute hospitals, serving a total catchment area of almost 500,000, excluding 2 small private elective inpatient institutions.
 acquired c1inh deficiency is a rare disorder which can cause severe abdominal pain mimicking an acute surgical abdomen. we describe a case of a patient who developed incapacitating, recurrent severe abdominal pains, culminating in partial bowel resection. in this case, we describe the patient with atherosclerotic vascular disease who developed acute bowel edema, culminating with partial bowel s resection. the patient had a history of abdominal pain, which frequently corresponds to chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( cll ).
 the purpose of this study was to analyze the overall and comparative clinico - radiological outcomes ( radiographic and ultrasonographic ) of surgical treatment of a lateral clavicle fracture with a joint - spanning implant and coracoclavicular ligament reconstruction using endobutton device. the hospital records of all patients who were surgically treated for lateral clava fractures between 2005 and 2008 at three hospitals were retrospectively evaluated to identify the study group. the results were summarized in table 1. a combination of a joint- spanning implant alone ( group 1 ), and a joint sparing implant ( group 2 ) resulted in stable fixation and comminution.
 a 68-year - old woman visited the clinic with the chief complaints of pain, swelling, and a warm sensation in her left thigh for over 2 days prior to her visit. the patient also complained about a warm feeling during the nighttime but body temperature was normal when measured in the clinic.conclusionthe potential for a deep vein thrombosis requires continuous thought and attention regarding relevant examinations for patients at high risk for thrombosis as well as for embolism ( e.g., polycythemia vera ).
