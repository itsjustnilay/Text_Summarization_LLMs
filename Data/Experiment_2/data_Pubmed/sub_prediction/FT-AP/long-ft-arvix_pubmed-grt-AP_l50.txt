we present a study of anxiety in parkinson's disease ( pd ) patients with and without anxiety. the results support the hypothesis that anxiety influences attentional set - shifting and working memory performance in pd. pd patients with anxiety have higher cognitive performance on the hads - a ( tmt - a, z - score ) compared to those without anxiety, suggesting that anxiety may have a role to play in cognitive performance in the central executive and attentional systems of working memory.
the role of small non - coding rna in breast cancer cell cycle and cellular proliferation is well studied. the discovery of distinct mirnas in human breast cancer cells and human breast cell lines suggests that they may represent novel cancer therapy. mirna - specific rna are the most promising targets for cancer treatment, and may represent potential novel strategies for breast cancer therapy. in particular, mirna regulation of mammary gland tumorigenesis in the g1-s phase transition and suppression of metastasis in the breast cancer stem cell lines may provide potential novel cancer therapies. in addition, the presence of mirna in the body of the breast is a potential indication of a novel cancer treatment. 
we report on the role of pigtail catheter drainage in the management of severe ohss in patients who underwent in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer at our centre between 1999 and 2001 on both inpatient and outpatient basis. we demonstrate that the pigtails catheter is the most effective treatment modality in the treatment of severe and critical ohss. the pigtail kheter is used in the outpatient management of patients with early onset ohss and in the intensive care unit.
congenital adrenal hyperplasia ( cah ) refers to a group of autosomal recessive disorders caused by an enzyme deficiency which leads to defects in biosynthesis of steroid precursors. the clinical spectrum may vary from mild to severe form of non classical cah to classic cah. it is also known that the condition may be associated with obesity and hypertension, and that it may be related to the presence of mullerian structures with a phallic length of around 6 cm.
we investigate the anti - hyperglycemic effects of streptozotocin ( ptx ) on the production of anti - inflammatory cytokines in type 1 diabetes in mice. we demonstrate that pentoxifylline treatment can prevent the development of type 1d in mice by increasing the levels of the cyclic nucleotides cyclic adenosine monophosphate ( cgmp ) and suppress proliferation of lymphocytes induced by con a after 72 hr ( * p<0.05 ). in addition, we investigate whether ptx could prevent or attenuate the onset of diabetes in diabetic mice. in the present study, the effects of ptx on the proliferation of non - fasted mice are discussed.
we present a cross - sectional study of asthma patients treated at the clementino fraga filho university hospital in brazil. the study population was divided into two groups according to the clinical severity of asthma and the non - severe asthma ( ma ) group, comprising patients with mild intermittent or persistent asthma and those with moderate or severe asthma. we found a significant increase in the prevalence of staphylococcal toxin - specific ige antibodies in patients with severe asthma and healthy individuals.
the family needs of hospitalized patients in the neurosurgery intensive care unit of al - zahra hospital are studied. the study was performed with respect to the existing gap for a study carried out for investigating the effectiveness of nursing interventions based on the needs of the families in the special care units and their families in iran. in this study, the results showed that performing the training based on family needs in the icu, decreased the anxiety and increased their satisfaction.
in this study, the role of independent variable ( peplau ) in reducing hospital anxiety and depression is discussed. the study was conducted in the context of the need to develop new approaches in the treatment and rehabilitation of patients with cardiovascular diseases. it is shown that the role is important to establish a coherent and targeted therapeutic communication model in reducing the anxiety level in the intervention group and to solve problems and meet their needs. in addition, the study found significant differences between experimental and control groups in terms of anxiety level immediately after surgery, two and four months after surgery after adjustment for post - test scores by eliminating the effect of pre - test. in fact, the effect on the patient anxiety scores was lower than the control group.
the ha1 hemagglutinin nucleotide sequences from 26 nepal isolates and h3n2 vaccine strains were analyzed by using the superscript iii one - step rt - pcr system ( invitrogen ). the nucleotides of the ha proteins were compared with the a / wellington/3/03 vaccine strain ( a / wyoming/4/03 ) and the a/ wyomoming/3-03 vaccine strains.
we investigate the relationship between obesity and physiological dysregulation in three aging societies : the us, england, and taiwan. we find that obesity is associated with a higher biological risk and a lower biological risk compared to those in the us and england. our results are consistent with previous studies that have found that obesity in the me has a greater biological risk than in the england and englands, and that it may be due to differences in physical activity, diet, and other behavioral factors.

the bacterium moraxella catarrhalis is a gram - negative, aerobic diplococcus human mucosal pathogen which causes middle ear infections in infants and children [ 13 ], and it is one of the three major causes of otitis media along with streptococcus pneumonia and haemophilus influenzae. it is also a potential candidate for the development of a new, safe, and effective anti - inflammatory drug to replace the use of the harmful crude plant material.
an infected aortic aneurysm with an infected thoracic aorta was diagnosed with an anca - associated vasculitis. the patient had a history of orbital mucosa - associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma, which was in remission after treatment with methylprednisolone pulse therapy ( 500 mg / day ) for three days. we report an unusual case of infected descending aortac pseudoaneurysm ( pr3-anca ) with luminal pathognomonic oscillating vegetation and with serological findings mimicking pr3 -anca -associated vasculis.
we investigated the effect of vitamin d on endometriosis in a double - blind, randomized clinical trial. we compared the serum and peritoneal levels of 25-dihydroxy vitamin d with high - performance liquid chromatography. the serum level of 25 hydroxy vitamin d was 24.914.8 ng / ml and 20.411.8, respectively ( p=0.05 ), and the severity of dysmenorrhea and pelvic pain were estimated using a visual analogue scale test ( vas test ).
a study of apical microleakage at the dentin / sealer interface was performed. it was shown that the presence of gaps at the root canal filling materials and the presence of gaps were significant when compared to the previous observation of gaps in the apical sealer and sealer interfaces, as the latter had a significant effect on apical microleaking and gap formation. in addition, a statistical analysis was performed to evaluate the effect of the association of epiphany primer and ah plus / gutta - percha with the absence of gap.
neonatal diabetes mellitus ( pndm ) is a monogenic form of diabetes that presents within the first 6 months of life. the condition is characterized by a novel heterozygous mutation in the kcnj11 gene encoding the subunit kir6.2, c.556c > g ( p.his186asp ), which induces the closure of katp channels that lead to insulin secretion by pancreatic beta cells. we report a case of neonatal diabetics with kcnjs11 mutation in a novel form of the knt11 gene whose treatment was successfully transitioned from insulin to oral sulfonylurea.
in this study, we examined spot urine il-18 levels in comparison with urine il -18 levels following radiocontrast agent administration. we found a weak positive correlation between precontrast 24 h and postcontrast 25 h after radioconontrast administration, suggesting that it may be an earlier parameter for identifying acute kidney injury. in contrast with nonionic iso - osmolar contrast agents, nonionic low osmol contrast agents on renal tubules are important for early detection of acute renal failure ( arf ).
in this prospective study, hyaluronic acid was applied to the surface of polystyrene plates containing polymethylmethacrylate intraocular lenses ( iols ) in order to prevent bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation. the effect of hyaluronan - containing hydrogels on the growth of biofilm cells on the surface was investigated. it was found that the effect on biofilm forming was significantly reduced in the study group compared with the control group.

in recent years, several studies have investigated the role of rr in the treatment of locally advanced cervical cancer. the most recent studies have focused on the efficacy of hu plus radiotherapy in combination with cisplatin and r2. these studies have shown that the response of r2 to ir is a significant mechanism of action in the response to ir, with a significant increase in r2 activity in the early responders and a significant decrease in dna damage. in addition, the results of these studies are consistent with those of previous studies.
we present a simple and efficient method for the dissection of mouse hind long bones and subsequent bone marrow isolation. the technique is suitable for many downstream applications, including flow cytometry and bone scoring. it is also suitable for the study of osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, scoliosis, and pathologic fracture. in addition, the centrifugation method preserves the high structural and cellular integrity of the bones and bone marrow and has low handling time, minimizing the likelihood of user - induced fracture or bone scoring that may influence downstream analyses.
tuberculosis ( tb ) is a major health issue in developing countries with over two billion people being infected with tuberculosis bacilli world wide ( 1 ). although tb was recently regarded primarily as a disease of the developing countries it is now also on the increase in developed countries such as the united kingdom, mainly as a result of globalisation as well as an increase in immunosuppressed patients. the incidence of tb in the uk is increasing by 5.5% in 2009 when compared to those in 2008 ( 2 ).
the value of the ketogenic diet ( kd ) has been recognized in the treatment of epilepsy, although the exact mechanisms by which it exerts its effect remain an enigma. it is suggested that the kd influences toward an upregulation of transcripts encoding energy metabolism enzymes and increase in the density of mitochondria in neuronal process, leading to heightened energy reserves. the effects of the increased amount of ketone bodies on cognition, alertness, and mood are well known, and clinical experience has shown that the effects on brain tumor growth are consistent with other suggested antiepileptic mechanisms.
the mid - tracheal level, which is considered the optimal depth of ett, can be predicted by the surface distance between the cuff and the ssn ( extcc - ssn ). this method can be used to predict the mid- trachea level in adults, especially in females. the mid level of et can be determined by the distance between suprasternal notch and the carina in the neutral neck position. in addition, the surface distances from the cricoid cartilage to the suprasinternal notch can be calculated to determine the optimal insertion depth.
we investigate the ethical implications of donation to stem cell research. we find that in the case of embryos that are not used for research, the motivation for donating is a different one. the motivation to donate is different from that of donating to research, but the motivation is the same. in both the chinese and swiss studies, the motivations for donating are different, and the motivations are different. in the u.k. study, i.e., the reasons for donating to stem cells research are different from those of the swiss study.
the etiology of hereditary endocrine neoplasia ( mtc ) is discussed. it is shown that mutations in the ret proto - oncogene ( tk2 ) in the extracellular domain of the ret tyrosine kinase receptor ( fmtc ) can lead to the early onset of aggressive metastatic mtc in all affected individuals, typically during the first year of life. in this review, we discuss the role of ret mutations in mtc and discuss the potential role of the genotypephenotype correlations to predict phenotype. we also discuss the importance of clinical testing for mtc.
we present a complete 3d framework for updating multimodal images with respect to surgical brain deformations. the model is deformed using a linear finite element model, and is used to model the deformation of the brain and the reformation of its internal tumor region boundary. we show that the model can be deformed in accordance with the displacement fields of the two imr images, and can be used for reformation modeling of the entire - brain region boundary and to model brain shift and resection.
we review prospective studies of the anti - tumor effects of n-3 pufa in the treatment of colorectal cancer using fat-1 transgenic mice. we find that n- 3 pufas may be beneficial for the prevention and treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease ( gi ) and other gi cancers, and are the most recent studies on the role of the n-4 pufac in the prevention of gi cancer.
46xy dsd is a rare condition characterized by ambiguous female genitalia and characterized by the absence of testicular tissue. the condition is caused by the disruption of various enzymes involved in the process of androgen synthesis. in this study, 46xy is characterized by a wide spectrum of phenotypes associated with ambiguous genitalia, including male and female genitals, asymmetric hypospadias, and elevated gonadotropin levels. it is also characterized by an absence of the testis. in 46xy, the diagnosis of 46xy has been confirmed by a multidisciplinary approach.
