however , their findings were inconsistent .\nthe first study found that working memory performance was worse in lpd patients with anxiety compared to rpd patients with anxiety , whereas the second study reported that , in lpd , apathy but not anxiety was associated with performance on nonverbally mediated executive functions and visuospatial tasks ( e.g. , tmt - b , wms - iii spatial span ) , while in rpd , anxiety but not apathy significantly correlated with performance on verbally mediated tasks ( e.g. , clock reading test and boston naming test ) .\nfurthermore , anxiety was significantly correlated with neuropsychological measures of attention and executive and visuospatial functions . taken together ,\nit is evident that there are limited and inconsistent findings describing the relationship between anxiety and cognition in pd and more specifically how anxiety might influence particular domains of cognition such as attention and memory and executive functioning .\nit is also striking that , to date , no study has examined the influence of anxiety on cognition in pd by directly comparing groups of pd patients with and without anxiety while excluding depression .\ngiven that research on healthy young adults suggests that anxiety reduces processing capacity and impairs processing efficiency , especially in the central executive and attentional systems of working memory [ 26 , 27 ] , we hypothesized that pd patients with anxiety would show impairments in attentional set - shifting and working memory compared to pd patients without anxiety .\nfurthermore , since previous work , albeit limited , has focused on the influence of symptom laterality on anxiety and cognition , we also explored this relationship .\nseventeen pd patients with anxiety and thirty - three pd patients without anxiety were included in this study ( see table 1 ) .\nthe cross - sectional data from these participants was taken from a patient database that has been compiled over the past 8 years ( since 2008 ) at the parkinson 's disease research clinic at the brain and mind centre , university of sydney .\ninclusion criteria involved a diagnosis of idiopathic pd according to the united kingdom parkinson 's disease society brain bank criteria   and were confirmed by a neurologist ( sjgl ) .\npatients also had to have an adequate proficiency in english and have completed a full neuropsychological assessment .\nten patients in this study ( 5 pd with anxiety ; 5 pd without anxiety ) were taking psychotropic drugs ( i.e. , benzodiazepine or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ) .\npatients were also excluded if they had other neurological disorders , psychiatric disorders other than affective disorders ( such as anxiety ) , or if they reported a score greater than six on the depression subscale of the hospital anxiety and depression scale ( hads ) .\nthus , all participants who scored within a  depressed  ( hads - d > 6 ) range were excluded from this study , in attempt to examine a refined sample of pd patients with and without anxiety in order to determine the independent effect of anxiety on cognition .\nthis research was approved by the human research ethics committee of the university of sydney , and written informed consent was obtained from all participants .\nself - reported hads was used to assess anxiety in pd and has been previously shown to be a useful measure of clinical anxiety in pd .\na cut - off score of > 8 on the anxiety subscale of the hads ( hads - a ) was used to identify pd cases with anxiety ( pda+ ) , while a cut - off score of < 6 on the hads - a was used to identify pd cases without anxiety ( pda ) .\nthis criterion was more stringent than usual ( > 7 cut - off score ) , in effort to create distinct patient groups .\nthe neurological evaluation rated participants according to hoehn and yahr ( h&y ) stages   and assessed their motor symptoms using part iii of the revised mds task force unified parkinson 's disease rating scale ( updrs ) . in a similar way\nthis was determined by calculating a total left and right score from rigidity items 3035 , voluntary movement items 3643 , and tremor items 5057 from the mds - updrs part iii ( see table 1 ) .\nprocessing speed was assessed using the trail making test , part a ( tmt - a , z - score ) .\nattentional set - shifting was measured using the trail making test , part b ( tmt - b , z - score ) .\nworking memory was assessed using the digit span forward and backward subtest of the wechsler memory scale - iii ( raw scores ) .\nlanguage was assessed with semantic and phonemic verbal fluency via the controlled oral word associated test ( cowat animals and letters , z - score ) .\nthe ability to retain learned verbal memory was assessed using the logical memory subtest from the wechsler memory scale - iii ( lm - i z - score , lm - ii z - score , % lm retention z - score ) . the mini - mental state examination ( mmse )\ndemographic , clinical , and neuropsychological variables were compared between the two groups with the independent t - test or mann  whitney u test , depending on whether the variable met parametric assumptions .\nchi - square tests were used to examine gender and symptom laterality differences between groups .\nall analyses employed an alpha level of p < 0.05 and were two - tailed .\nspearman correlations were performed separately in each group to examine associations between anxiety and/or depression ratings and cognitive functions .\nas expected , the pda+ group reported significant greater levels of anxiety on the hads - a ( u = 0 , p < 0.001 ) and higher total score on the hads ( u = 1 , p < 0.001 ) compared to the pda group ( table 1 ) .\ngroups were matched in age ( t(48 ) = 1.31 , p = 0.20 ) , disease duration ( u = 259 , p = 0.66 ) , updrs - iii score ( u = 250.5 , p = 0.65 ) , h&y ( u = 245 , p = 0.43 ) , ledd ( u = 159.5 , p = 0.80 ) , and depression ( hads - d ) ( u = 190.5 , p = 0.06 ) .\nadditionally , all groups were matched in the distribution of gender (  = 0.098 , p = 0.75 ) and side - affected (  = 0.765 , p = 0.38 ) .\nthere were no group differences for tmt - a performance ( u = 256 , p = 0.62 ) ( table 2 ) ; however , the pda+ group had worse performance on the trail making test part b ( t(46 ) = 2.03 , p = 0.048 ) compared to the pda group ( figure 1 ) .\nthe pda+ group also demonstrated significantly worse performance on the digit span forward subtest ( t(48 ) = 2.22 , p = 0.031 ) and backward subtest ( u = 190.5 , p = 0.016 ) compared to the pda group ( figures 2(a ) and 2(b ) ) .\nneither semantic verbal fluency ( t(47 ) = 0.70 , p = 0.49 ) nor phonemic verbal fluency ( t(47 ) = 0.39 , p = 0.70 ) differed between groups .\nlogical memory i immediate recall test ( u = 176 , p = 0.059 ) showed a trend that the pda+ group had worse new verbal learning and immediate recall abilities than the pda group . however , logical memory ii test performance ( u = 219 , p = 0.204 ) and logical memory % retention ( u = 242.5 , p = 0.434 ) did not differ between groups .\nthere were also no differences between groups in global cognition ( mmse ) ( u = 222.5 , p = 0.23 ) .\nparticipants were split into lpd and rpd , and then further group differences were examined between pda+ and pda. importantly , the groups remained matched in age , disease duration , updrs - iii , dde , h&y stage , and depression but remained significantly different on self - reported anxiety .\nlpda+ demonstrated worse performance on the digit span forward test ( t(19 ) = 2.29 , p = 0.033 ) compared to lpda , whereas rpda+ demonstrated worse performance on the digit span backward test ( u = 36.5 , p = 0.006 ) , lm - i immediate recall ( u = 37.5 , p = 0.008 ) , and lm - ii ( u = 45.0 , p = 0.021 ) but not lm % retention ( u = 75.5 , p = 0.39 ) compared to rpda.\nthis study is the first to directly compare cognition between pd patients with and without anxiety .\nthe findings confirmed our hypothesis that anxiety negatively influences attentional set - shifting and working memory in pd .\nmore specifically , we found that pd patients with anxiety were more impaired on the trail making test part b which assessed attentional set - shifting , on both digit span tests which assessed working memory and attention , and to a lesser extent on the logical memory test which assessed memory and new verbal learning compared to pd patients without anxiety . taken together ,\nthese findings suggest that anxiety in pd may reduce processing capacity and impair processing efficiency , especially in the central executive and attentional systems of working memory in a similar way as seen in young healthy adults [ 26 , 27 ] .\nalthough the neurobiology of anxiety in pd remains unknown , many researchers have postulated that anxiety disorders are related to neurochemical changes that occur during the early , premotor stages of pd - related degeneration [ 37 , 38 ] such as nigrostriatal dopamine depletion , as well as cell loss within serotonergic and noradrenergic brainstem nuclei ( i.e. , raphe nuclei and locus coeruleus , resp . , which provide massive inputs to corticolimbic regions ) . over time\n, chronic dysregulation of adrenocortical and catecholamine functions can lead to hippocampal damage as well as dysfunctional prefrontal neural circuitries [ 39 , 40 ] , which play a key role in memory and attention .\nrecent functional neuroimaging work has suggested that enhanced hippocampal activation during executive functioning and working memory tasks may represent compensatory processes for impaired frontostriatal functions in pd patients compared to controls . therefore , chronic stress from anxiety ,\nfor example , may disrupt compensatory processes in pd patients and explain the cognitive impairments specifically in working memory and attention seen in pd patients with anxiety .\nit has also been suggested that hyperactivation within the putamen may reflect a compensatory striatal mechanism to maintain normal working memory performance in pd patients ; however , losing this compensatory activation has been shown to contribute to poor working memory performance .\nanxiety in mild pd has been linked to reduced putamen dopamine uptake which becomes more extensive as the disease progresses .\nthis further supports the notion that anxiety may disrupt compensatory striatal mechanisms as well , providing another possible explanation for the cognitive impairments observed in pd patients with anxiety in this study .\nnoradrenergic and serotonergic systems should also be considered when trying to explain the mechanisms by which anxiety may influence cognition in pd . although these neurotransmitter systems are relatively understudied in pd cognition , treating the noradrenergic and serotonergic systems has shown beneficial effects on cognition in pd .\nselective serotonin reuptake inhibitor , citalopram , was shown to improve response inhibition deficits in pd , while noradrenaline reuptake blocker , atomoxetine , has been recently reported to have promising effects on cognition in pd [ 45 , 46 ] .\noverall , very few neuroimaging studies have been conducted in pd in order to understand the neural correlates of pd anxiety and its underlying neural pathology .\nfuture research should focus on relating anatomical changes and neurochemical changes to neural activation in order to gain a clearer understanding on how these pathologies affect anxiety in pd . to further understand how anxiety and cognitive dysfunction are related ,\nfuture research should focus on using advanced structural and function imaging techniques to explain both cognitive and neural breakdowns that are associated with anxiety in pd patients .\nresearch has indicated that those with amnestic mild cognitive impairment who have more neuropsychiatric symptoms have a greater risk of developing dementia compared to those with fewer neuropsychiatric symptoms .\nfuture studies should also examine whether treating neuropsychiatric symptoms might impact the progression of cognitive decline and improve cognitive impairments in pd patients .\nprevious studies have used pd symptom laterality as a window to infer asymmetrical dysfunction of neural circuits .\nfor example , lpd patients have greater inferred right hemisphere pathology , whereas rpd patients have greater inferred left hemisphere pathology .\nthus , cognitive domains predominantly subserved by the left hemisphere ( e.g. , verbally mediated tasks of executive function and verbal memory ) might be hypothesized to be more affected in rpd than lpd ; however , this remains controversial .\nit has also been suggested that since anxiety is a common feature of left hemisphere involvement [ 48 , 49 ] , cognitive domains subserved by the left hemisphere may also be more strongly related to anxiety .\nresults from this study showed selective verbal memory deficits in rpd patients with anxiety compared to rpd without anxiety , whereas lpd patients with anxiety had greater attentional / working memory deficits compared to lpd without anxiety .\nalthough these results align with previous research , interpretations of these findings should be made with caution due to the small sample size in the lpd comparison specifically .\nrecent work has suggested that the hads questionnaire may underestimate the burden of anxiety related symptomology and therefore be a less sensitive measure of anxiety in pd [ 30 , 50 ] . in addition , our small sample size also limited the statistical power for detecting significant findings .\nbased on these limitations , our findings are likely conservative and underrepresent the true impact anxiety has on cognition in pd . additionally , the current study employed a very brief neuropsychological assessment including one or two tests for each cognitive domain .\nfuture studies are encouraged to collect a more complex and comprehensive battery from a larger sample of pd participants in order to better understand the role anxiety plays on cognition in pd .\nanother limitation of this study was the absence of diagnostic interviews to characterize participants ' psychiatric symptoms and specify the type of anxiety disorders included in this study .\nfuture studies should perform diagnostic interviews with participants ( e.g. , using dsm - v criteria ) rather than relying on self - reported measures to group participants , in order to better understand whether the type of anxiety disorder ( e.g. , social anxiety , phobias , panic disorders , and generalized anxiety ) influences cognitive performance differently in pd .\none advantage the hads questionnaire provided over other anxiety scales was that it assessed both anxiety and depression simultaneously and allowed us to control for coexisting depression .\nalthough there was a trend that the pda+ group self - reported higher levels of depression than the pda group , all participants included in the study scored < 6 on the depression subscale of the hads .\ncontrolling for depression while assessing anxiety has been identified as a key shortcoming in the majority of recent work .\nconsidering many previous studies have investigated the influence of depression on cognition in pd without accounting for the presence of anxiety and the inconsistent findings reported to date , we recommend that future research should try to disentangle the influence of anxiety versus depression on cognitive impairments in pd . considering the growing number of clinical trials for treating depression , there are few if any for the treatment of anxiety in pd .\nanxiety is a key contributor to decreased quality of life in pd and greatly requires better treatment options .\nmoreover , anxiety has been suggested to play a key role in freezing of gait ( fog ) , which is also related to attentional set - shifting [ 52 , 53 ] .\nfuture research should examine the link between anxiety , set - shifting , and fog , in order to determine whether treating anxiety might be a potential therapy for improving fog ."}

threatening conditions  ( rizk et al . , 1990 ) . among the serious manifestations of ohss are ascites and pleural effusion  ( rizk and smitz , 1992 ) .\nvascular endothelial growth factor has emerged as one of the factors most likely involved in the pathophysiology of ohss  ( geva and jaffe , 2000 ; rizk and aboulghar , 2010 ) .\nvascular endothelial growth factor is an angiogenic cytokine that is a potent stimulator of the vascular endothelium and appears to play an integral role in follicular growth , corpus luteum function and ovarian angiogenesis  ( rizk et al . , 1997 ) .\nvascular endothelial growth factor causes increased capillary permeability with its sequelae of ascites and possible pleural effusion  ( rizk et al . , 1997 ; gomez et al . , 2002 ) .\nhuman chorionic gonadotrophin is thought to play a crucial role in the development of ohss  ( rizk et al .\ntwo distinct forms of severe ohss have been described : early and late forms  ( papanikolaou et al . , 2005 ; mathur et al . , 2000 ) .\nearly ohss is caused by the administration of exogenous human chorionic gonadotrophin  ( hcg ) and it starts before the 10th day after oocyte retrieval , while the late form is the result of endogenous human chorionic gonadotrophin release in the event of pregnancy , and it starts after the 10th day following oocyte aspiration  ( papanikolaou et al . , 2005 ;\nsuch strategies included the use of low dose gonadotropins and frequent monitoring during controlled ovarian stimulation , cycle cancellation , coasting , freeze all embryos and the use of gonadotropin releasing hormone  ( gnrh ) agonist as an oocyte trigger in gnrh antagonist cycles  ( rizk et al .\nthe use of antagonist in the luteal phase with total freeze of embryos to prevent severe ohss has also been suggested  ( lainas et al . , 2012 ) .\nsuch strategies should be used especially in patients at high risk for developing severe ohss , including those who are young , have low body weight , have polycystic ovary syndrome , those who experience high estradiol levels , rapidly increasing estradiol levels , high number of follicles during controlled ovarian stimulation and those with high number of oocytes retrieved  ( rizk and aboulghar , 1999 ; delvigne , 2009 ) .\ndopamine agonists have been proposed for the prevention of ohss in women at high risk . however , the study by lvarez et al . \n( 2007 ) suggested that it was only effective in reducing the incidence of moderate ohss , but not in its severe form  ( alvarez et al . , 2007 ) .\nlow - dose aspirin therapy and doxycycline have also been suggested to inhibit angiogenesis  ( fainaru et al . , 2009 ) .\n( 2011 ) believes that the concept of an ohss - free clinic has become a reality .\nthe authors suggest that this approach should include pituitary down - regulation using a gnrh antagonist , ovulation triggering with a gnrh agonist and vitrification of oocytes or embryos  ( devroey et al . , 2011 ) .\nsevere and critical forms of ohss are associated with significant ascites  ( golan et al . , 1989 ; rizk et al . ,\nascites results in an increased abdominal pressure compromising venous return , cardiac output and renal perfusion  ( navot et al .\nparacentesis is frequently needed , as prompt drainage of fluid produces a significant clinical and biochemical improvement , including spontaneous diuresis and hastening the resolution process  ( rizk et al .\n, multiple paracenteses may be required to relieve symptoms and avoid serious sequelae of hemoconcentration , hypotension , decreased renal perfusion and severe respiratory compromise . instead of multiple interventions ,\nthe placement of a catheter temporarily for a few days will permit complete drainage through one procedure  ( rizk and aboulghar , 1999 ) .\npigtail catheters have been used for drainage in various clinical situations . in a previous study we described the use of percutaneous placement of a pigtail catheter for drainage of ascites caused by severe / critical ohss  ( abuzeid et al . , 2003 ) .\nin this study we established the efficacy and safety of pigtail catheter drainage in the management of severe / critical ohss in patients who underwent in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer at our centre between 1999 and 2001 on both inpatient and outpatient basis .\nthe aim of the current study was to evaluate the role of the pigtail catheter drainage in outpatient management of patients with early onset severe ohss .\nthis is a retrospective study that included all patients who underwent in vitro fertilization and developed severe or critical ohss by the golan classification  ( golan et al . , 1989 ) in the period between 2004 and 2009 .\nall patients underwent an ultrasound evaluation which documented the presence of severe ascites and bilateral ovarian enlargement .\nall patients presented with shortness of breath , marked abdominal distension , nausea , weight gain and lower abdominal pain .\nthirteen patients complained of vomiting , and 3 patients reported decreased urine output  ( less than 720 cc per 24  hours ) and had haemoglobin   15 g / dl .\nall 33 patients were offered treatment using pigtail catheter insertion as an alternative to trans - vaginal paracentesis .\nblood studies including a complete blood count , creatinine , electrolytes , serum albumin and total protein , and coagulation panel were ordered prior to the procedure .\nall 33  patients were rehydrated with intravenous crystalloid solutions  ( 0.9% normal saline ) .\ncare was taken to give the patient the same amount of fluid as the amount that was drained from the peritoneal cavity .  \nall pigtail catheter placements were performed in the operating room at our surgical centre . the catheter  ( 6 - 0 french , 2.0 mm , boston scientific , quincy , ma , usa ) was introduced utilizing a non - disposable metal gamete intra - fallopian treatment  ( gift ) trocar and cannula  ( embryon gift catheter , ivf online , gilford , ct , usa ) which was introduced into the largest accessible ascitic fluid pocket in the upper outer quadrant of the abdominal wall under local anaesthesia and trans - abdominal ultrasound guidance . the trocar was then removed and a glide wire  ( boston scientific corp . , watertown , ma , usa ) was threaded through the gift canula . the canula was removed with care so as to keep the glide wire in the peritoneal cavity .\nthe pigtail catheter was guided into the peritoneal cavity by the wire after removal of the stylet of the pigtail catheter .\nthe catheter was anchored to the skin using 2 - 0 silk suture and it was supported by gauze , which was covered by a tegaderm .\nthe catheter was connected to a three - way stop cock which was connected to a drainage bag .\ninitial amount of drained fluid was calculated and subsequently the patients were trained to drain 1000 cc per day  ( 500 cc in the morning and 500 cc in the evening ) .\none liter normal saline and 500 cc of 6% hydroxyethyle starch solution  ( hespan ) was administered to the patient on the same day of pigtail catheter placement .\nany patient with critical ohss according to the golan classification , or those in whom the presenting symptoms and signs did not completely subside after drainage of ascitic fluid and iv fluid replacement , were admitted to the hospital for observation and further management .\nall other patients were sent home . once there was minimal or no drainage from the catheter , the patient returned to the office for removal of the catheter .\nthe patients were encouraged to drink plenty of fluids and to increase their protein intake .\nall patients kept a diary for body weight , abdominal girth , and urine output before and after the procedure .\npatients were seen in the office as needed for evaluation and hydration with normal saline .\ndemographic data including mean age  ( years ) , duration of infertility  ( years ) , bmi  ( kg / m2 ) and aetiology of infertility are illustrated in table i. ovarian stimulation data including number of treatment days , total dose of recombinant follicle stimulating hormone , hormone serum levels , endometrial thickness , number of follicles and number of patients receiving only 5000 iu of human chorionic gonadotrophin is illustrated in table ii .\nour data include the number of patients requiring early versus late placement of pigtail catheter , mean amount of ascitic fluid drained immediately after pigtail placement , number of days of pigtail catheter drainage and the number of days between oocyte retrieval and the onset of severe ohss symptoms requiring pigtail placement .\ntable iii also illustrates the number of patients who underwent coasting , number of patients who received prophylactic hespan on day of egg retrieval .\nvalues are expressed as mean + standard deviation values are expressed as mean  +  standard deviation : rfsh  =  recombinant fsh ; hmg  = human menopausal gonadotropins ; hcg  =  human chorionic gonadotropin ; e2  =  estradiol values are expressed as mean + standard deviation three patients  ( 9% ) required an early placement of a pigtail catheter while 30 patients  ( 91% ) had late placement of the catheter  ( table iii ) .\ntwenty - nine patients  ( 88% ) were managed on an outpatient basis without any complications .\nfour patients  ( 12% ) required hospital admission for 1 - 7 days  ( 3 + 2.7 ) , three for associated severe pleural effusion requiring thoracentesis .\nthese three patients were admitted to the hospital immediately after insertion of the pigtail catheter for management of severe pleural effusion and careful observation .\none patient was admitted 48 hours after insertion of the pigtail catheter for work up for chest pain , all tests were negative .\nnavot et al . , 1992 ; rizk and aboulghar , 1999 ) , but perhaps the most accepted classification of ohss is the one described by golan et al as mild , moderate and severe  ( golan et al . , 1989 ) .\nhowever , clinicians should be aware that ohss is a dynamic condition and moderate ohss may progress to severe ohss within hours  ( rizk and aboulghar , 1999 ; rizk , 2009 ) .\ntherefore , the practice committee of the american society for reproductive medicine  ( asrm ) proposed a classification for ohss of mild , worsening and serious  ( the practice committee of the american society for reproductive medicine , 2008 ) . recognizing the patients at high - risk , prevention and early recognition are the most important steps in the management of ohss  ( rizk , 2006 ) .\nhowever , severe forms of ohss , especially late onset type that occurs when patients are pregnant , most likely will continue to happen , albeit at much lower rate , unless one reverts to a total freeze of all embryos after the use of gnrh agonist as a trigger shot in a gnrh antagonist cycle  ( donoso and devroey , 2013 ; devroey et al . , 2011 ) .\ntraditional treatment consists mainly of supportive management until spontaneous resolution occurs  ( rizk , 1994 ) .\nalthough moderate ohss does not usually require intervention , outpatient monitoring is essential to identify progression to a severe form  ( rizk , 2006 ) .\npatients with moderate ohss can be managed on an outpatient basis by adequate hydration and close daily monitoring of weight gain and abdominal girth to detect progression to severe ohss , and to provide intervention , if required  ( rizk , 2010 ) .\npatients presenting with severe forms of ohss are usually managed on inpatient basis and most patients with critical ohss are admitted to intensive care units for aggressive supportive measures to avoid maternal morbidity and mortality  ( the practice committee of the american society for reproductive medicine , 2008 ) .\ncorrection of hypovolemia , electrolyte imbalance and hypoalbuminemia are the basic principles during the treatment of severe ohss  ( rizk , 1994 , 2006 ; myrianthefs et al . , 2000 ) .\n( 1992 ) suggested that paracentesis is the single most important treatment modality in life - threatening ohss not controlled by medical therapy .\nparacentesis and removal of ascites result in relieving the pressure on the inferior vena cava and improvement in venous return , cardiac output and renal perfusion  ( padilla et al . , 1990 ) .\ntherefore , prompt drainage of fluid produces significant clinical and biochemical improvement , including spontaneous diuresis and hastening the resolution process  ( abuzeid et al .\n, 2003 ; the practice committee of the american society for reproductive medicine , 2008 ) .\nit is also possible that removal of ascites decreases the amount of vegf and its effects on vascular permeability .\ntherefore ultrasound guided drainage of the ascitic fluid should be performed in severe cases of ohss with respiratory distress , oliguria or severe abdominal pain  ( padilla et al . , 1990 ) .\nthis can be done either trans - vaginally  ( aboulghar et al . , 1990 ) or trans - abdominally  ( padilla et al . ,\n1990 ) . however , recurrence of ascites is common in severe cases of ohss .\nplacement of a pigtail catheter has been proposed by some investigators to allow drainage of ascitic fluid whenever it accumulates without the need for further surgical procedures  ( abuzeid et al . , 2003 ) .\nin a previous study we reported the use of percutaneous pigtail catheter for drainage of ascites in severe ohss as an alternative to repeated paracentesis  ( abuzeid et al . , 2003 ) .\nthis procedure is relatively simple and requires a short period of time as compared to the time needed to gradually aspirate any fluid accumulation transvaginally .\nimmediate relief of symptoms and signs of severe ohss after pigtail catheter insertion was an important finding .\nin addition , the ease by which any accumulated ascitic fluid was drained resulted in a faster resolution of ohss  ( abuzeid et al . ,\nno infection was reported  ( abuzeid et al . , 2003 ) . in that study the first 13 patients\nthey were discharged home with the pigtail catheter in place and managed on an outpatient basis until ohss subsided ; thereafter the catheter was removed .\nthe last 13 patients were managed on an outpatient basis without any problem  ( abuzeid mi , et al . , 2003 ) .\nour previous study confirmed the safety and effectiveness of the pigtail catheter for the management of severe ohss .\ntherefore , we embarked on the current study to evaluate the role of pigtail catheter drainage in outpatient management of patients with severe ohss syndrome . in the current study we demonstrated that patients who were diagnosed very early with severe ohss can be managed safely and effectively on outpatient basis using pigtail catheter drainage , iv fluid replacement and careful monitoring .\nalthough all 33 patients presented with shortness of breath , marked abdominal distension , nausea , weight gain and lower abdominal pain , and 13 of them complained of vomiting ,  ( all are criteria for hospital admission according to the practice committee of the american society for reproductive medicine on ohss ) , 30 patients were sent home as their presenting symptoms were relieved .\nearly diagnosis and intervention resulted in rapid elimination of the symptoms of severe ohss and normalization of vital signs , which allow us to manage the patients on outpatient basis .\nthe pigtail catheter placements were performed without complications and patients were discharged home after a few hours of observation .\nthe patients who needed hospital admission were those with associated severe pleural effusion requiring thoracentesis .\nanother patient was admitted to the hospital for 1 day for work up for chest pain and possible diagnosis of pulmonary embolism .\nonce pulmonary embolism was ruled out , she was discharged home with a pigtail catheter in place and she was managed on outpatient basis .\noutpatient management of ohss has no place in those who fail to have complete resolutions of their symptoms , or those with severe hyperproteinuria or electrolyte imbalance .\ncertainly it has no place in patients with critical ohss such as those with severe pleural effusion , diminished urine output , severe hemoconcentration and those at increased risk of thromboembolic risks  ( rizk , 2010 ) .\nit is imperative to stress that such a protocol can only be used in patients who are motivated , reliable and have the necessary support at home to allow them to return to the clinic or go to the emergency room if the need arises .\nit also requires dedicated in vitro fertilization nurses to educate and follow up the patient on a daily basis .\ncontrary to other reports that state that access to intravenous albumin is a critical part of outpatient management for severe ohss , we did not use any albumin replacement  ( lincoln et al . , 2002 ) .\nthe reason behind the use of intravenous albumin is to increase intravascular oncotic pressure , thereby curtailing the exodus of free water from the intravascular space . in our study\nwe used hespan instead of albumin , as some investigators have shown that it is beneficial in reducing the incidence of severe ohss  ( youssef et al . , 2011 ) . by increasing the intravascular oncotic pressure\nin addition , the majority of our patients had late onset ohss as a result of pregnancy .\nhespan should be used with caution in patients with late onset ohss only when benefits outweigh risks.it is a fact that outpatient management of early severe ohss is a common practice among infertility specialists after trans - vaginal aspiration of ascitic fluid and iv fluid hydration .\noutpatient management by repeated abdominal or trans - vaginal paracentesis has been reported to be safe , effective and cost effective  ( lincoln et al .\n, 2002 ; shrivastav et al . , 1994 ; fluker et al . , 2000\n( 1994 ) were the first to suggest that day care management in patients with severe ohss with abdominal paracentesis and iv hydration was simple , safe and effective compared with traditional treatment with in - patient hospitalization and supportive measures .\n( 2002 ) concluded that the need for hospitalization for hyperstimulated patients can be minimized by outpatient management of severe ohss with trans - vaginal culdocentesis and rehydration with crystalloids and albumin .\n( 2000 ) advocated in a pilot study an active management strategy for moderate ohss , which involved early paracentesis designed to minimize the progression from moderate to severe ohss , instead of late paracentesis aimed at speeding up recovery in severely ill patients .\n( 2010 ) concluded that early outpatient paracentesis for moderate to severe ohss is the most cost effective management plan when compared with traditional conservative inpatient therapy .\n( 2009 ) reported a large series of patients with severe ohss in whom the vast majority were successfully managed as outpatients with use of aggressive trans - vaginal paracentesis  ( smith et al . , 2009 ) . despite the findings in our study\nit is important to emphasize that ohss remains a serious disorder with the potential for rapid deterioration , requiring hospitalization and intensive treatment of a critically ill patient .\nthe life - threatening complications of ohss are secondary to thromboembolism or compromised pulmonary or cardiovascular function and multi - organ failure\n. there have been isolated reports of women dying from the complications associated with ohss .\nthe mortality rate related to ohss is very low and was estimated by brinsden et al . \nmore recently , reports regarding maternal mortality rates due to ohss in the netherlands and united kingdom demonstrate an incidence of approximately 3 deaths per 100,000 in ivf cycles  ( braat et al .\n, 2006 ; lewis , 2007 ) . eleven lethal complications of assisted reproductive technology have been documented and summarized by braat et al . \nseveral investigators reported sporadic fatality as a result of ohss due to adult respiratory distress syndrome , massive pulmonary oedema , myocardial infarction , and carotid artery occlusion resulting in cerebral infarction . in this study\nwe describe a modified technique of what interventional radiologists usually use for pigtail catheter placement .\nwe observed that in the obese patients the metal introducer provided in the pigtail catheter kit is difficult to use ; instead we used the non disposable gamete intra - fallopian treatment trocar and cannula to facilitate the introduction of the catheter through the abdominal wall of such patients .\nthis technique helps to manage the patients in the office without the need for sending her to the hospital for an interventional radiologist to place the catheter .\nhowever , the patients in this study were identified from our in vitro fertilization database ; the study included every patient who developed severe / critical ohss .\nin addition , the lack of a control group that was managed without pigtail catheter placement limits the conclusions that can be drawn from our study . in summary ,\ndrainage of ascitic fluid in patients with severe / critical ohss is an important step in the management of this condition  ( rizk , 2010 ) .\nthe placement of a pigtail catheter resulted in a safe and effective outpatient management of the majority of patients with severe ohss .\nhowever , outpatient management of this potentially fatal condition requires clear understanding that rapid deterioration may occur , which may necessitate hospitalization and intensive treatment of a critically ill patient  ( rizk , 2006 , 2010 ) .\npatients with critical ohss and those with persistence of symptoms of severe ohss despite insertion of a pigtail catheter and drainage of ascitic fluid should be admitted to the hospital for inpatient management ."}

dependent diabetes can be induced by multiple low doses of streptozotocin ( mlds ) ( 15 ) .\nthis model is a commonly used animal model that has many histological and clinical features similar to those of human type 1 diabetes and involves the participation of macrophages and t cells .\nstreptozotocin ( stz ) is a pancreatic  cell toxin that induces inflammation of the islets by immune cells when it is given in multiple low doses ( 16 ) .\nthis model of diabetes offers some advantages , such as simultaneous appearance of diabetes mellitus in all animals and not having immune abnormalities that may complicate studies in spontaneous diabetes in non - obese diabetic ( nod ) mice or bio breeding ( bb ) rats .\ntherefore , this model as a good model has been applied extensively to investigate the type 1 diabetes mellitus , especially study the immune pathways and modulations of autoimmune insulitis and  cell death ( 17 - 18 ) .\nc57bl/6 mice , also called  c57 black 6  or simply  black 6  has the advantage of strain stability and easy breeding .\nthe most common application of c57bl/6 mice is to serve as physiological or pathological models for in vivo experiments ( 19 ) . as such\n, mlds induced c57bl/6j mice were chosen to evaluate the anti - hyperglycemic activity of ptx and investigate the immunotherapeutic molecular mechanisms of how ptx attenuated the development of t1d .\nptx is commonly used for the treatment of microcirculatory disorders and yields only minimal side effects in patients .\nin addition , due to its varied immunomodulatory effects , ptx has been used in several autoimmune diseases including rheumatoid arthritis ( 20 ) , multiple sclerosis ( 21 ) , and systemic lupus erythematosus ( 22 ) .\ndrugs that increase the level of camp , including pde inhibitors , are known to prevent or attenuate inflammatory cell responses ( 20 ) .\nprevious studies have also shown that ptx lowers blood glucose levels in diabetic animals ( 23 ) , and the results from the present studies also indicated that ptx possessed an anti - hyperglycemic property .\nmore importantly , the present data demonstrated that ptx could increase serum insulin concentrations in type 1 diabetic mice .\nit has been shown that ptx could reduce ( but not abrogate ) the insulin requirements or lengthen the  honeymoon  ( non - insulin - requiring ) period in a study of 21 children with new - onset type 1diabetes ( 24 ) .\nt helper 1 cells produce proinflammatory cytokines ( tnf- , ifn -  , il-1 , il-6 , and il-12 ) , which activate macrophages and cytotoxic t cells to destroy -cells , whereas anti - inflammatory cytokines ( il-4 and il-10 ) that are produced by activated t helper 2 cells , prevent -cell destructive insulitis ( 25 ) .\nil-10 has been shown to prevent the onset of diabetes in mice ( 26 ) . in response to cytokine stimulation , -cells generate reactive oxygen species ( ross ) and reactive nitrogen species such as nitric oxide ( no ) , which facilitate their destruction ( 27 ) .\nno is also synthesized within cytokine - activated macrophages by inducible nitric oxide synthase ( inos ) ( 28 ) .\nmore recently , the role of il-17-producing t cells have been demonstrated in the development of several autoimmune diseases , including multiple sclerosis , rheumatoid arthritis and type 1 diabetes .\nil-17 is a proinflammatory cytokine that is detrimental to pancreatic islet cells ( 29 ) .\nil-17 promotes infiltration of neutrophils and macrophages , stimulates the production of other proinflammatory cytokines , including tnf- , il-1 , il-6 and il-12 , by activated macrophages and induces nitric oxide release from  cells that interferes with their function and cause -cell destruction ( 30 , 5 ) .\nit has been assumed that ptx similar to camp elevating agents , selectively suppresses the production of t helper type 1(il-2 , ifn -  ) , but not t helper type 2(il-4 , il-6 , il-10 ) cytokines ( 31 ) .\nhowever , it has also been demonstrated that the effect of ptx on cytokine production is cell - specific ( 32 ) .\nthe present study shows that ptx is not only able to inhibit the release of proinflammatory cytokines ( ifn -  and il-17 ) , but can also increase the production of anti - inflammatory cytokines ( il-10 ) . since ptx has been found to be able to inhibit the release of proinflammatory cytokines ( 33 ) , and favor th2 response ( 34 ) , it may indirectly interfere with the induction of inos .\nit has been shown that pde inhibitors elevate camp , prevent or attenuate inflammatory cell responses ( 35 ) and suppress proliferation of lymphocytes ( 36 ) .\nour findings are consistent with previous studies , showing that ptx treatment prevented lymphocyte proliferation .\nin summary , results of the present work demonstrated that the suppressive effect of the ptx treatment on t1d was accompanied by decreased blood glucose level , increased plasma insulin level , suppression of t cell proliferation , down - regulation of th1 and th17 cytokines ( ifn -  and il-17 ) and increase in the production of il-10 in supernatant of splenic culture of the treated mice .\nit seems that pentoxifylline treatment has a therapeutic effect against mlds - induced diabetes in mice ."}

in another study , they found a 76.1% prevalence in patients with severe refractory asthma and a 71.1% prevalence in patients with non - severe asthma . \n\n\n \nin one study , bachert et al . found a 38.1% prevalence of positivity for staphylococcal toxin - specific ige antibodies in patients with asthma ( independently of disease severity ) and a 62% prevalence in patients with severe asthma ; in another study , they found a 59.6% prevalence in patients with severe uncontrolled asthma and a 40.8% prevalence in patients with controlled asthma , \n\n\n  the latter prevalence being closer to that found in the present study .  \naureus , such as sinonasal polyposis , bronchiectasis , chronic bronchitis , and atopic dermatitis , were not included in the present study . by facilitating colonization or infection with s .\naureus , the aforementioned conditions can lead to increased quantities of staphylococcal toxins in the body , resulting in increased ige - mediated sensitization and , consequently , a heterogeneous population of asthma patients .\nthe studies conducted by kowalski et al . \n\n\n  and bachert et al . \n\n\n  had no such exclusion criteria and included patients with chronic sinus disease and sinonasal polyposis , as was the case with the most recent study by kowalski et al . , \n  who nevertheless found no statistically significant differences between asthma patients with polyposis and those without regarding their levels of staphylococcal toxin - specific ige antibodies .\nthis might explain the differences between our results and those obtained by the two aforementioned groups of authors regarding the degree of ige - mediated sensitization .\naureus in the brazilian population ; therefore , it is currently impossible to determine whether or not it is lower than that in the european population .\nit is also impossible to determine whether the allergic immune response to staphylococcal toxins is lower in asthma patients in brazil than in those in other countries .   in the present study\n, there were no statistically significant differences between the two groups regarding the frequency of staphylococcal toxin - specific ige antibodies .\nour results are qualitatively similar to but quantitatively different from those obtained by kowalski et al . , \n\n\n  who found significantly higher levels of staphylococcal toxin - specific ige antibodies in patients with severe asthma .\nin addition , our results are qualitatively and quantitatively different from those obtained by bachert et al . \n\n\n \nthese differences are also due to the exclusion criteria used in the present study , which were not used in any of the aforementioned studies , and to specific characteristics of our study population , as previously mentioned .   in the present study , ige antibodies to sea , seb , sec , and tsst\nwere found in 62 ( 43.7% ) of the 142 asthma patients analyzed , and neither the frequency of staphylococcal toxin - specific ige antibodies nor the serum levels of those antibodies were associated with the clinical severity of asthma .\nthese results are extremely relevant because this is the first study on this topic in latin america , the results of which differed from those of previous studies conducted in europe , indicating a \" negative \" association\n.   the limitations of the present study lie in the fact that it was a single - center study conducted at a tertiary care university hospital , in a single demographic area of brazil .\nour primary objective was to evaluate the influence of serum levels of staphylococcal toxin - specific ige antibodies and their association with asthma severity , meaning that this was not a population prevalence study of ige sensitization in asthma patients and healthy individuals in our region . if that had been the case , a much larger sample size would have been required , and it would have been impossible to obtain that in a single - center study .\ntherefore , in the present study , each group served as the control group for the other , without the use of a third group , comprising healthy individuals .  \nmulticenter studies in brazil and other latin american countries are needed in order to determine more accurately the role of ige - mediated sensitization to staphylococcal toxins as an aggravator of asthma , as well as to determine its prevalence in asthma patients and healthy individuals .\nsuch studies should include asthma patients with and without diseases that can lead to increased colonization or infection with s ."}

5 ] . nowadays ,\ncardiovascular diseases are among the most widespread chronic diseases in most countries . according to forecasts ,\nthe mortality rate in eastern mediterranean countries including iran will be 30 - 35% [ 6 , 7 ] . despite the emphasis on prevention and development of newtreatments , surgery is the only choice for many patients with cardiovascular disease .\none of the surgical procedures for the treatment of cardiovascular patients is coronary artery bypass surgery .\nin fact , heart surgery significantly influences on the quality of life of patients with cardiovascular diseases .\nhence , heart surgery is an important event in the lives of patients causing collapse of economic , professional and personal life . on the other hand , each surgical procedure\nis associated with several psychological complications for patients . of the most important complications are anxiety and depression so that approximately 65% of cardiovascular patients experience them after surgical and medical interventions .\nin fact , anxiety and depression complicate the treatment process [ 7 , 8 ] .\nsome scientists believe that anxiety is one of the essential elements of human life . however , acute and long - term anxiety is integral part of all psychological diseases . according to nemati and colleagues ,\nin fact , anxiety is a common psychological response of cardiovascular patients which is associated with reduced quality of life and psychological morbidity [ 11 , 12 ] . on the other hand ,\nanxiety causes increased heart rate and breathing as well as high blood pressure and even mortality .\nit is associated with increased risk of mortality , disability , increased medical care and functional impairment in daily activities [ 12 , 13 ] . clinical depression has been reported in 54% of patients after bypass surgery . according to world health organization ( who ) , depression is the fourth chronic disease where its disability is comparable with 8 major chronic disorders .\nthe outcome of depression in patients with cardiovascular disease is deterioration of physical and emotional state . given the incidence of such complications in patients with cardiovascular disease\nthe best practice in this area is appropriate communication with patient [ 13 , 15 ] .\ngood and effective communication is very valuable from the perspective of patients . in general , communication is a set of learning skills .\nin fact , poor communication is the cause of most problems in treatment of patients .\nin fact , communication at the bedside is a therapeutic and professional communication . in health professionals ,\ncommunication and communication skills play a very important role in satisfaction of patients and solving their problems .\nthis is more important , especially in patients with chronic diseases or those requiring long - term care .\nthe therapeutic communication is formed from the first encounter of the patient with the medical team [ 21 , 22 ] .\nhowever , studies have shown that the communication between patient and medical team is not efficient .\nthe health personnel don not have adequate communication skills . in fact , nursing and medical team spend very little time to communicate with patients .\naccordingly , patients are not often satisfied with received information as well as the level and method of communication .\nhence , to achieve best therapeutic results , special attention should be paid to communication [ 16 , 19 , 22 ] .\nsince nursing is a practical discipline based on professional knowledge , it is necessary to use knowledge infrastructure to develop new approaches in clinical practice .\ntheories proposed by nursing scientists can be useful in this area [ 16 , 19 , 23 ] . for this purpose\nthe nurse - patient communication is an essential element of this theory [ 21 , 24 ] . according to peplau theory ,\nthe purpose of nursing care is to achieve a common good nurse - patient communication . according to peplau ,\npeplau refers to the importance of therapeutic communication with patients and its important role in reducing anxiety [ 21 , 23 , 24 ] .\nin fact , this theory provides a framework for nurse - patient communication . following this framework\n, the nurse will be able to respond communication needs of patients through establishing a good therapeutic communication with the patient [ 16 , 19 , 23 ] .\nhospitalization and a complex surgery such as heart surgery is a stressful process leading to depression in patients .\nfurthermore , the need for security and psychological comfort is one of the basic needs of patients achieved through a proper structured therapeutic communication with low cost .\naccordingly , the objective of the present study is to examine the impact of peplau therapeutic communication model on anxiety and depression in patients who were candidate for coronary bypass surgery .\nthis is a clinical trial with pre / post testing scheme examined the impact of independent variable ( peplau therapeutic communication ) on the dependent variables ( anxiety and depression ) .\nthe population consisted of all patients who were candidates for coronary artery bypass referred to the research environment on non -

test scores by eliminating the effect of pre - test .\nadjusted mean anxiety scores suggest that anxiety in the intervention group was lower than the control group .\nin fact , the mean anxiety scores of patients in the intervention group in pre - test and post - test stages represent the independent role of peplau 's therapeutic communication model in reducing anxiety in the intervention group ( f=174.02 , p=0.000 ) .\nmoreover , the anxiety level in the intervention group two and four months after the intervention was decreased compared to the control group ( f=38.37 , p=0.000 ; f=11.58 , p=0.000 ) ( table 3 ) . as shown in table 4 , the mean depression in the intervention group was reduced after the surgery . the mean postoperative depression in the control group was increased .\nin fact , the hospital depression in the intervention group was reduced after the therapeutic communication .\nthis indicates that the role of peplau 's therapeutic communication model in reducing hospital depression .\nanalysis of covariance was used to determine the effect of peplau 's therapeutic communication on depression level of the subjects . since\nhospital depression scale was used to measure depression , analysis of variance was performed using hospital depression scores .\nthe results showed significant differences between experimental and control groups in terms of depression level immediately after surgery , two and four months after surgery after adjustment for post - test scores by eliminating the effect of pre - test .\nadjusted mean depression scores suggest that anxiety in the intervention group was lower than the control group .\nin fact , the mean depression scores of patients in the intervention group in pre - test and post - test indicate the independent role of peplau 's therapeutic communication model in reducing depression in the intervention group ( f=163.27 , p=0.000 ) . such a difference is not observed in the control group .\nmoreover , the depression level in the intervention group four months after the intervention was decreased compared to the control group ( f=20.58 , p=0.000 ) . however , no significant difference was found between two groups in terms of hospital depression two months after intervention ( p=0.61 ) ( table 5 ) .\naccording to the results , peplau 's therapeutic communication is effective in reducing anxiety and depression in patients who were candidate for coronary artery bypass .\nit resulted in a dramatic decrease in anxiety and depression scores in the intervention group .\ndepression and anxiety are the most important preventive factors in cardiovascular diseases   causing disease rejection by the patient and reduce the incentive to treat and increase the likelihood of disease recurrence [ 25 - 27 ] .\nmost patients with coronary heart disease who survive after surgery resume their normal life after several weeks or several months .\nprevious studies show that patients suffer from anxiety and depression several months and sometimes several years after the surgery [ 26 , 27 , 29 ] .\ntherefore , follow - up and strategies to deal with postoperative psychological complications are of utmost importance .\nit is not possible except through establishing a coherent and targeted therapeutic communication . indeed , effective communication enables the medical team to identify patients needs and take steps to solve problems and meet their needs . according to dadashi , hosseini and moghaddam ( 2009 ) , staff had close encounters with patients in 85.5% of cases .\naccording to mastaneh and mouseli ( 2013 ) , the rate of respecting patient rights in terms of communication was 60% indicating a moderate level of communication skills . on the other hand , duration and how to communicate with patients , particularly in dealing with patients with chronic diseases are essential in the hope and positive attitude to treatment and follow - up after discharge [ 29 - 31 ] .\nin fact , the patient gains motivation to cope with illness and trust in nurses through proper therapeutic communication , because the care of patients with either physical or mental illness requires correct and consistent communication [ 30 , 31 ] .\ntherefore , implementing a communication pattern will help medical team to establish a proper communication .\npeplau 's model is one of these communication patterns . to communicate with patients , especially patients with chronic diseases ,\npeplau 's described four stages and defined roles for the nurse at every step as someone who is in close relationship with the patient [ 16 , 23 ] .\npeplau 's communication model helps nurses and patient to identify the disease , concerns and questions of the patient . through defining different roles for the nurse\nthis model refers to nursing skills and abilities to establish a simple convenient therapeutic communication .\nthe model enables nurses help the patient after discharge and to spend more time with patient [ 16 , 23 , 24 ] .\nfor example , it has been used in communicating with cancer patients and solving systematic problems of families [ 32 , 33 ] . in this study ,\npeplau 's communication models were employed as communication sessions for patients who were candidates for coronary artery bypass through applying nursing roles .\nthe results showed that holding communication meetings with patients immediately after surgery dramatically reduced hospital anxiety and depression .\naccordingly , to improve the nurse - patient communication and establish more effective therapeutic communication processes which improves clinical basis and can have a positive impact on the treatment and discharge processes and rehabilitation of patients , especially in patients with chronic diseases , training courses should be included in in -

binding sites , i.e. , the s189n change within antibody - binding site b ( 4,5 ) and the v226i and s227p changes residing in antibody - binding site d ( 4,5 ) . because of rotational restrictions , a proline substitution at position 227 ( s227p ) would typically give rise to considerable conformation change ; however , this particular substitution is located within a  barrel motif and therefore has little effect on regional protein conformation . cumulatively , field isolates characterized subsequent to this outbreak continue to exhibit these 4 changes , and they appear to constitute a distinct branch in the phylogeny of ha sequences when compared with h3n2 isolates from the 20032004 season .\n. this change may affect protein - protein interactions since it is immediately adjacent to antibody - binding site a , where neutralizing antibodies have been shown to bind ( 4,5 ) .\nfurthermore , since the k145n substitution is located within a glycosylation site , the charge alteration may affect glycosyl transferase activity , which results in altered glycosylation .\ndifferences in glycosylation have been shown to contribute to antigenic variation by preventing antibody binding to antigenic sites ( 15 ) .\nadditionally , 3-dimensional analysis suggests this amino acid substitution may also promote enhanced receptor binding since the asparagine r group is shorter , which may make binding requirements less stringent and the receptor cleft more accessible .\nthe 3-dimensional depiction provides a unique regional residue perspective , demonstrating how the rapidly evolving ha surface antigens in the vaccine strain differ at the molecular level .\ncollectively , the clinical isolates obtained from this outbreak in nepal can not be considered antigenically distinct from the a / wyoming/3/03 vaccine strain because only 4 of 9 isolates evaluated exhibited 4-fold lower titers by hi ( table 1 ) .\nfurthermore , the varying reactivity noted in several isolates from this outbreak having identical ha1 sequences is suggestive that other viral antigens aside from the ha1 protein may have contributed to the antigenic variability observed in the hi panel . with the exception of a / nepal/1670/2004 and a / nepal/1672/2004 , all isolates evaluated by hi ( table 1 ) exhibited identical ha1 amino acid sequences and varying antigenicity profiles to a / wyoming/03/2003 reference antisera .\none explanation for this observation is that genetic differences in other influenza surface proteins contribute to the observed immunoreactivity .\nalternative viral surface protein candidates include the neuraminidase , ha2 , and m2 glycoproteins , which have been shown to exhibit antigenic properties ( 1619 ) . in this report\n, we describe the genetic analysis of the ha proteins from viruses obtained from an early season outbreak and compare them to current vaccine strains .\nthree amino acids changes ( s189n , i226v , and s227p ) were noted in known ( 4,5 ) antibody - binding sites ( table 2 ) . the fourth change ( k145n ) , which was located within a glycosylation site , may enhance viral binding since the smaller asparagine r group is located close to the ha receptor - binding cleft ( figure 3 ) .\nphylogenetic analyses show that the nepal isolates make up a distinct branch in the evolution of h3n2 viruses when they are compared with vaccine and reference strains ( figure 2 ) . however , antigenic data appear more ambiguous , suggesting a multigenic effect that can not solely be attributed to properties of the influenza ha ( table 1 ) .\nstudies are in progress to characterize the neuraminidase , m2 , and ha2 proteins to determine the molecular basis responsible for antigenicity differences observed within isolates from this outbreak .\nthe k145n substitution change has become a marker for an increasingly large subset of the fujian - like viruses .\ncdc and the us department of defense have recently characterized viruses with the k145n change in singapore , taiwan , china , australia , canada , and the united states . in february 2005 , who reported the emergence of a new influenza h3n2 strain in the united states .\nthe a / california/7/2004 strain , which was first identified in the united states in september 2004 , contains all 4 changes observed in isolates from this nepalese outbreak .\nthe a / california/7/2004 strain differs by only 1 amino acid in ha1 ( which is of no immunologic importance ) from most isolates from the outbreak in nepal .\nall viruses characterized ( 150 globally isolated strains ) subsequent to the preparation of this report ( march 2005 ) by the us department of defense are genetically similar in amino acid sequence to these nepalese strains ( and the a / california strain ) .\nmost of the isolates ( 80% ) analyzed by cdc since october 2004 are antigenically related to a / california ( 20 ) , which indicates that this strain has emerged as the dominant influenza a h3n2 strain .\nthese data indicate that these viruses may persist as the dominant strain at the onset of the 20052006 influenza season . in february 2005 , who recommended inclusion of an a / california/7/2004-like strain in the 20052006 trivalent influenza vaccine to afford immunologic protection from this variant h3n2 virus .\nour findings emphasize the importance of continued molecular surveillance for characterizing emerging influenza drift variants ."}

income country undergoing rapid economic growth , increasing obesity , and with life expectancy recently increasing to levels similar to that of the us and england  allows for investigation of the biological risk associated with obesity in a population characterized by very different cultural , behavioral , socioeconomic , and dietary parameters .\nwe examine how elevated weight and obesity ( using an indicator that considers both bmi and waist circumference ) relate to having levels defined as clinical risk for cardiovascular , metabolic , and inflammatory markers in three aging societies that are now relatively similar in life expectancy but that differ in the timing of the epidemiological transition and obesity epidemic , history of economic development , socioeconomic levels , general lifestyle habits , health behaviors , and health care systems : the us , england , and taiwan .\nfinding differences in the relationship between obesity and indicators of physiological dysregulation in these three aging societies will clarify whether increases in weight gain are equally problematic across all countries .\nwe use data from three nationally representative samples : the us national health and nutrition examination survey ( nhanes , 20032006 ; n = 3855 ) , the english longitudinal study of ageing ( elsa , 2004 - 2005 ; n = 9139 ) , and the social environment and biomarkers of aging study ( sebas ) in taiwan ( 2000 ; n = 1023 ) .\nthese surveys collect information on demographics , as well as anthropometric , physical , and biological measures .\nevery year , approximately 5,000 individuals undergo detailed interviews and medical examinations , which include collection of several physiological measures .\nnhanes utilizes a complex sampling design , and when weights are applied , the sample is representative of the noninstitutionalized american population .\nwe use the 20032006 data since nhanes data is released in two - year intervals , and this sample is centered on 2004 - 2005 , which matches the period in which elsa was collected .\nfor nhanes , we use individual - level data based on a sample of 1,513 fasting individuals aged 54 and older .\nelsa includes participants drawn from households responding to the health survey for england ( hse ) in 1998 , 1999 , and 2001   and is representative of the english population aged 50 and older .\nthe core elsa sample ( wave 1 : 2002 - 2003 ) includes people living in an hse responding household who were born prior to march 1 , 1952 , and their partners who could be under age 50 . wave 4 of elsa ( 2008 - 2009 ) , which includes a nurse visit , includes wave 1 core members , if they are still alive and do not refuse further contact after the first interview at wave 1 .\nit also includes a refresher sample to maintain the age structure of the sample ( in waves 3 and 4 ) , and their partners . for elsa , we use individual - level data based on a sample of 7,384 individuals aged 54 and older .\nsebas is drawn from a follow - up survey of the survey of health and living status of the near elderly and elderly in taiwan ( also known as the taiwan longitudinal study of aging ( tlsa ) ) , a nationally representative survey of taiwanese adults ( including institutionalized individuals ) collected in 1989 , 1993 , 1996 , 1999 , and 2000 . in 2000 , a subsample of individuals was randomly selected for inclusion in sebas .\nsebas consists of adults aged 54 and older in 2000 , with in - home interviews and medical exams taken in a hospital . for sebas ,\nthe sample averages 66.8 years of age in england , and the us and taiwan mean age is about the same ( table 1 ) .\nthere are more men in taiwan ( 56% ) and england ( 53% ) and fewer in the us ( 44% ) .  \nwe examine the following indicators of physiological dysregulation often associated with obesity and also associated with increased risk for multiple adverse health outcomes and obesity [ 43 , 44 ] : ( 1 ) cardiovascular markers : high systolic ( sbp ) and diastolic blood pressure ( dbp ) ; ( 2 ) metabolic markers : high levels of blood lipids ( total and low - density lipoprotein ( ldl ) cholesterol , and fasting triglycerides ) , low levels of high - density lipoprotein ( hdl ) cholesterol , and high fasting glucose and glycated hemoglobin ; ( 3 ) high levels of inflammatory markers c - reactive protein ( crp ; available in nhanes and elsa ) and interleukin-6 ( il-6 ; available in sebas ) , as crp and il-6 have been positively associated with bmi . for each indicator\nwe use clinical cutpoints or widely used research - based cutpoints to indicate high levels of risk which are shown in table 1 [ 39 , 43 , 45 ] .\nthere has been debate as to the best indicator of obesity : body mass index ( bmi ) or waist circumference .\nwaist circumference is thought to be a better measure of abdominal adiposity than bmi and a better indicator of risk of poor health outcomes , including all - cause and cardiovascular mortality [ 46 , 47 ] . for this reason\nwe investigate the association between bmi and biomarkers across categories of bmi ( underweight < 18.5  kg / m , normal and overweight 18.529.9  kg / m , obese 3034.9  kg / m , and very obese 35  kg / m ) and waist circumference categorized as normal or high waist ( high waist : men 120  cm , women 88  cm ) . we create a composite measure of obesity and adiposity by categorizing individuals into five groups : ( 1 ) underweight and normal waist ( all underweight individuals had a normal waist circumference ) , ( 2 ) normal / overweight bmi ( termed normal bmi ) and normal waist circumference ( reference group ) , ( 3 ) normal / overweight bmi ( termed normal bmi ) and high waist circumference ( termed high waist ) , ( 4 ) obese and high waist ( all obese individuals had a high waist circumference ) , and ( 5 ) very obese .\nwe also evaluate an alternate definition for obesity in taiwan based on bmi 27 , as it has been suggested by some that obesity levels should be differentially defined for asians [ 48 , 49 ] .\na similar composite measure of obesity and adiposity was calculated using this alternate definition of bmi in taiwan . because these risk factors are all assumed to be associated with obesity and because dysregulation in multiple physiological systems has been shown to predict many of the poor health risk outcomes associated with aging , we also create two summary measures of risk based on the total number of at - risk levels of biomarkers , either 9 or 8 . because crp values for sebas are not available , this measure\nis not included in the 9-item summary measure for taiwan , but a summary measure ( range 09 ) was calculated for taiwan using il-6 , another indicator of inflammation , instead of the crp values included for the us and england . a second alternate summary measure of biological risk , excluding the inflammatory marker ( range 08 ) ,\nbiological risk summary scores were computed for individuals who had missing values on no more than 3 biological markers .\nwe examine multiple covariates in our investigation of the relationship between obesity and biological risk .\nself - reported use of antihypertensives was determined in all three countries , and use of lipid - lowering statins was only asked in the us sample .\ndichotomous variables were created to indicate whether the respondent reported being a current smoker and participating in at least moderate physical activity for exercise ( e.g. , brisk walking , running , or swimming ) in the past 30 days ( for the us and england ) or generally exercising once a week ( for taiwan ) .  \nwe use logistic regression models to determine the odds of having at - risk levels of a specific biomarker for obese men and women among the three populations . for all countries ,\nthe comparison group for bmi and waist circumference is the normal bmi and normal waist group .\nthe regressions included indicators of age , use of antihypertensives , current smoking status , and having exercised in the past 30 days .\nordinary least squares ( ols ) regression models were used to determine the relationship between the summary measures of biological risk and the composite measure of obesity and adiposity .\nwe begin by examining national differences in the high risk levels of individual biomarkers ( table 1 ) .\nlow levels  or high risk levels  of hdl cholesterol are also more common in taiwan .\nhigh total and ldl cholesterol is more common among the english ; lower levels of plasma glucose , crp , and glycated hemoglobin are also characteristic of the english .\nfew adults in england have elevated levels of fasting glucose ( 2.2% ) , while this is observed in 17.3% and 13.2% of american and taiwanese adults . \n\nmost people in this age range are in the normal to overweight category ( 64.7% , 67.2% , and 89.4% in the us , england , and taiwan , respectively ) ( table 2(a ) ) .\namericans are more likely to be obese ( 33.7% ) compared to the english ( 32.1% ) and taiwanese ( 7.2% ) . among the obese , americans are much more likely to be very obese : 13.4% of the total us sample , 10.1% in england , and about 1% in taiwan .\nboth among the obese and very obese , the average bmi is higher in the us and england compared to taiwan .\nfew are underweight in any country ( 1.7% , 0.8% , and 3.4% in the us , england , and taiwan , resp . ) .  \nwhen we examine waist circumference , the us has the highest average waist circumference , with 65.5% of americans , 55.9% of english , and 15.8% of taiwanese having a high waist size ( table 2(a ) ) .\nthis means that high waist characterizes a substantial number of those who would be categorized as normal weight in the us and england . among those in the normal and overweight group about half ( 49.5% ) of americans and a third ( 36.4% ) of the english\nalmost all obese individuals have a high waist in the us and england ( 98.3% in the us and 96.5% in england ) , but only 78.4% of the obese in taiwan also have a high waist . when we use the alternate obese cutpoint of 27  kg / m in taiwan , less than half of the obese individuals have a high waist ( not shown here ) . \n\namericans exhibit the highest proportion of the older population taking antihypertensive medication ( 47.1% ) ( table 1 ) .\nthe percentage who reports taking antihypertensives is lower in england ( 32.0% ) and taiwan ( 28.6% ) .\namericans are more likely to be current smokers ( 24.5% ) than persons in taiwan ( 22.5% ) and england ( 13.9% ) .\nmore than half of the population in all countries report having exercised in the past 30 days , with more english exercising ( 82.2% ) compared to taiwan ( 61.4% ) and the us ( 58.5% ) . \n\nmen with normal bmi and high waist have a greater likelihood than men with normal bmi and normal waist size of having high - risk levels of triglycerides in all three countries . in the us and england ,\nmen with high waist are more likely to have high levels of glycosylated hemoglobin and higher crp ; fasting glucose is also elevated among this group in the us ( table 3(a ) ) .\nmen who are obese in the us have fewer elevated risk factors than those with high waist who are not obese ; in the us , obese men are only more likely than normal weight men without high waist to have elevated glycated hemoglobin , fasting glucose and crp .\nenglish men who are obese have more elevated risk : both blood pressure indicators , hdl cholesterol , triglycerides , glycated hemoglobin , and crp .\nvery obese men in england have the same elevated risk factors with the exception of dbp .\nvery obese men in the us are more likely to have elevated fasting glucose in addition to crp and glycated hemoglobin .\nenglish and taiwanese women with normal weight and high waist are more likely to have elevated sbp , dbp , and glycosylated hemoglobin ; only british women with higher waist have significantly elevated triglycerides and only the taiwanese women had more hdl risk .\nhigh risk crp is more common among both american and english women with normal bmi and high waist , and this risk of elevated crp is also higher in the obese and very obese ( table 3(b ) ) .\nobese women in britain had elevations in the same markers as normal bmi and high waist english women , while obese women in the us only have elevated fasting glucose , glycated hemoglobin , and crp ; obese women in taiwan only had high dbp . with the exception of taiwan , levels of the inflammatory markers ( crp in the us and england ; il-6 in taiwan ) are more likely to be elevated among persons with a high waist and normal bmi , obese or very obese , compared to their normal bmi and normal waist counterparts . among men ,\nan increase in the biological risk summary score ( range 09 ) is associated with having a high waist relative to being of normal bmi and normal waist in all three countries ( table 4(a ) ) .\nbeing obese or very obese is also related to a higher biological risk summary score ( 09 ) for men in the us and england .\nthese equations explain 6 to 11 percent of the variance in the summary indicator of biological risk .\nthese relationships are similar for women ( table 4(b ) ) , with one exception : obese taiwanese women do not have a significantly increased biological risk compared to their normal weight and normal waist counterparts .\nwhen we consider the alternate summary score that excludes our indicators of inflammation ( range 08 ) , being obese or very obese is no longer associated with a higher biological risk summary score in us men compared to men with a normal bmi and normal waist when controls for health behaviors and medication use are included ( table 5(a ) ) .\nthe size of the effects of the obesity categories is reduced on the 8-indicator summary measure in both england and the us , indicating the strong link between crp and obesity .\nthe r is also reduced in these equations for england and the us . for taiwan ,\nwomen in england and taiwan , but not women in the us , with a higher waist but who are not obese have significantly higher physiological dysregulation compared to their normal bmi and normal waist counterparts .\nobese women in all three countries have elevated risk and the very obese have even higher risk ( table 5(b ) ) . the alternate biological risk summary measure ( 08 )\nyields different relationships between weight and physiological dysregulation in the us and taiwan . in the us ,\nonly very obese women have a higher alternate biological risk summary score ( 08 ) . in taiwan , obese and normal bmi and high waist women exhibit higher alternate biological risk summary scores compared to their normal bmi and normal waist counterparts , except when smoking status , physical activity , and use of hypertensives are included .   figures 1(a ) and 1(b ) illustrate the predicted alternate biological risk score ( 08 ) for each weight category for men and women ( respectively ) aged 65 who are nonsmokers , do not engage in physical activity , and are currently taking antihypertensive medication .\nthis figure allows for country comparisons of individuals with these characteristics within each weight category and across weight categories .\nthe predicted values indicate that the us has the highest biological risk score within each respective weight category among men and women of the same age and lifestyle behaviors . with the exception of women in the normal bmi and high waist group ,\nengland has the second highest biological risk score within each weight category , followed by taiwan . among 65-year - old women with the noted lifestyle behaviors and with a normal bmi and high waist\nwhen we consider the alternate bmi cutpoint for obesity in taiwan ( bmi  27  kg / m ) , our findings for the individual biomarkers and summary measures of biological risk are similar to using the bmi  30  kg / m cutoff for taiwan except that the category normal weight with high waist no longer differs from the omitted category ( results not shown ) .\nthis study observes three general findings about how biological risk is associated with obesity in three countries that differ in lifestyle and culture .\nfirst , obesity is associated with physiological dysregulation in all countries with differences in the links between specific indicators of biological risk and obesity .\ngenerally , obesity in england is associated with hypertension , dyslipidemia , and elevated glycated hemoglobin ; americans who are obese are not more likely to have hypertension . in taiwan ,\nobese women are more likely to have elevated dbp and obese men have an increased risk of elevated triglycerides and glycated hemoglobin compared to their nonobese , normal waist counterparts .\nour biological risk summary scores indicate that at all levels of weight physiological dysregulation was highest in the us , followed by england ( with one exception ) , with taiwanese exhibiting the lowest biological risk in all groups among the three countries .\nsecond , these relationships remain after controlling for demographic factors , participation in physical activity , and other behavioral factors .\nthird , similar to obese older adults , high waist individuals with normal bmi also exhibit greater physiological dysregulation in all countries compared to their normal bmi and normal waist counterparts .\nour finding of a higher physiological dysregulation , as shown by the alternate biological risk summary score , in taiwan compared to the us and england could be due to a couple of potential explanations .\nthe prevalence of obesity in the us and england is much higher than in taiwan , indicating an earlier initial rise in obesity relative to taiwan . from 1978 to 2002 , the proportion of obese americans and britons exhibited stark increases ( 1332% and 623% for men and women , resp . ) .\nthe estimates for obesity prevalence in taiwan indicate a recent increase for men but not women . from 19931996 to 2000 - 2001 , the age - adjusted prevalence of obesity rose from 10.5% to 15.9% for men and declined from 13.2% to 10.7% in women .\nit may be that the lower levels of risk among older adults who have lived longer years with obesity could be a reflection of better pharmacologic control of physiological dysregulation ( e.g. , through statin use ) , which may in turn confer less biological risk in these populations compared to populations of currently obese taiwanese adults who may have more recently begun living with obesity .\na second reason for the observed country differences in obesity may be due to differences in dietary habits and lifestyle .\nthe us and england are two modern , western populations whose diets have been influenced by increased industrialization and have over time come to be characterized by high glycemic loads and high fatty acid composition .\ntaiwan , on the other hand , represents a country that has experienced the effects of the industrial and scientific revolutions later than that of the us and england but is currently rapidly undergoing economic development and demographic change .\nthe recent economic changes in taiwan may indicate that obese older adults in taiwan have more recently begun to consume high - fat diets , which could result in greater initial physiological dysregulation associated with access to western - influenced dietary habits . despite controlling for lifestyle behaviors thought to be linked with health , the country differences in obesity and physiological regulation remain .\nmoreover , the consideration of antihypertensives does not alter our substantive conclusions on these associations .\nthis suggests that despite the greater use of medications to treat hypertension in the us , obesity among americans is associated with greater overall biological risk than the other two countries .\nthis is supported by findings from the general population of americans relative to england , which report that the us is faced with greater health disadvantages than england in adulthood   and across the life span .\nwe also note differences in biological profiles of obese individuals between the two westernized countries : the us and england . the excess risk of hypertension associated with obesity in england was not found in the us .\nthese differences may be due to the higher use of medications among americans compared to the english , with about 16% more men and 18% more women in the us aged 65 + taking antihypertensive medication compared to their british counterparts .\nthe greater use of hypertensive medications in the us is also noted when compared to japan and countries across europe .  \ntwo notable differences in country patterns of the relationship between obesity and physiological dysregulation by sex are found . among men in england and taiwan ,\nthe order of magnitude of physiological dysregulation increases with higher weight categories ; however , this is not observed for us men .\nthis difference may be due to our inability to consider statin use in england and taiwan , which may be particularly important in the relationship between obesity and physiological dysregulation for men .\nconversely , the importance of considering statin use may be less vital to understanding the country differences in the association between obesity and physiological dysregulation among women , given that the relationship for women is more consistent across countries , namely in the us and england .\nwomen , underweight corresponds with higher biological risk ( though nonsignificant ) compared to women with normal bmi and normal waist .\nunderweight among men in taiwan is significantly associated with much lower biological risk than their normal bmi and normal weight counterparts .\nfurther studies will be required to explore possible explanations for these differences in physiological dysregulation .\nthe higher biological risk observed among normal bmi and high waist individuals relative to normal bmi and normal waist older adults builds upon previous studies that report on alternate indicators of body shape , which vary across countries .\nthe importance of waist circumference is underscored by our current study , as well as a growing body of literature on the predictive value of waist circumference on indicators of health .\nhigher rates of diabetes among older americans compared to britons have been accounted for by high waist circumference as opposed to bmi differences . additionally , increasing waist circumference is more predictive of greater risk of incident diabetes than bmi in middle - aged british men ( and the european prospective investigation into cancer and nutrition ( epic)-potsdam study ) .\nwaist circumference , as an indicator of central fat mass , is thought to be more strongly associated with disease risk , and in our case with physiological dysregulation , compared to bmi , which is considered a cruder index of adiposity .\nbanks and colleagues   cite differences in physical activity , diet and greater psychosocial environmental challenges in america compared to england as potential mechanisms linking central adiposity and type 2 diabetes .\nour study considers some of these possible mechanisms ( e.g. , physical activity and antihypertensive use ) but finds that they explain little of the relationship between biological risk and adiposity among the three countries .\ntogether , these results highlight the importance of considering waist circumference in investigating the links between indicators of health and adiposity .\nour finding of the biological risks associated with obesity among older taiwanese adults underscores the growing concern for risks associated with obesity in countries rapidly undergoing modernization . in comparing the biological risk of obese individuals among the three countries , we are able to use these international comparisons to our advantage to examine how differences in modernization influence the health of older adults in different populations\nthis may have potential health policy implications that underscore the importance of addressing and controlling the rising obesity epidemic that has become most widespread in countries , like the us and england , that have long experienced high economic growth and in countries currently undergoing rapid economic development .\nthe increasing use of biological information to inform our understanding of health represents an innovative method in biodemography that will further contribute to the testing of current comparative theory and the potential creation of new paradigms surrounding the influence of modernization on health .\nfirst is the use of a broad range of biological markers across three large - scale population surveys . the inclusion of biological information as objective precursors of health allows , to some extent , a fairly comparable comparison of indicators of health across the different populations .\nan exception to this uniform comparison of biomarkers across the three surveys is our use of inflammatory marker crp in the us and england and our inclusion of a different marker of inflammation ( il-6 ) in taiwan . of note , crp seems to be more strongly associated with obesity than il-6 .\na growing body of literature has made distinctions between bmi and waist circumference , namely , suggesting that waist circumference is a better indicator of abdominal obesity , which in turn has been associated with obesity - related health risks .\nour findings generally report a similar association between increased biological risk and ( 1 ) normal bmi and high waist and ( 2 ) obese and high waist .\nusing the us nhanes ,   reported that when both waist circumference and bmi were included in their analyses , only waist circumference was a significant predictor of comorbidity . although this and other studies have suggested that waist circumference may be a better indicator of obesity and risk for adverse health outcomes , our study finds the two indicators to be similarly associated with biological risk across the three countries .\nfirst , we examine population - based data from three countries at a single time point .\nfuture studies of longitudinal data will allow for further investigations of the potential role of obesity on biological risk observed in the current associations .\nsecond , we do not have measures of some lifestyle and medical behaviors for some of the datasets ( e.g. , statin use ) , which likely influence the relationship between obesity and biological risk .\nas such , we are unable to include such factors in our analyses of all three countries .\nit is possible that these lifestyle behaviors are key explanatory factors to the noted cross - country differences in obesity - related biological risk .\nthe cross - country differences in the relationship between increased biological risk for individuals who are obese and have a high waist underscore potential differences in health and lifestyle behaviors .\nthese behaviors may be a result of country differences in economic development that we are not able to observe in this study .\nthe country differences in the links between obesity and physiological dysregulation are particularly marked when comparing obesity among taiwanese older adults relative to westernized populations , such as the us and england .\nfurther examination of these relationships over time and across other countries will contribute to our understanding of the potential factors responsible for these country - specific variations in biological risk , as obesity becomes increasingly more prevalent and older adults in various countries live more years with obesity and increased adiposity ."}

up visits .\nnerve root injuries ( n=2 ) were encountered while trying to do a medial facetectomy to open the recess by a kerrison rongeur causing severe laceration of nerve root . however , nerve root was in continuity .\n, patties were used for gentle retraction and procedure of discectomy was successfully completed endoscopically without resorting to open discectomy .\n276 patients were able to return to sedentary work with an average delay of 2 weeks , except 24 patients who had complains of backache , occasional leg discomfort , discitis , and nerve root injuries .\nmedial facetectomy was resorted to in 59 patients to open the recess to decompress the nerve root in addition to discectomy .\nmixter and barr7 discovered the pathophysiology of discogenic sciatica and suggested laminectomy and discectomy as operative treatment .\nthe overall results of standard discectomy range from 68 to 95% in different series.8 the operative microscope and microsurgical techniques were developed in mid-1960 's by yasargil and krayenbuhl910 and these techniques revolutionized spine surgery leading to smaller incisions , less blood loss , increased visualization of site of pathology , decreased hospitalization , shorter postoperative recovery , and earlier return to activities compared with previous operative interventional techniques .\nthe results of microdiscectomy also range from 85 to 98%.1113 katayama et al.14 compared the results of open vs gold standard microdiscectomy and observed no difference between the surgical outcomes in both the groups but microdiscectomy gave better lighting , magnification , and therefore decreased the length of incision and tissue invasion .\nmicrodiscectomy also allowed the patients to return to early work with lesser use of narcotic medication .\nmicroendoscopic dissectomy ( med ) combines standard microsurgical technique with an endoscope , enabling the surgeons to address all types of disc herniations including decompression of nerve root and lateral recess .\nchemonucleolysis was reported by smith.15 nonetheless , based upon various randomized clinical trials , the efficacy of chemonucleolysis compared with more traditional and open procedures for the operative treatment of lumbar disc herniations remained speculative.16 the use of percutaneous nucleotomy , laser discectomy , and intradiscal electrothermal annuloplasty ( idet ) compared with microdiscectomy remains unclear , and it is attributed to the lack of high - quality studies.17 conclusions about the efficacy of some of the aforementioned minimally invasive procedures ( e.g. , chemonucleolysis , apd , idet ) were questionable with regard to disc - related pathology.18 therefore , lumbar microdiscectomy remained the gold standard for addressing a herniated or sequestrated intervertebral disc ; however , a movement toward more minimally invasive approaches that would yield superior outcomes , while minimizing excessive soft and bony tissue removal and minimizing soft tissue trauma , were sought . as such ,\nan evolution in procedures toward smaller incisions , less tissue trauma , and quicker return to daily activities took center stage in spine surgery .\nthe use of muscular retractor system was reported initially by faubert and caspar.1920 perez - curet and fessler,21 described for the first time a myriad of spine pathologies that could be addressed using tubeology .\nthough from our initial experience , endospine technique is minimal invasive , but limitation of study has been lack of comparison with gold standard microscopic discectomy technique .\nhowever , in a study by shin et al.,22 15 cases each were compared of med and microscopic group ( md ) .\nthe mean cpk -

cruet et al . , and\ntheir average surgical time was 66 minutes , average blood loss was 22 ml , average hospital stay was 7.7 hours , complication rate was 5% , reoperation rate was 4% , and average return to work was 17 days with excellent result in 94% patients .\naverage operative time was 50 minutes average blood loss was 45 ml ( range , 30 - 70 ml ) .\nreturn to work ( 21 days ) and overall results ( 90% ) which are comparable . in another prospective and randomized evaluation of surgical treatment for lumbar disc herniation by hermantin et al.,24 satisfactory results of 97% in endoscopic group ( n=30 ) and 93% in open laminectomy group ( n=30 ) were reported .\nhowever , in endoscopic group , these authors had excluded large central herniations and extra ligamentous herniations between l5 and first sacral vertebra .\nhowever , present endoscopic technique could be used for all levels and all type of herniations . in our current series , there was 5% discitis and 5% incidence of dural injury .\ncaspar and ebling,2526 authors have reported reoperation rate of 5.5 , 5.7 , and 3% , respectively .\nanother measure of success is reflected by the patient 's ability to return to previous employment .\nour patients returned to previous employment on an average at 15 days with restriction to avoid heavy manual work for 2 months .\ndiscectomy ( med ) by endospine system has claimed even lesser tissue invasion than microdiscectomy with even smaller skin incision , lesser use of analgesics , and early return to work .\nleast tissue invasion is established by many reports comparing the postoperative mri signal of paraspinal muscles,27 intraoperative electromyographic findings establishing less invasion to nerve roots,28 and by measuring serum levels of biochemical parameters reflective of a postoperative inflammatory reaction and damage to the paravertebral muscles.29 our personal opinion is similar , though this was not the parameter studied in our series .\nminimal invasive microendoscopic decompression technique has been used not only for paracentral disc herniations , but also for all types including far lateral , cephalad , caudal migrated , and central and recurrent disc herniations.3032 one of the driving forces behind the minimal invasive spine surgery is economics , shorter hospital stay , reduced postoperative morbidity , and quicker recovery times . in our series , 90% patients were operated as day care cases .\nposterior paraspinous process endoscopic access to lumbar disc herniation requires creation of working space where no or little space existed before .\ninternal view of operating site is magnified and well illuminated . with advent of this system ,\ndiscectomy can be done as day care procedure ensuring reduced postoperative morbidity , minimal or no hospitalization , less pain , and faster recovery .\nwith proper patient selection , discectomy and adequate nerve root decompression by doing foraminotomy or opening a lateral recess stenosis by minimally invasive technique can be achieved with this system .\nhowever , the endospine system has been excellent modality to address discogenic radiculopathy and to decompress lumbar canal stenosis .\nmany surgeons are convinced of advantages of the system and have included this system as part of their inventry . however , due to difficulty in orientation with scope and two - dimensional vision , availability of less space , frustrating and steep learning curve , and inability to master hand eye coordination , majority of surgeons are not able to continue with the technique .\nthe patience and persvrance to work through narrow confines and work closely with a surgeon who has mastered the technique is the key to learn .\nsecond step would be to become comfortable with 2 dimensional vision of endoscopic camera and to master orientation , triangulation .\ndepth perception in these techniques comes from experience rather than observation ; hence , surgeon keen to learn these techniques must combine these procedures during early phase of learning with standard procedures he is doing in his clinical practice . gradually , as surgeons master the learning curve , he will be able to use this as treatment method for his patients .\nthere is also a need to establish cadaveric labs and dummy models on line of arthroscopic learning centers where surgeons can practice hands - on cadavers and models to improve triangulation , depth perception , and hand eye coordination ."}

, long waiting lists for procedures in countries having public healthcare system , availability of high quality services at affordable price , and cheaper airfare . increased communication and internet access in developing countries\nare other supporting factors , which help patients to develop awareness about international travel for medical care ( 47 ) .\nestimations can vary but still

various factors related to patients travel such as source of information , perceived risks , benefits of medical tourism and attributes of medical tourism destinations in sufficient amount but almost all of these related accounts are exploratory in nature and do not provide conceptual frameworks for testing .\nmany researchers ( 2 , 6 , 11 , 12 ) made calls to explore more about the decision making process based on conceptual models and test them empirically , so managers in medical tourism industry will be more acquainted about the needs and requirements of patients and design their future strategies accordingly and at the same time patients will also be benefited by receiving more quality services from the providers .\nthis article will draw a conceptual model based on patients source of information , perceived benefits , perceived risks , and medical tourism destination image with available literature that will be helpful to mangers to draw their future course of action for competitive advantage and at the same time fulfill the gap in available literature .\nimage formation agents are the factors which control the perception and evaluation of image ( 13 ) . researchers addressed amount and diversity of information sources that expose individuals including information related to destination acquired through visiting particular place .\nvarious studies performed on destination selection behavior of tourists explored that with combination of other different factors , information sources explored by individuals determined certain destinations as possible alternatives ( 1317 ) .\nconsumer behavior studies have already established the effects of source of information on purchase behavior ( 18 ) .\namount and type of different information sources directly influence in development of cognitive image formation of destination ( 19 ) .\nsource of information is a vital antecedent of destination image formation and destination choice intention ( 20 ) .\nthere are four ( i ) professional advice ( tour operators , travel agents , airlines ) ( ii ) word of mouth ( friends , relatives , social media ) ( iii ) advertisement , and ( iv ) news / books / movies , different categories of type of information sources usually consider responsible for destination image formation ( 13 ) , this article use these four categories of source of information for medical tourism destinations image formation .\nmedical tourism facilitators are specialized in promotion of medical services abroad and offer supportive services such as assisting in selection of country and hospital , correspondence with doctors , travel arrangements , and arrangements of required paper work ( 21 , 22 ) .\njudgment of agent related to travel of their clients has high influence on decisions of clients ( 23 ) .\nthese facilitators serve as motivators also due to providing much - needed assistant to those unenthusiastic potential international patients who do not want to make their trip arrangements by their own .\nmany hospitals and clinics linked themselves with airlines to promote their services and offer discounts ( 2 , 5 , 2426 ) .\nliterature on medical tourism also reveals the role of practitioner in promotion of medical tourism mainly in underdeveloped countries due to various reasons such as lack of resources , unavailability of equipment , unavailability of infra - structure , unavailability of specialized manpower , and unavailability of medication ( 2730 ) .\nword of mouth and recommendation also has high influence in decision making of international patients in selection of destinations , hospitals , and doctors .\nstudies revealed large numbers of patients visit different countries for medical services were received recommendations from family members , friends , relatives , and colleagues ( 3134 ) .\nwebsites and online forums created by experienced international patients to share their experiences with medical tourism are also considered as decisive source of information for those planning to take medical services abroad ( 35 , 36 ) .\nprinted materials are also used to promote the services by hospitals and clinics , for example air mauritius in - flight magazine provides details about procedures and services provided by the hair grafting clinics in mauritius ( 2 ) .\nmajor medium of promotion of services by destination countries are trade fairs , travel markets / travel fairs , exhibitions , seminars and conferences to make potential patients informed about products and services offered by destinations .\nsome of these fairs and exhibitions are organized in collaboration with government agencies like tat , ministry of foreign affairs and department of export promotion but some providers organized these events by their own in cooperation with local institutes , medical schools and universities ( 37 ) .\nprint media play an important role in promotion and advertising medical tourism in major source countries , publish attractive and evidence based stories in their different segments related to health and travel .\nlos angeles time first examined about the growth of medical tourism and marked it as trend . later on new york times and los angeles times published stories of satisfied patients .\nfox , cbs s  60 minutes  and cnn aired their segments on patients traveling to medical services .\nmagazines like forbes and wall street journal analyzed the business aspect of medical tourism as  brokers assertively marketed medical tourism to consumers , employers , and insurers ( 38 ) .\nliterature revealed that not every physical attribute of a destination has influence on image formation process .\nthere is substantial inequality between descriptive dimensions of image and the attributes which are considered important for decision making within individuals ( 39 ) .\nit is generally presumed in marketing that products with similar characteristics will be equally preferred by the consumers , however , attributes , which make the product similar to other products , will not be necessarily same at the time of actual purchase . the importance of attributes will be change according to the need of consumer ( 40 ) . wish ( 1971 ) cited in ( 40 ) found that despite have many similarities individual like one country and dislike another one .\nthis is due to dimensions of liking may not be agree with the dimensions of similarity .\nliterature revealed that many researchers made distinction between physical and beneficial aspect of a product .\nfew researchers explained it as  characteristic and  benefits to the physical and beneficial aspect of product respectively ( 41 ) .\nthe typology of different attributes of product has been proven fruitful because by this a product s features can be segments into three groups as characteristic , beneficial , and imagery .\nthere are three components of vacation destination image formation ; ( i ) based on awareness : rely on the information sources , tourist believes about what a destination possesses , ( ii ) based on attitude : feelings and beliefs about destination , and ( iii ) based on expectations : expected benefits obtain from a tourist product ( 43 ) .\nthe above mention discussion clearly indicates that process of image formation is not just emphasis on physical attributes of destination but also depends on benefits or consumption values of product or service consumers hold in their minds .\nbenefits offered by a product or service are considered as consumption value of the same ( 44 ) .\nsheth , newman and gross ( 1991 ) developed a theory known as theory of consumption values , which focuses on consumption values of products and services ( 45 ) .\nconditional value. the decision making of consumer choice behaviour can be based on all five or any of the five consumption values .\nconsumption value model define the characteristics of  functional value as price , credibility , and durability .\nmedical tourism destinations offer very low price for medical services to international patients in comparison to developed countries , and most of the time price of a procedure in india and other asian destination is equal to 1/10 of price in us or european countries ( 4 , 4648 ) .\nquality of medical services is one of the aspects which drive medical tourism high towards success .\nmost of the hospitals in india provide medical care services to international patients are certified by jci which has reputation for hospital safety and regulatory management and recognized worldwide ( 49 ) .\nhigh procedure success rate also forms image as quality medical tourism destination of various destinations at south asian , african and latin america ( 48 , 49 ) .\nalthough availability of literature explain  social value in medical tourism is less , little available literature clearly define the \nsocial value aspect has been clearly observed in yemeni patients travel abroad for treatment ( 27 , 50 ) .\nsenior male members of the household consider it as opportunity to increase their reputation in society . availing expensive and prestigious medical care service in foreign countries and the associated sacrifices with it would make stories full of pride to tell to others ( 51 ) .\nmost of the citizens of yemen do not obtain resources to go for leisure travel at different parts of the world therefore traveling to foreign country for medical services provide chance to explore new territory , meet new people , and experience different social culture ( 27 , 50 ) .\nhowever , the concept of social value and epistemic value may not be associated with patients from developed regions .\nmany researchers found in their studies that patients were highly motivated to travel to a particular destination due to emotional attachment with doctor , hospitals or destination ( 6 , 50 ) .\nsuch as , many omani patients visit shiraz in iran for treatment due to religious and cultural familiarity ( 52 ) .\nconditional value can be considered as major factor pushes patients to travel abroad because medical needs are crucial and considered as unavoidable so have great conditional value .\nperceived risks is defined as perception of an individual about the probability that a particular action will lead them to a situation exposed with danger more than acceptable limit , and will lead to influence travel decision - making ( 53 ) . security and safety at the destination is major issue of concern by the potential travelers . in travel decision ,\nmaking perception of risks has utmost importance due to its tendency to alter destination selection ( 54 ) .\nresearchers argued in favor of conducting study on perceived risks and destination image together ( 55 ) . in tourism literature , authors considered safety and security at destination as one of the pull factors caused destination image formation ( 13 , 14 , 56 ) .\nhowever , in general cognitive image of destination does not engage with varied range of travel specific risks at destination and consider safety and risks as one of the many other attributes associated with destination ( 54 ) .\nin addition , at the same time perceived risks are considered as potential inhibitors of travel ( 57 ) .\nresearchers argued that using cognitive image to understand the dimensions of travel risks will be a conceptual mistake ( 58 ) .\nhence , perceived risks and cognitive image should consider individual variables for image related studies in travel .\ncredence goods as the quality of these good can not be assessed accurately even after consumption .\npatients may vulnerable to many risks if consider to take medical services at medical tourism destinations .\nresearchers described six dimension of risks associated with health travelers visited israel as  human - induced risks , \nfinancial risks ,  service quality risks ,  socio - psychological risk ,  natural disasters and car accident risk , and \nafter thorough literature review , authors categorized medical tourism destination perceived risks into three categories , as  physical - health related risks ,  service related risks , and  destination related risks. physical risks are considered as possibility of physical danger or injury detrimental to health where as health risks are considered as possibility to becoming sick while traveling or at destination ( 54 ) .\nin medical tourism , international patients can be exposed with different diseases , so risk of contracting with a different kind of disease is even higher such as blood borne infection and infection due to improper screening and storage of blood , deep - vein thrombosis ( dvt ) to those patients returning home after surgery , language related risks and lose of money can also be a matter of concern while involved in medical tourism .\nhealth risks for patients travel for organ transplant is even higher due to ignorance of standard protocol in donor selection ( 12 , 6062 ) .\nliterature revealed few american patients came in contact with non - tuberculous mycobecterial infection while taking treatment in hospitals abroad ( 63 , 64 ) .\nresearchers consider terrorism and kidnapping of rich patients and unstable economy of the destination as other risks associated with medical related travel .\napart from physical - health and service related risks , every destination have its own associated risks ; risks of terrorism , crime , and personal safety are associated with medical tourism destination due to falling in middle and lower middle - income countries in development status ( 63 ) . according to researchers , destination image is the total of ideas , beliefs , and impressions individuals possess about the attributes of destination and or activities available at a destination after processing information from various sources over a period of time ( 39 , 65 ) .\ndestination image as overall imagery picture individual obtains in his mind ( 66 ) . in the early studies on travel\n, researchers used the concept of stereotypic image of a travel destination ( 67 , 68 ) . later on , to understand the destination image formation process researchers developed an alternative framework and argued destination image consist of two components i.e. attribute based and holistic ( 66 ) .\nattribute based component refers to the perception of individual based on destination features and holistic component refers to imaginary mental image of destination .\nlater on , a bi - dimensional model was presented by researchers to represent destination image , consist of cognitive and affective image component ( 13 , 69 ) .\nthe cognitive component of destination image develops on knowledge and beliefs of destination based on tangible attributes , whereas affective component of image develops on emotions and feelings about the destination ( 70 , 71 ) .\nresearchers further studied affective image of destination and illustrate a four semantic differential scale to evaluate the affective component of destination image based on arousing \nfurthermore , cognitive component of destination image is an antecedent of affective component ( 72 ) .\nthus , a distinctive image of a destination forms in tourists mind based on strength and weakness of attributes of cognitive and affective components . image of destination formed in consumer s mind is defined as aggregate of attributes and beliefs ( 73 ) .\nit means if tourist has enough level of positive beliefs about attributes of destination it is expected that s / he has developed favorable attitude towards destination .\nthe process of destination image formation is described as mental construct of representation of destination based on information cues transmitted by image inducing agents chosen by individual ( 19 ) .\nafter thorough literature review authors identified four dimension of cognitive medical tourism destination image based of different attributes projected by different medical tourism destinations , as ;  medical amenities ,  general infra - structure ,  tourism attractions , and \nsocial environment. most of the hospitals websites are dominated with images stressing on sophistication , advanced technology , cleanliness and efficiency .\nmajority of these sites are in english highlight the variety of procedures , price , accreditation of hospitals , and affiliation of doctors , qualified and smart staff , lavishly furnished accommodations , and testimonials of past patients , and efficiency with different languages of staff .\ncommand on technology is rarely missed in any form of marketing ( 12 , 46 , 74 , 75 ) .\nbased on mentioned qualities , medical tourism destinations project themselves as most suited destination for potential travelers ( 28 , 32 , 76 ) . to nullify the quality related concerns of international patients hospitals and medical tourism facilitators / brokers emphasis on the markers of quality services .\nphysicians trainings in world reputed institutes like national institute for health , johns hopkins university , university of birmingham , and other reputed universities are highlighted in the profiles of physicians .\nprominent display of training and expertise of doctors achieve two goals ; established trustworthiness and mitigate concerns related to risk .\nthe accreditation awarded by jci is promoted by hospitals as mark of offering medical care of american standards ( 2 , 28 , 77 ) .\ncollaboration with prestigious hospitals in us and europe in also indicate seriousness towards providing quality services to patients by medical tourism hospitals at different destination ( 21 , 78 ) . distinguishing that major market drivers such as lack of health insurance and unaffordability are influencing patients to take procedures abroad , websites of brokerages predominantly display the comparative cost charts and price schedules .\nmost of the destinations claim providing significant cost services through different sources of promotion ( 5 , 79 , 80 ) .\nmost the promotions and advertisements show smiling , well - dressed and empathetic medical staff taking care of international patients .\nmany hospitals focus on multi - lingual staff providing services to patients speaking different major languages of the world .\nlanguage is also an influencing factor in decision making in selection of destination ( 11 , 37 ) .\nfacilities and quality of accommodation to international patients and their companions play important role in attracting the foreign patients .\nessential supportive services like local transportation services , food , communication , and others are also important in attracting the patients to a destination .\nthailand for example attracts more patients from developed countries because of already established quality tourism infrastructure offer excellent accommodation and hospitality services to international patients ( 81 ) . despite offering excellent medical care to international patients by hospitals in india most of the international patients visit india worry about accommodation quality , food hygiene , and personal safety ( 82 , 83 ) .\npotential tourists prefer to receive medical services to the places where they are also interested for holidaying ( 75 , 84 ) . after focusing on cost and reliability\nimage formation agents are the factors which control the perception and evaluation of image ( 13 ) . researchers addressed amount and diversity of information sources that expose individuals including information related to destination acquired through visiting particular place .\nvarious studies performed on destination selection behavior of tourists explored that with combination of other different factors , information sources explored by individuals determined certain destinations as possible alternatives ( 1317 ) .\nconsumer behavior studies have already established the effects of source of information on purchase behavior ( 18 ) .\namount and type of different information sources directly influence in development of cognitive image formation of destination ( 19 ) .\nsource of information is a vital antecedent of destination image formation and destination choice intention ( 20 ) .\nthere are four ( i ) professional advice ( tour operators , travel agents , airlines ) ( ii ) word of mouth ( friends , relatives , social media ) ( iii ) advertisement , and ( iv ) news / books / movies , different categories of type of information sources usually consider responsible for destination image formation ( 13 ) , this article use these four categories of source of information for medical tourism destinations image formation .\nmedical tourism facilitators are specialized in promotion of medical services abroad and offer supportive services such as assisting in selection of country and hospital , correspondence with doctors , travel arrangements , and arrangements of required paper work ( 21 , 22 ) .\njudgment of agent related to travel of their clients has high influence on decisions of clients ( 23 ) .\nthese facilitators serve as motivators also due to providing much - needed assistant to those unenthusiastic potential international patients who do not want to make their trip arrangements by their own .\nmany hospitals and clinics linked themselves with airlines to promote their services and offer discounts ( 2 , 5 , 2426 ) .\nliterature on medical tourism also reveals the role of practitioner in promotion of medical tourism mainly in underdeveloped countries due to various reasons such as lack of resources , unavailability of equipment , unavailability of infra - structure , unavailability of specialized manpower , and unavailability of medication ( 2730 ) .\nword of mouth and recommendation also has high influence in decision making of international patients in selection of destinations , hospitals , and doctors .\nstudies revealed large numbers of patients visit different countries for medical services were received recommendations from family members , friends , relatives , and colleagues ( 3134 ) .\nwebsites and online forums created by experienced international patients to share their experiences with medical tourism are also considered as decisive source of information for those planning to take medical services abroad ( 35 , 36 ) .\nprinted materials are also used to promote the services by hospitals and clinics , for example air mauritius in - flight magazine provides details about procedures and services provided by the hair grafting clinics in mauritius ( 2 ) .\nmajor medium of promotion of services by destination countries are trade fairs , travel markets / travel fairs , exhibitions , seminars and conferences to make potential patients informed about products and services offered by destinations .\nsome of these fairs and exhibitions are organized in collaboration with government agencies like tat , ministry of foreign affairs and department of export promotion but some providers organized these events by their own in cooperation with local institutes , medical schools and universities ( 37 ) .\nprint media play an important role in promotion and advertising medical tourism in major source countries , publish attractive and evidence based stories in their different segments related to health and travel .\nlos angeles time first examined about the growth of medical tourism and marked it as trend . later on new york times and los angeles times published stories of satisfied patients .\nfox , cbs s  60 minutes  and cnn aired their segments on patients traveling to medical services .\nmagazines like forbes and wall street journal analyzed the business aspect of medical tourism as  brokers assertively marketed medical tourism to consumers , employers , and insurers ( 38 ) .\nliterature revealed that not every physical attribute of a destination has influence on image formation process .\nthere is substantial inequality between descriptive dimensions of image and the attributes which are considered important for decision making within individuals ( 39 ) .\nit is generally presumed in marketing that products with similar characteristics will be equally preferred by the consumers , however , attributes , which make the product similar to other products , will not be necessarily same at the time of actual purchase . the importance of attributes will be change according to the need of consumer ( 40 ) . wish ( 1971 ) cited in ( 40 ) found that despite have many similarities individual like one country and dislike another one .\nthis is due to dimensions of liking may not be agree with the dimensions of similarity .\nliterature revealed that many researchers made distinction between physical and beneficial aspect of a product .\nfew researchers explained it as  characteristic and  benefits to the physical and beneficial aspect of product respectively ( 41 ) .\nthe typology of different attributes of product has been proven fruitful because by this a product s features can be segments into three groups as characteristic , beneficial , and imagery .\nthere are three components of vacation destination image formation ; ( i ) based on awareness : rely on the information sources , tourist believes about what a destination possesses , ( ii ) based on attitude : feelings and beliefs about destination , and ( iii ) based on expectations : expected benefits obtain from a tourist product ( 43 ) .\nthe above mention discussion clearly indicates that process of image formation is not just emphasis on physical attributes of destination but also depends on benefits or consumption values of product or service consumers hold in their minds .\nbenefits offered by a product or service are considered as consumption value of the same ( 44 ) .\nsheth , newman and gross ( 1991 ) developed a theory known as theory of consumption values , which focuses on consumption values of products and services ( 45 ) .\nconditional value. the decision making of consumer choice behaviour can be based on all five or any of the five consumption values .\nconsumption value model define the characteristics of  functional value as price , credibility , and durability .\nmedical tourism destinations offer very low price for medical services to international patients in comparison to developed countries , and most of the time price of a procedure in india and other asian destination is equal to 1/10 of price in us or european countries ( 4 , 4648 ) .\nquality of medical services is one of the aspects which drive medical tourism high towards success .\nmost of the hospitals in india provide medical care services to international patients are certified by jci which has reputation for hospital safety and regulatory management and recognized worldwide ( 49 ) .\nhigh procedure success rate also forms image as quality medical tourism destination of various destinations at south asian , african and latin america ( 48 , 49 ) .\nalthough availability of literature explain  social value in medical tourism is less , little available literature clearly define the  social value factor with - in the patient groups especially from less developed regions .\nsocial value aspect has been clearly observed in yemeni patients travel abroad for treatment ( 27 , 50 ) .\nsenior male members of the household consider it as opportunity to increase their reputation in society . availing expensive and prestigious medical care service in foreign countries and the associated sacrifices with it would make stories full of pride to tell to others ( 51 )

cost and reliability\nprominent databases ( 2013 , 2014 , 2015 ) have been searched to obtain desire literature related to medical tourism including science direct , utmj.org , nih.gov , nchu.edu.tw , palgrave - journals , medretreat , biomedcentral and so on and the keywords used are medical tourism , information sources , medical travel , health travel and so on .\ngoogle search was performed to get latest data related to medical tourism . to know in detail about the variables used in the framework scientific research databases\nthe key words used to find out research variables as well as relationship between researches variables were destination image , destination information sources , beneficial image , perceived travel risks , cognitive image , affective image , consumption values and so on . to obtain data about medical tourism various types of available literature were reviewed such as industry reports , market research reports , media reports and internet sources , however for identification and explanation of variables scientific literature published in reputed journals only were included .\nthe theory of planned ( tpb ) is an established and comprehensively tested model details the relationship between beliefs , attitude , intention , and actual behavior of consumers ( 85 ) . the model is perfectly applied in a variety of studies including leisure and tourism travel , and hospitality ( 36 , 8688 ) .\nthese research studies emphases on the factors such as motivations , information sources , attitudes , and visit intentions , thus authors argue that attitudinal theory provides a sound foundation to understand travel intentions of international patients and underpin the conceptual model discussed in this article .\nstudies explained that consumers access more information in case of high association of risks or benefits or both in a particular act ( 89 , 90 ) and perform rigorous information search in case of planning first time trip ( 91 ) because first time trip is associated with unknown risks as well as unknown leisure activities .\nin general consumer behaviour practices risk - handling activity increases in case of high level of perceived risks .\nimportance of risk handling activity also determines by associated benefits gained after engaging with risk taking activity ( 92 ) .\nthe benefits of information search includes possibility of finding superior alternative to those already considered and the reduction in risk achieved from eliminating inferior , but a priori uncertain , alternatives ( 93 ) . with the discussion of above literature related to tourism\nit could be assumed that medical tourism information sources will have positive influence on perceived travel benefits of international patients . whereas , information sources of medical tourism will negatively influence perceived travel risks of international patients .\ndestination image is considered as perceptions or impressions of destination held by tourists with respect to the expected benefit or consumption values .\nthe benefits sought by the travelers are highly associated with the image of destination and the affective image of destination is largely highly influenced by the motivations / benefits sought by individuals ( 13 , 44 ) .\nthe affective image of a destination is more positive in individual s mind when emotions evoked by the place coincide with the benefits sought ( 95 ) .\nrisks and constraints associated with travel have significant impact on destination image formation at the time of early decision - making process ( 96 ) . according to researchers ,\ntwo dimensions significantly influence cognitive and affective image of destination ( 58 ) . on the basis of previous studies in tourism literature\nit can be assumed that perceived travel benefits of international patients will positively influence the destination image , whereas perceived travel risks of international patients will negatively influence the destination image .\nintention of visit related to travel is considered as tourists perceived likelihood to visit particular destination within a specific time period ( 97 ) .\nthus , to be closely correlated to the travel behaviour intention of visit believes as an important outcome variable in tourism research ( 16 , 97 ) .\nintention to visit a destination is highly influenced by cognitive / perceptual and affective evaluation ( 98 ) .\ndestination image is a direct antecedent of perceived quality , satisfaction and revisit intention and recommendation ( 99 ) . according to researchers\n, there is significant theoretical and empirical link between cognitive destination image and behavioral intention ( 100 ) .\nbased on above discussion it could be assumed that image of medical tourism destination will positively influence visit intention of international patients . conceptual framework  international patients travel decision making\nthe article is a sincere effort by authors to establish conceptual framework which explains decision - making process of international patients .\nthough , there has been advance in explaining different factors play important roles in international patients travel , however , there is scarcity of literature conceptualizing these factors into a framework and test it empirically .\nliterature reveals about associated benefits and risks related to travel abroad for medical purposes but do not conceptualize it in the process of decision - making .\nsources of information in medical tourism play significant role in development of attitude as well as intention , has already been established in consumer behavior .\nhowever , need is to test its significance in medical tourism decision - making process .\nthe proposed framework will encourage future researchers to test different variables empirically and establish the model of international patients travel behavior .\nethical issues ( including plagiarism , informed consent , misconduct , data fabrication and/or falsification , double publication and/or submission , redundancy , etc . ) have been completely observed by the authors

{"lay_summary": " molecular therapeutics for treating epidermal growth factor receptor-(egfr- ) expressing cancers are a specific method for treating cancers compared to general cell loss with standard cytotoxic therapeutics .   \n however , the finding that resistance to such therapy is common in clinical trials now dampens the initial enthusiasm over this targeted treatment .   \n yet an improved molecular understanding of other receptor tyrosine kinases known to be active in cancer has revealed a rich network of cross - talk between receptor pathways with a key finding of common downstream signaling pathways . \n such cross talk may represent a key mechanism for resistance to egfr - directed therapy .   \n here we review the interplay between egfr and met and the type 1 insulin - like growth factor receptor ( igf-1r ) tyrosine kinases , as well as their contribution to anti - egfr therapeutic resistance in the context of squamous cell cancer of the head and neck , a tumor known to be primarily driven by egfr - related oncogenic signals . ", "article": "squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck ( hnscc ) is a heterogeneous disease that includes tumors arising from the mucosal epithelial surface of the oral cavity , oropharynx , hypopharynx , and larynx . although these tumors originate within different anatomic sites within the upper aerodigestive tract , they are histologically identical ( 95% of hnscc are squamous cell carcinomas ) , share common etiologic risk factors and overlapping metastatic target site profiles ( reviewed in [ 13 ] ) .\nrecent genetic analysis of human head and neck tumors has revealed common molecular alterations including p53 mutation , p14arf , and p16 methylation , as well as cyclin d and egfr amplification [ 36 ] . despite these similarities ,\nthe distinct anatomic subsites are associated with differing rates of regional metastasis  for example , vocal cord lesions tend to metastasize less frequently than oropharyngeal or hypopharyngeal lesions . this variation may be attributed to differing densities of lymph draining vessels within each of the relevant subsites .\npatients who exhibit metastases into the regional nodal basin exhibit a 50% decrease in survival irrespective of treatment [ 715 ] .\ncurrently , it is the 5th leading cause of cancer by incidence and the 6th leading cause of cancer mortality in the world [ 16 , 17 ] .\nrecurrent and/or metastatic hnscc patients have a poor prognosis , with a median survival of less than 1 - 2 years [ 18 , 19 ] .\nseveral lines of evidence indicate that cancer is a disease resulting from dynamic changes in the genome that promote the progressive transformation of normal human cells into highly malignant derivatives [ 20 , 21 ] . during this process ,\ncancer cells acquire several unique capabilities including self - sufficiency in response to growth signals , insensitivity to antigrowth signals , evasion of programmed death ( apoptosis ) , limitless replicative potential , sustained angiogenesis as well as invasion and metastasis , reprogramming of energy metabolism , and avoiding immune destruction [ 21 , 22 ] .\ndetailed global genomic analyses of several human tumors has revealed that certain classes of signaling proteins appear to be targeted more frequently by oncogenic mutations .\nreceptor tyrosine kinases ( rtks ) are a good example . of the 59 transmembrane rtks identified to date ,\ndysregulation of ~30 rtks are associated with neoplastic transformation and cancer progression [ 2325 ] .\ninterestingly , ninety percent of primary head and neck squamous cell cancers , irrespective of subsite , have alterations in members of the epidermal growth factor ( egf ) family of receptor tyrosine kinases ( erbbs ) , in particular erbb1/egfr .\nten to fifteen percent of tumors will also have an alteration in another egfr family member , the erbb2/her2/neu receptor [ 27 , 28 ] .\nthese findings suggest a strong etiologic role for rtk dysregulation in this type of tumors . given this association , patients with head and neck squamous cell cancers are well positioned to benefit from existing and future molecular targeted agents directed against oncogenic rtks such as egfr ( reviewed in ) .     \nrtks are a family of transmembrane proteins that mediate many important physiological processes in both normal and cancerous cells .\nligand binding to the extracellular domain of rtks induces receptor dimerization and activation of rtk activity .\nsubsequent autophosphorylation of the receptor at specific tyrosine residues within the cytoplasmic domain generates binding sites for proteins that relay downstream biological signals to regulate protein function , protein - protein interactions , and gene expression . under physiological conditions ,\nrtk dysregulation can occur through several mechanisms including gene amplification or rtk overexpression , chromosomal translocation to produce constitutively active rtks , gain of function mutations or deletions that promote ligand - independent rtk activity , escape from negative regulatory mechanisms or local environmental changes , all of which lead to potent oncogenic signaling and hence neoplastic growth .\nthese complex signaling networks use multiple factors to drive the outcome of rtk signaling . although often depicted as linear pathways , they actually represent an integrated network with various modes of cross - talk , overlapping and distinct functions .\nknown signaling pathways involved in head and neck tumorigenesis include the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase ( pi3k)-akt - mammalian target of rapamycin ( mtor ) , signal transducer and activator of transcription ( stats ) and raf kinase - mitogen - activated protein kinase kinase ( mek)-p42/p44 mitogen activated protein kinase ( mapk ) signaling pathways [ 1 , 30 ] .\nthis review highlights three rtk signaling pathways involved in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma ; egfr , the type 1 insulin - like growth factor receptor ( igf-1r ) and the hepatocyte growth factor ( hgf ) receptor ( met ) .\nthis short review will explore the relative contribution of each signaling axis to disease progression , potential modes of cross - talk , and targeted clinical approaches under investigation for disease management .\nthe egfr family of rtks is comprised of four different receptors known as erbb1 ( also referred to as egfr ) , erbb2 ( her2/neu in rodents ) , erbb3 ( her3 ) , and erbb4 ( her4 ) ( reviewed in [ 3133 ] ) . each receptor , with the exception of erbb3 , contain an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain that is activated by binding to extracellular egf - like ligands , which result in receptor dimerization and hence activation of downstream signaling cascades including mapk , pi3k / akt and stat signaling .\neleven egf - like ligands have been identified to date that can be categorized into four groups  those that bind egfr only ( egf , transforming growth factor alpha ( tgf ) , and amphiregulin ) , those that bind to egfr and her4 ( heparin binding - egf , betacellulin and epiregulin ) , those binding directly to either her3 and her4 ( neuregulin 1 and neuregulin 2 ) and her4 binding only ( neuregulin 3 and neuregulin 4 ) ( reviewed in ) .\nepigen , the most recently discovered member of the egf - like ligand family appears to be a low affinity and broad specificity ligand that effectively activates egfr .\nerbb2 is considered a ligand - less coreceptor as it does not have any known ligands that bind directly with high affinity , despite its established role as a potent oncogene in several cancer types including breast , colorectal , nonsmall cell lung carcinoma ( nsclc ) and hnscc [ 36 , 37 ] .  \naberrant egfr activity has been strongly linked to the etiology of 5890% of hnscc [ 26 , 38 ] .\nthese rates can vary due to the inclusion of cancers from different subsites within the head and neck , methods used to assess gene amplification and tumor scoring methods . in contrast to lung adenocarcinomas in which activating egfr mutations result in ligand - independent signaling [ 3943 ] , such activating egfr mutations are infrequent in hnscc [ 44 , 45 ] .\negfr gene amplification resulting in upwards of 12 copies per cell has been reported in hnscc patients compared to copy numbers detected in normal mucosa from noncancer patients .\nthis and other pathways of ligand - independent receptor activation that do not require egfr overexpression have been characterized as the likely drivers of egfr activity in hnscc .  \negfr gene amplification remains a strong indicator for poor patient survival , radioresistance , and locoregional failure [ 4749 ] .\negfr overexpression is detected in healthy mucosa in cancer patients ( field cancerization ) that will increase in proportion to observed histological abnormalities such as hyperplasia , carcinoma in situ and invasive carcinoma , indicating that it is an early event in hnscc .\naccordingly , significant effort has focused on egfr signaling as a therapeutic target for treating hnscc patients .\ncetuximab , matuzumab and nimotuzumab represent humanized antiegfr antibodies , whereas gefitinib and erlotinib are small tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( tkis ) ( figure 1 ) .\ncetuximab ( erbitux ) competitively inhibits endogenous ligand - binding to egfr and thereby inhibits subsequent receptor activation [ 5053 ] .\ncetuximab is a valuable treatment option in head and neck patients as it synergizes with current treatment modalities .\ncetuximab enhances the effects of many standard cytotoxic agents , including cisplatin ( the conventional platinum - fluorouracil chemotherapeutic ) , and in combination with chemotherapy it can elicit antitumor responses in tumors that previously failed to respond to that chemotherapy .\nnotably , cetuximab did not dramatically exacerbate the common toxic effects associated with radiotherapy of the head and neck , including mucositis , xerostomia , dysphagia , pain , weight loss , and performance status deterioration .\ncetuximab has been approved for use in combination with radiation for treating patients with locally advanced hnscc   and as monotherapy for patients with recurrent hnscc .\nmatuzumab ( formerly emd 72000 ) binds to egfr with high specificity and affinity to block receptor signaling , and also modulates antibody - dependent cellular cytotoxicity ( adcc ) when combined with cetuximab [ 5860 ] .\nphase i clinical trials report excellent antitumor activity of matuzumab against several human tumor types including head and neck cancers .\na randomized phase iib , four - arm , open - label study recently assessed the safety and efficacy of nimotuzumab in combination with radiation therapy ( rt ) or chemoradiation therapy ( crt ) in patients with advanced ( stage iii or iva ) hnscc .\nthe addition of nimotuzumab to both the radiation and chemoradiation regimens was reported to improve the overall response rate , survival rate at 30 months , median progression - free survival and median overall survival .\na combined group analysis of the nimotuzumab arms versus the non - nimotuzumab arms demonstrated a significant difference in overall survival favoring nimotuzumab .\nthis study is compelling as patient response rates compare favorably with studies combining cetuximab with radiotherapy , but with fewer side effects .\ngefitinib ( iressa ) is a small molecule tki - targeted to the intracellular active site for phosphorylation that has been tested in clinical trials involving hnscc patients , as a single agent or in combination with radiation treatment .\nunfortunately , gefitinib has shown limited clinical efficacy with response rates of 1015% [ 63 , 64 ] .\nerlotinib is a selective inhibitor of the egfr that also shows antitumor activity in hnscc comparable to standard combination chemotherapy .\nanother promising rtk under preclinical and clinical evaluation for head and neck cancers includes the igf-1r ( reviewed in [ 66 , 67 ] ) .\ntwo ligands , insulin - like growth factor 1 ( igf1 ) and igf2 bind to igf-1r .\nligand binding to the igf-1r stimulates its intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity , activating downstream signaling networks including ras - raf , mapk and erk , and pi3k ( figure 1 ) to drive cellular functions such as cell growth , survival and differentiation .\nit is widely accepted that the igf - axis activates antiapoptotic signaling , which in turn upregulates the pi3k - akt and mapk pathways in cancer cells .\nadditionally , igf - ir also regulates vascular endothelial growth factor ( vegf ) production , suggesting a role in tumor angiogenesis .\nseveral studies indicate that igf-1r is overexpressed and functional in 94% of hnscc patient samples [ 70 , 71 ] .\nconsistent with this , igf - ir signaling significantly enhances the proliferation , motility and tumorigenicity of human head and neck cancer cell lines . igf-1r\ndown regulation in a hnscc cell line using antisense oligonucleotides resulted in a dose - dependent decrease in cellular proliferation , induction of apoptosis , caspase activation and reduced expression of proangiogenic cytokines such as vegf .\ninterest in targeting the igf-1r in hnscc was bolstered by the observation that treatment of head and neck cancer cells with either igf or egf resulted in igf - ir and egfr heterodimerization [ 71 , 72 ] .\nhowever , only igf resulted in the phosphorylation of both receptors . using a mouse xenograft model for hnscc , treatment with antibodies against igf-1r , egfr or\nit remains to be determined whether cellular cross - talk between igf-1r and egfr has an important role in determining the biological aggressiveness of hnscc or resistance to egfr - targeted therapies .  \nseveral monoclonal antibodies and tkis for igf-1r have been tested in preclinical studies and early phase clinical studies .\nhowever , the efficacy of igf-1r - targeted therapy for treating patients with hnscc , particularly cross - talk with egfr , warrants further investigation . to date , the effect of blocking oncogenic igf-1r and egfr signaling have been studied more extensively in breast cancer cell lines [ 7375 ] .\ntreatment with gefitinib and ag1024 , a tki for igf-1r reduced cell proliferation when used as single agents and showed an additive effect when used in combination [ 76 , 77 ] . targeting igf-1r and egfr signaling is currently under evaluation in hormone - sensitive metastatic breast cancer using the igf-1r inhibitor osi-906 and the egfr tki erlotinib , although results are not yet available ( http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ , identifier nct01205685 ) . similarly , an exploratory study to assess the modulation of biomarkers in hnscc patients treated preoperatively with cetuximab and/or imc - a12 , a humanized antiigf-1r monoclonal antibody is currently underway ( http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ , identifier nct00617734 ) .\nthese studies will be critical for evaluating whether the use of anti - igf-1r and egfr - targeted treatments will be more effective than single - agent modalities for treating patients with hnscc .\nthe met receptor is a single pass transmembrane protein that upon binding its ligand hgf  also known as scatter factor - promotes increased cell proliferation , survival and motility ( reviewed in [ 78 , 79 ] ) .\nhgf is the only physiological ligand for met and is secreted as an inactive precursor polypeptide chain by mesenchymal cells .\nhgf is proteolytically cleaved to form an active / heterodimer by a number of serine proteases including urokinase plasminogen activator ( upa ) , tissue - type plasminogen activator ( tpa ) , coagulation factors x. xi and xii .\nmet is a disulphide - linked / heterodimer derived from the proteolytic cleavage of a 170  kda precursor .\nthe  chain and n - terminal region of the -chain form  sema domain , a seven -propeller structure in which blades 2 and 3 bind to hgf .\nthe sema domain is flanked by a cysteine - rich region followed by four immunoglobulin repeats .\nit is proposed that the cysteine - rich region and immunoglobulin repeat domains undergo a conformational change following hgf binding allowing for met dimerization [ 80 , 81 ] .\nbinding of hgf to met results in receptor autophosphorylation at key catalytic residues and subsequent recruitment of several cytosolic signaling molecules that are shared with the egfr and igf-1r signaling pathways , including the grb2/sos complex , the p85 regulatory subunit of pi3k , gab1 and jak / stat3 ( figure 1 ) .\nsubsequent activation of the mapk and jun - n - terminal kinase ( jnk ) pathways is responsible for the mitogenic and motogenic properties of met / hgf signaling resulting in  invasive growth  , depending on the physiological setting .\nincreased met signaling in human cancers can be the result of enhanced ligand - binding ( autocrine and paracrine ) , met overexpression or missense mutations that often induce constitutive kinase activity , failure of met down regulation and interactions with other cell surface receptors such as egfr ( reviewed in [ 8284 ] ) . met is overexpressed in 84% of hnscc patient samples .\ninterestingly , amplification of the met gene ( > 10 copies per cell ) is present only in 3 of 23 ( 13% ) tumor tissues .\nhgf overexpression is detected in 45% of hnsccs , suggesting that hgf functions predominantly in a paracrine manner to drive met signaling in these cancers .\nmoreover , high levels of hgf are detected in hnscc patient plasma samples   supporting the idea that ligand availability is not a limiting factor for met activation .\nmutations in the met ligand - binding domain ( t230m / e168d ) , transmembrane or jm domain ( r988c , t1010i ) and the tyrosine kinase domain ( t1275i , v14333i ) have also been identified in hnscc tumor samples , although their relative contribution to hnscc progression remains to be determined .\ntwo somatic met mutations have been detected in hnscc that result in constitutively active receptor signaling that confers an invasive phenotype when ectopically expressed in cell lines .\nthe y1230c mutation confers anchorage - independent growth and an invasive phenotype in transfected cells , whereas the y1235d met mutation stimulates epithelial cells to invade reconstituted basement membrane in the absence of hgf . in the case of the mety1235d mutation\n, genomic analyses of hnscc patient samples detected the presence of this mutant allele in 50% of metastatic tumors versus 26% in primary tumors , raising the possibility that this could be a critical genetic lesion for the acquisition of a metastatic phenotype .\nalternatively , increased met signaling could afford hnscc a selective advantage for growth and/or survival in metastatic sites , such as the lymph node and lung .\nindeed several studies indicate that met overexpression correlates highly with lymph node metastasis , pathologic stage , and disease reoccurrence [ 8891 ] .\nmoreover , patient survival was significantly reduced in biopsy samples with positive met expression relative to negative met expression , suggesting the association of met with hnscc disease progression .\nconsistent with these findings , treatment with the tki pf-2341066 caused a significant reduction in tumor growth , a high level of apoptosis and cellular debris within the tumor using a xenograft animal model for hnscc .\nselective inhibitors of met / hgf signaling include humanized monoclonal antibodies for hgf and met , and small - molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors directed against met ( figure 1 ) .\nalthough their efficacy for treating a variety of solid tumors is increasingly recognized , we await results of preclinical and clinical trials for head and neck cancer that are ongoing .\nthe humanized antibody amg 102 shows high potency towards the mature and processed form of hgf with no detected effects on proteolytic activation of prohgf .\namg 102 interferes with met signaling , by competing with hgf for binding to the  chain of the met receptor . in phase\ni clinical studies in patients with advanced solid tumors , 70% of patients had a best response in terms of achieving stable disease [ 93 , 94 ] .\nimportantly , no antiamg 102 antibodies were detected and circulating hgf levels were dose dependent .\nanother promising clinical therapeutic is the one - armed 5d5 humanized antibody ( oa5d5/metmab ) directed against met .\nmetmab binds met with high affinity , preventing hgf binding , met phosphorylation , receptor internalization and downstream signaling events and has been shown to inhibit tumor growth in animal models by more than 95% [ 95 , 96 ] .\nmetmab is currently in phase i / ii human clinical trials in comparison with erlotinib in patients with nsclc ( http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ , identifier nct00854308 ) .\nfuture clinical trials will be required to determine the suitability of amg102 and metmab as either single agents or combinatorial therapeutics for treating hnscc patients .\nforetinib ( formerly xl880 ) is a tki whose primary targets include met and vegf , and to a lesser extent the platelet - derived growth factor ( pdgf ) receptor , ron , kit and tie2 rtks .\nforetinib recently completed phase ii clinical trials in head and neck patients ( http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ , identifier nct00725764 ) .\ninterim results suggest that after 12 months , 12 of 18 patients had stable disease .\na phase i dose - escalation study of the safety and pharmacokinetics of xl184 administered orally to patients with advanced malignancies ( showed that , on average , patients survived for more than 3 months with several up to 6 months while on treatment ) ( reviewed in ) . due to\nencouraging data from this study , a randomized phase iii trial of xl184 in hnscc patients was initiated to investigate xl184 as a first - line treatment ( compared with placebo ) for survival benefit to patients with hnscc ( http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ , identifier nct00704730 ) .\narq197 ( arqule ) is a nonatp - site competitive , selective small molecule inhibitor of the met intracellular region .\nalthough the mechanism of arq197 is presently unknown , the results of phase i trials suggest potential antiinvasive activity for this compound .\noverall , met , and hgf - targeted therapies have been well tolerated in clinical trials with negligible toxicities .\nhowever , it remains to be determined whether met is a better therapeutic target than hgf .\nclearly , in patients where met is activated by autocrine hgf secretion , both hgf and met targeted therapies may prove to be more efficacious treatment options .\nacquired resistance is likely the result of several mechanisms including ( 1 ) egfr mutations initially present as well as those acquired during therapy , ( 2 ) receptor independent activation of downstream signaling cascades , ( 3 ) cross - talk with other rtks and converging signaling pathways and ( 4 ) environmental factors including inflammatory agents and viral infection .\nresistance to cetuximab has been associated with the coexpression of the truncated egfr mutant , egfrviii with wild - type egfr .\negfrviii is the result of an in frame deletion of exons 27 spanning the extracellular ligand - binding domain .\nthe deletion results in a truncated egfr receptor that signals in a ligand - independent manner .\negfrviii expression has been detected in 42% of hnscc patient samples , and closely correlates with increased hnscc cell proliferation in vitro and increased tumor growth using in vivo xenograft models .\negfrviii preferentially activates the pi3k pathway instead of the ras / raf / mek pathway , which is activated by wild - type egfr . of particular interest to the therapeutic treatment of hnscc ,\negfrviii expression decreases the proliferative response of egfr expressing tumor cells to cetuximab treatment relative to vector control cells . in a recent study ,\negfrviii cells were shown to be resistant to the antiinvasive effects of cetuximab due to an increase in phosphorylation of stat3 rather than increased pi3k signaling .\negf - induced expression of the stat3 target gene hif1 was abolished by cetuximab in hnscc cells expressing wild - type egfr under hypoxic conditions , but not in egfrviii - expressing hnscc cells [ 102 , 103 ] .\nthese data suggest a role for egfrviii in mediating hnscc resistance to cetuximab .   despite egfrs critical role in the development of hnscc\n, clinical data indicate modest clinical benefits for locoregional control and survival of head and neck cancer patients treated with egfr - targeted therapies .\nhnscc patients resistant to cetuximab , often succumb to local tumor recurrence as well as regional and distant metastasis .\nthe addition of cetuximab to radiation therapy was reported to show improved locoregional disease control , progression - free survival , and overall survival in patients with locally advanced hnscc .\nhowever the data revealed a disproportionate benefit of cetuximab with radiotherapy to oropharyngeal cancer patients when compared to patients treated with hyperfractionated radiotherapy .\naccumulating evidence suggests that human papilloma virus ( hpv ) 16 status ( hpv+ ) is an important prognostic factor associated with a favorable outcome in a subset of head and neck cancers , including oropharyngeal and tonsilar cancers .\nhpv+ tumors tend to have unique genetic aberrations including decreased egfr expression , whereas increased igf-1r levels characteristic of hnscc appear to be independent of hpv status .\nclinically , hpv+ tumors are characterized by more favorable patient prognosis regarding disease - free survival as well as overall survival [ 104 , 105 ] , possibly as a result of increased genomic stability associated with global gene hypermethylation in hpv+ tumors .\nthus it will be interesting to determine whether hpv+ status explains some of the benefits derived from the addition of cetuximab to radiotherapy in this subset of hnscc patients . at present\n, there are few clinical indicators of which hnscc patients will most likely respond to egfr - targeted therapies .\naccordingly , strategies to optimize egfr - targeted therapy remain an active area of research .\nadditional mechanisms that result in egfr activation include activating mutations in downstream signaling components or cross - talk between different rtk pathways . activating mutations in the pi3ka oncogene\noccurs in 10% of hnscc tumors   whereas elevated levels of phosphorylated stat3 correlates with lymph node metastasis and poor patient prognosis [ 108110 ] .\nconversely , h - ras mutations are infrequent in hnscc cases ( less than 5% ) , although a higher incidence has been detected in asian populations and correlates with areca nut chewing [ 111 , 112 ] .\nmet signaling has been shown to contribute to resistance in cell lines derived from multiple tumor types including breast , gastric and lung .\nin one key study , nsclc with activating mutations in the egfr acquire resistance to the tki gefitinib and erlotinib , by amplification of the met gene to maintain akt and her3 signaling .\nthese studies underscore the role of cross - talk between rtks to preferentially signal through the pi3k - akt survival pathway as a mechanism for acquired drug resistance .\nthe relevance of met as a mechanism for escape from egfr - targeted therapy in head and neck cancers remains to be determined .\nhypoxia results in the transcriptional upregulation of met gene expression via hif1 in a number of tumors including head and neck , often downstream of egfr signaling . in normoxia\n, hydroxylation of 2 prolines in hif1 enables its binding to the von hippel - lindau tumor suppressor protein ( pvhl ) linking hif1 to a ubiquitin ligase complex . during hypoxia , minimal or no hydroxylation occurs enabling hif1 to avoid proteasomal degradation and\ndimerize to other hif family members such as hif1   and coactivators , to form an active transcriptional hif complex on the hypoxia response element ( hre ) of target genes such as met .\nthe ubiquitin ligase catalyzes polyubiquitination of hif1 targeting it for proteasomal degradation . under hypoxic conditions ,\nincreased met signaling directs the invasive growth program , enabling cells to invade more oxygenated tissues .\nsince met has been reported to promote invasive and angiogenic effects in the tumor microenvironment , the use of hgf / met inhibitors may afford a means of impairing tissue colonization as well as tumor vascularization in head and neck cancer patients .     \nstudies on other solid tumor types , most notably glioblastoma , indicate a role for igf-1r upregulation in resistance to egfr - targeted therapies .\nigf-1r mediates resistance to anti - egfr therapy in primary glioblastoma through the continued activation of the pi3k / akt survival pathway .\nthe apparent cooperation between igf-1r and egfr in promoting hnscc pathogenesis as well as resistance to egfr - targeted therapy , suggests an advantage to cotargeting these signaling axes for the treatment of head and neck cancers . to date , the effect of blocking oncogenic igf-1r and egfr signaling have been studied more extensively in breast cancer lines .\ntreatment with gefitinib and ag1024 , a tki for igf-1r reduced cell proliferation when used as single agents and showed an additive effect when used in combination [ 76 , 77 ] .\ntargeting igf-1r and egfr signaling is currently under evaluation in hormone - sensitive metastatic breast cancer using the igf-1r inhibitor osi-906 and the egfr tki erlotinib , although results are not yet available ( http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ , identifier nct01205685 ) .\nsimilarly , an exploratory study to assess the modulation of biomarkers in hnscc patients treated preoperatively with cetuximab and/or imc - a12 , a humanized antiigf-1r monoclonal antibody is currently underway ( http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ , identifier nct00617734 ) .\nthese studies will be critical for evaluating whether the use of antiigf-1r and egfr - targeted treatments will be more effective than single - agent modalities for treating patients with hnscc .\ntargeted therapies that block egfr , met , and igf-1r signaling in head and neck cancers continue to show promising results in preclinical studies and clinical trials .\nhowever , it is difficult to predict which patients are most likely to benefit from these therapeutics and potential side effects during long - term in vivo use . given the interplay between these rtk signaling pathways and the mediocre results obtained with monotherapy regimens thus far , clinical trials will be required to determine how egfr- , met- , and igf-1r - targeted therapies can be used in combination in order to definitively abrogate their common downstream oncogenic signaling networks .\nalthough gaps in our knowledge concerning the role of met and igf-1r in head and neck tumorigenesis , as well as acquired resistance to antiegfr therapies remain to be addressed , efforts to translate current information towards clinical applications continue to be impressive ."}

induced cell death through activation of enzymatic degradation , preservation of mitochondrial function , and inhibition of apoptotic cell death .\nclearly , mpp was found to significantly decrease the survival of dopaminergic neurons and increase the release of ldh into the culture medium .\nthe mpp toxicity involves its selective uptake by dopaminergic neurons through the dopamine transporter and inhibition of mitochondrial complex i activity with subsequent mitochondrial depolarization.14 in parallel , the use of jc-1 fluorescence dye in our current study showed that mpp significantly decreased the m of cultured cells as indicated by the decreasing red : green fluorescence ratio of jc-1 .\nsimilar mpp - induced reduction of m was reported in other in vitro disease models.15,16 mitochondrial damage has long been implicated in the death of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons in both pd patients and experimental models.17,18 staining of primary dopaminergic cultures with blue - fluorescent dapi nucleic acid stain showed that a significant number of the cells displayed features of apoptosis , most notably chromatin condensation , and fragmentation .\npreviously , tang et al19 and xu et al16 demonstrated that mpp caused apoptotic cell death in pc12 and sh - sy5y cells .\nthe mpp - induced apoptosis was reported to occur as the result of disruption of mitochondrial transmembrane potential and opening of the permeability transition pore.20 similar to our previous report,9 co - treatment of primary mesencephalic cell cultures with tq and mpp was found to protect dopaminergic neurons and decreased the release of ldh into the culture medium . since that time , no evidence in the literature has shown how tq protected dopaminergic neurons in the primary mesencephalic cell culture .\nstaining of cultures with lysotracker deep red showed that tq significantly increased the red fluorescence of the dye compared with mpp - treated cultures , indicating enhancement of the formation of many autophagolysosomes , the sites of lysosomal degradation , by tq .\nthis is supported by the findings of he and klionsky21 who correlated the fluorescent signals of lysotracker deep red to the upregulation of autophagy in zebrafish . increased red fluorescence of lysotracker deep red\nis attributed to the formation of many autophagosomes and autophagolysosomes that retain much dye as the result of increasing their acidification . using jc-1 fluorescent dye showed that tq significantly enhanced m as it increased the red : green fluorescence ratio of jc-1 compared with mpp - treated cultures .\nthe tq was similarly found to protect rat cortical neurons against ethanol- and a1 - 42-induced neurotoxicity through inhibition of mitochondrial membrane depolarization.22,23 counting of apoptotic nuclei using blue - fluorescent dapi nucleic acid stain indicated that tq decreased mpp - induced apoptotic cell death in primary mesencephalic cell cultures . in accordance ,\nullah et al22 reported that tq inhibited apoptotic cell death in ethanol - treated rat cortical neurons and attributed this effect of tq to the preservation of mitochondrial integrity .\nzhang et al24 reported that mitochondrial clearance protected cultured cortical neurons against ischemia - reperfusion - induced cell damage . in conclusion , correlating such results would therefore suggest that tq might activate a lysosomal degradative process in dopaminergic neurons , where clearance of damaged mitochondria results in reduced mitochondria - mediated apoptotic cell death .\nthis might raise the possibility of using tq as a potentially therapeutic intervention in pd patients .\nwhenever a manuscript contains material ( tables , figures , etc . ) which is protected by copyright ( previously published ) , it is the obligation of the author to obtain written permission from the holder of the copyright ( usually the publisher ) to reproduce the material in neurosciences .\nplease submit copies of the material from the source in which it was first published ."}

however , this significantly increases effort and processing time .\neffect of beta - blocker has to be factored in interpretation of ef by mdct .\nintroduction of new ct imaging methods , including dual source ct in clinical practice will overcome these two problems significantly owing to its two - fold increase in temporal resolution . also , newer options in mdct technology may partially obviate need for use of beta blockers .\nfunctional parameters derived from 2d - tte are compared with ct derived 3d volumetric data , which are not strictly comparable .\nour study design did not allow realistic comparison of mdct and echo lv volume data .\nit would be interesting to compare the same for assessment of accuracy of respective data .\nwith evolution of speckle - tracking 3d echography and new low radiation , high tr scanning such studies are possible .\nthe delay time between ct and echo and premedication with -blockers could have changed myocardial contraction and lv volumes as measured with the two methods . in the present\nset up , the number of patients referred to coronary angiography who will have volumetric data will be significantly smaller , limiting the application of this utility to a smaller offset of patients .\nthe radiation issue will certainly be an important consideration to use this technique in the larger group of patients .\nemerging new applications of echography in the form of 2d and 3d speckle - tracking echo certainly will have a greater role to play in the future noninvasive assessment of the myocardial function . in conclusion\nour study confirms useful complementary functional information in coronary cta datasets , using fully automated analysis software for rapid assessment of lvef .\nit is irrational to utilize mdct alone to assess lv function in clinical patients , given the radiation exposure involved .\nhowever , additional clinically useful information from a clinically indicated coronary ct examination with a lowest possible radiation dose is invaluable in patients known or suspected of ischemic heart disease .\nvalidating consistency of results with mri will further lend support to the use of mdct derived results .\ngoing forward with changing trends in ccta imaging , it is conceivable that number of patients undergoing cta with retrospective gating will substantially be reduced , thus limiting the functionality to a small group of patients ."}

organism systems , including in particular toxicity studies and an examination of their effects on beneficial normal microbiota . in spite of\nthe fact that herbal remedy is a mixture of many chemicals in unknown doses and might result in unpleasant side effects , many people believe that treatments that are natural are somehow magically safe and effective . \n aristolochia is used in traditional medicine for the treatment of various diseases [ 13 , 15 ] , including those associated with bacteria .\nthis study showed clearly that the excellent effect of aristolochia in treating such diseases is due to the toxic compound aa-1 .\nalthough aa-1 is highly effective in killing m. catarrhalis , it is ineffective against the other microorganisms tested .\nthis highlights the importance of m. catarrhalis in discovering the cellular target of aa-1 and the mechanism of aa-1 toxicity .\nthe widespread use of aristolochia is not sufficient to ensure that it is effective or even that it is safe .\ntherefore , hit - to - lead exploration is necessary to identify related compounds with low toxicity , low cost , and improved potency that can replace the use of the harmful crude plant material .\nit is impossible to ban the use of these remedies , especially in the rural areas in sudan and other african countries ; therefore , we strongly recommend educating the public of the risks versus the benefits of aristolochia and gradually replacing them with either economical new drugs or standardized extracts and homogenous batches of other plant material with known levels of safe active constituents .\nusing bioassay - guided fractionation technique , the present study directly linked the antibacterial activity of aristolochia bracteolata to the aa-1 .\nalthough aa-1 had strong activity against m. catarrhalis , it had a narrow spectrum of activity than expected based on the activity of the crude extract from which it was isolated or from its traditional usage .\nthis may be the result of synergism between different compounds in the complex extracts or may be due to placebo effect ."}

soluble vitamin with an unclear role in endometriosis .\nit is suggested that nuclear vitamin d receptors can have a regulatory role in inflammation and can be used as an index of cellular metabolic health . a study on vitamin d receptor gene polymorphism in endometriosis compared 132 infertile women with endometriosis with 132 fertile women , reporting no significant difference and suggesting that vitamin d receptor gene polymorphism does not play an important role in the pathogenesis of endometriosis . in some studies ,\nhigher plasma levels of 1 , 25-dihydroxy vitamin d3 and higher intake of dairy foods was associated with lower risk of endometriosis .\nconversely , another study compared serum vitamin d levels of 87 women with endometriosis with 53 women without endometriosis ; the mean serum levels of 1 , 25-dihydroxy vitamin d3 in women with and without endometriosis were 24.914.8 ng / ml and 20.411.8 , respectively ( p=0.05 ) and the study concluded that endometriosis is associated with higher serum levels of vitamin d .\na systematic review of 10 case - control studies and 1 cohort study on women s diet found that women with endometriosis had lower consumption of vegetables and omega-3 , and reported a significant association between diet and endometriosis .\nvitamin d binding protein ( dbp ) is a plasma glycoprotein that modulates immune and inflammatory responses and also controls transport of vitamin d metabolites and bone development . in a study\ncomparing 13 ectopic endometrial tissues and 6 normal endometrial tissues , vitamin d binding protein was significantly higher in the ectopic endometrial tissues ( p<0.05 ) .\na systematic review of research from 1946 to 2013 on vitamin d and endometriosis reported that women with endometriosis had higher serum levels of vitamin d binding protein .\nanother study compared serum and peritoneal levels of dbp in 26 women with endometriosis and 17 women with other benign gynecological conditions and reported that women with endometriosis had higher serum levels of dbp than in the control group .\na study comparing urinary levels of dbp in 57 women with endometriosis with levels in 38 controls found that the urinary level of dbp was significantly higher in patients with endometriosis .\na study using a rat model of endometriosis reported that treatment with vitamin d3 produced fibrosis and apoptosis in the stroma of tissues with endometriosis . a study on induced endometriosis in adult balb female mice reported that administration of 100 g / kg / day elocalcitol ( a vitamin d receptor agonist ) for 3 weeks reduced total lesion weight . because a relationship between vitamin d and endometriosis has been suggested by multiple studies , and since there has been no randomized clinical trial on endometriosis and vitamin d treatment in women , we decided to explore this relationship . in the present study on endometriosis - related pain\n, we found no significant difference in results of vitamin d treatment vs. placebo at 24 weeks after surgical diagnosis and treatment .\nvitamin d is a fat - soluble vitamin mainly produced in the body from food and supplements and cutaneous sun exposure .\nvitamin d deficiency is defined as serum 1.25-dihydroxy vitamin d3 levels under 20 ng / ml .\nit is reported in 52% of black and hispanic adolescents in boston and in 48% of girls in maine , and it is seen in 40100% of elderly men and women in the usa and europe . a study in germany found that 57% of people\n1879 years old were vitamin d deficient . the prevalence of vitamin d deficiency was reported to be 90% in healthy subjects in delhi , india . in a systematic review of 195 studies in 44 countries found that 37.3% of studies found that the mean serum vitamin d levels were less than 20 ng / ml .\nthe prevalence in pregnant turkish women was 81.4% . in a study of high school students in iran ,\nthe serum mean vitamin d level was 14.79.4 ng / ml . in another study in university students in shiraz , iran , 51.2% of female students had low serum levels of vitamin d . because the incidence of vitamin d deficiency in iran is high and we did not check the serum vitamin d levels in samples before intervention , it is possible that this dose and duration of vitamin d prescription was beneficial only for treatment of vitamin d deficiency and not endometriosis . in 1072 women attending an infertility center ,\nan in vitro study compared the effect of vitamin d3 on 25 human endometriosis stromal cell cultures ( ovarian endometrioma ) with the effect of vitamin d3 on culture of 20 endometrial samples of non - endometriosis women ; vitamin d3 inhibited proliferation , invasion , and pro - inflammatory cytokine production in endometriosis and reduced production of interleukin 6 and other inflammatory cytokines that stimulate adhesion of endometrial cells to the peritoneal cavity . a study on in vitro effects of vitamin d3 on human endometriosis stromal cells found that vitamin d3 significantly reduced interleukin 1 and tumor necrotizing factor- inflammatory responses , and also reported fewer endometrial stromal cells and reduced dna synthesis .\nthe study found significantly lower serum vitamin d3 levels in severe endometriosis compared to normal controls and patients with mild endometriosis . a study in italy investigated the effect of vitamin d on primary dysmenorrhea .\nthe samples were 40 women aged 1840 years old with 4 consecutive painful periods in the past 6 months .\nthey measured the serum levels of 25 hydroxy vitamin d with high - performance liquid chromatography .\nthen the women were randomized into a group of 20 women who received a single oral dose of 300 000 iu vitamin d ( cholecalciferol ) at 5 days before their next menstrual cycle and another group of 20 women received placebo .\nthere was a negative correlation between the baseline dysmenorrhea pain score and the level of 25 hydroxy vitamin d3 ( r=0.36 , p=0.2 ) .\nthe researchers found a significant reduction of dysmenorrhea pain in the vitamin d group in comparison with the placebo group in the next 2 menstruations ( p<0.01 ) .\nthey suggested this significant reduction of dysmenorrhea pain in vitamin d prescription group was due to decreased levels of pro - inflammatory cytokines and decreased the biological activity of prostaglandins .\nthe samples were not assessed for existing endometriosis . because low levels of serum vitamin d are common in healthy italian pre - menopausal women , these results only show that vitamin d was effective in relieving dysmenorrhea at least for 2 months after treatment in women with or without endometriosis and also in women with or without vitamin d deficiency .\nthere may be a relationship between vitamin d and pathogenesis of endometriosis , but in our study vitamin d was not effective in treatment of endometriosis - related pain .\nlarger clinical trials are needed to determine the possible effects of vitamin d supplementation in endometriosis treatment .\nthe first limitation of this study is the high prevalence of vitamin d deficiency in our country and worldwide , meaning that a high percentage of our samples may have had vitamin d deficiency , which may have affected the results of our research .\nfurther clinical trials are needed on the role of vitamin d treatment for endometriosis - related pain .\nfuture studies should assess the serum levels of vitamin d before enrolling study subjects , and those with vitamin d deficiency should be excluded .\nthe first limitation of this study is the high prevalence of vitamin d deficiency in our country and worldwide , meaning that a high percentage of our samples may have had vitamin d deficiency , which may have affected the results of our research .\nfurther clinical trials are needed on the role of vitamin d treatment for endometriosis -

infection of the root and periapical tissues .\nthe association of gutta - percha cones \n and root canal sealer has been traditionally used for this purpose . however , in the last \n decade , the dentin adhesive technology has been incorporated into the root canal filling \n techniques to reduce apical and coronal leakage by bonding to root canal walls .\netch -

absence of \n leakage ; ( inf.1 ) - leakage up to the 1 millimeter ; ( inf.2 ) \nleakage \n up to the 2 mm ; ( inf.3 )  leakage up to the 3 \n millimeter ; ( inf.5 )  leakage up to the 5 millimeter ; ( f.0 )  absence \n of gaps ; ( f.1 )  gaps type 1 ; ( f.2 ) - gaps types 1 and 2 .\nthe absence of leakage \n is associated with the absence of gap ; leakage up to the 1 millimeter \n is associated with type 1 ; and more extensive leakage is associated with types 1 \n and 2 frequency and type of gaps in the apical 5 mm of root canal fillings percentage of regions with gaps .\ntype 0 : absence of gaps ; type 1 : gaps between \n dentin and sealer ; type 2 gaps between sealer and cone the generalized linear model with poisson distribution ( table 1 ) found no difference between ah plus and ah primer ( p=0.497 ) in \n distribution of each type of gap , but they presented more type 0 regions \n ( p<0.001 ) .\nthere was a significant interaction between epiphany and the type of \n gap ( p<0.003 ) and for this group , there were more type 1 regions .\nbased on the findings of this study , the first null hypothesis could not be rejected . \n\nrecently some studies have shown similar results between ah plus and epiphany on apical \n sealing ability using the fluid filtration method .\nconsistent with these \n studies , our results indicate that the epiphany system is as effective as ah \n plus / gutta - percha in preventing microleakage based on the chemical tracer penetration \n analysis by sem and the use of epiphany primer does not reduce the microleakage of ah \n plus . nevertheless , other researches pointed out that the epiphany system provided the \n greatest resistance to the movement of fluids or dye leakage \n test , when compared to epoxy \n resin - based root canal sealers , but others have just indicated the opposite .\nthese apparent discrepancies can perhaps be explained by the \n methodology used and their variables .  \nthese results agree with those of previous studies in which , microleakage markers were \n used to evaluate apical sealing of the same endodontic sealers .\nthe tracer \n selected was agno3 , which may penetrate into dentinal tubules due to their \n physical and chemical characteristics including : concentration , smaller molecular size , \n its neutral ph , diffusion coefficient and service life up to 168 h post - preparation time of \n solution .\nanother reason for \n this choice is that metallic silver deposits may be observed by sem using back scattered \n electrons ( bse ) mode . on the other hand ,\nthe results of the current study disagree with the findings of \n shipper , et al .  \nan \n explanation for this would be that their studies have evaluated coronal and not apical \n bacterial leakage . indeed , coronal seal might be favorably influenced by photoactivation \n of the material which is unlikely to occur in the apical third .\nfurthermore , it is speculated that in in \n vivo studies ( dogs ) , the high release of calcium hydroxide ( 41.46 mg / l ) that \n would occur during the process of epiphany sealer solubilization , would make the medium \n alkaline , resulting in acceleration of the periapical tissue repair process .\nthis study has shown that the presence of apical gaps at the sealer / dentin or \n sealer / cone interfaces had an effect on apical microleakage .\nthe epiphany group \n presented more type 1 gaps than the other groups ( table \n 1 ) , rejecting the second null hypothesis .\nthese results corroborate with \n previous observation of gaps in the apical 4 mm of epiphany or ah plus - filled root \n canals .\nstress generated \n during the polymerization shrinkage of epiphany sealer has probably influenced the \n integrity loss at the sealer / dentin interface .\nin addition , the cavity configuration factor ( c - factor ) is \n highly unfavorable for adhesion inside root canals .\nmoreover , it is known that analysis of gap formation of \n vertically sectioned root filled teeth hides the risk of artifacts during sectioning . \n\ntherefore , in this study , the sections were made at low speed under water cooling .\nthe \n resin -

displaying hydrophilic characteristics ( contact angle of 22 ) , this coating was in fact reported to reduce adhesion of s. epidermidis and e. coli by several orders of magnitude compared to the unmodified glass slide .\nsimilarly , adhesion of s. aureus on ti foils functionalized with hyaluronic acid - catechol was lower than on pristine substrates .\nbased on ha antiadhesive properties , a novel ha - based hydrogel has been recently proposed , in order to protect implanted biomaterials in orthopaedics , trauma and dental surgery from bacterial colonization 42 ; this fast - resorbable hydrogel coating , composed of covalently linked hyaluronan and poly - d , l - lactide (  defensive antibacterial coating  , dac , novagenit srl , mezzolombardo , italy ) , has been found to have a synergistic antibiofilm activity with various antibacterials and able to be effectively manually spread onto the surface of various biomaterials commonly used in orthopaedics , trauma and dental surgery 43 ( fig .\n1 ) . the ability to completely cover even sand - blasted titanium surface and resist scraping has in fact been confirmed by scanning electron microscopy ( sem ) analysis ( cf .\nthis is an important requirement in order to reduce the exposed surface of a biomaterial , thus creating a uniform coating of the surface and leaving no pores or cracks that could eventually be colonized by planktonic bacteria . in unpublished experiments ( novagenit srl , data on file ) , in order to evaluate dac ability to prevent bacterial adhesion , 200 mg of hydrogel were homogenously spread on the surface of sterile titanium discs .\nhydrogel - coated substrates and uncoated substrates ( controls ) were then placed into sterile 6-wells polystyrene plates and overlaid with a standardized inoculum ( 10 cfu / ml ) of bacterial cells for 15 , 30 , 60 and 120 minutes .\nthe remaining adhered cells were detached by adding a solution of 0.1% w / v dithiothreitol ( dtt ) ( sigma - aldrich , milan , italy ) to each well and stirring for 15 minutes at room temperature .\nthen , 100 l of each sample were plated onto tryptic soy agar ( tsa ; merck , darmstadt , germany ) and incubated at 37c for 24 hours for cfu counts .\nthe results showed that the adhesion density of s. aureus on titanium discs pre - treated with dac , was significantly lower than adhesion on untreated controls at each time point ( fig .\n2 ) . in particular , reductions of adhered bacteria equal to 86.8% , 80.4% ,\n74.6% and 66.7% vs untreated discs were observed after 15 , 30 , 60 and 120 minutes of incubation , respectively , while an increase of adhesion density during time was observed for both control and pre - treated discs ( fig .\nfurther analyses were conducted to show the ability to dislodge previously adhered bacteria ; to this aim , titanium discs were placed into sterile 6-wells polystyrene plates and overlaid with a standardized inoculum ( 10 cfu / ml ) of bacterial cells in order to allow the adhesion of bacterial cells .\nafterwards , 200 mg of hydrogel were spread on the surface of contaminated titanium discs in order to remove previously adhered bacteria .\nnon - adherent bacteria were removed by rinsing with sterile saline , while the remaining adhered cells were detached by adding 0.1% dtt as previously described .\nthen , 100 l of each sample were plated onto tsa and incubated at 37c for 24 hours for cfu counts .\nthe results showed that dac hydrogel treatment of discs reduced the amount of adhered bacteria in respect to control discs after 15 , 30 , 60 and 120 minutes of 84.0% , 72.8% , 72.3% and 64.3% , respectively ( fig.4 ) .\nonce again , an increase of adhesion density during time was observed for both control and treated discs ( fig .\ndac hydrogel showed similar or superior in vitro activity , compared to various antibacterials and a synergistic activity when used in combination ( fig .\nwere grown on chrome - cobalt devices in 6-wells polystyrene plates containing tsb for 24 hours at 37c .\nthen , growth medium was removed together with non - adherent bacteria and new broth added .\nthe plates were incubated at 37c in ambient air , until a visible biofilm was obtained .\ngentamycin and vancomycin were tested at a final concentration of 20 mg / ml . similarly , when mixed with the hydrogel , 60 mg of gel powder were reconstituted with 1 ml of water for injections containing gentamicin or vancomycin at 20 mg / ml concentration .\namount of biofilm at each time was determined before hydrogel and antibiotic agents addition and after 0.5 , 1 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 24 and 48 hours of incubation by a spectrophotometric assay .\nin particular , at each time , broth was removed and biofilm stained with crystal violet .\nafter elution of the stain from implants with absolute ethanol , the amount of biofilm was quantified by reading optical density ( o.d . ) at a wavelength of 595 nm against blank ( consisting of ethanol ) .\namount of biofilm at each time was compared with that formed on the same type of implant before treatment .\neach assay was performed in duplicate and repeated for three times . at each time point , both for gentamycin and vancomycin showed only a partial inhibition of biofilm formation ( ca .\n40 - 50% for vancomycin ) , with minor difference between the two studied microorganisms . on the other side ,\n50% in comparison to the untreated controls , while a combination of the hydrogel with either antibacterial resulted in a larger reduction of biofilm formation ( approximately 75 to 80% in comparison with untreated controls ) .\nboth these experimental studies show the ability of the dac hydrogel to significantly reduce bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation of common bacterial pathogens , thus potentially providing an effective protection of the implant ; however , these data also point out how , in the clinical setting , in the absence of an adequate immune response from the host and/or of sufficient local levels of antibiotics , a passive antiadhesive coating 18 like ha can be overcome by the remaining bacteria in a time - dependent manner .\nfor this reason , any passive antiadhesive coating of implants 44 should probably better be seen as a tool to reduce and delay bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation to a variable degree , also depending on the local environment , the contaminating bacterial species and initial bacterial load ; this may still provide an additional advantage to the host 's cells to first colonize the implanted biomaterial and win the competition with the microorganisms that may eventually be present , thus contributing to reduce the occurrence of implant - related infections .\nseveral clinical local applications of ha to reduce the impact of biofilm - related infections have been reported , in different clinical settings , with favourable results and no adverse events .\n45 recently described topical administration of hyaluronic acid in children with recurrent or chronic middle ear inflammations and chronic adenoiditis . in this prospective , single - blind , randomised controlled study , otoscopy , tympanometry and pure - tone audiometry in children which received the daily topical administration of normal 0.9% sodium chloride saline solution ( control group ) or 9 mg of sodium hyaluronate in 3 ml of a 0.9% sodium saline solution was performed .\nthe final analysis was based on 116 children ( 49.1% boys ; mean age , 62.9  17.9 months ) : 58 in the control group and 58 in the study group . at the end of follow - up ,\nthe prevalence of patients with impaired otoscopy was significantly lower in the study group ( p value = 0.024 ) compared to baseline but not in the control group . in comparison with baseline ,\nthe prevalence of patients with impaired tympanometry at the end of the follow - up period was significantly lower in the study group ( p value = 0.047 ) but not in the control group .\nthe reduction in the prevalence of patients with conductive hearing loss ( chl ) ( p value = 0.008 ) and those with moderate chl ( p value = 0.048 ) was significant in the study group , but not in the control group .\nthe mean auditory threshold had also significantly improved by the end of treatment in the study group ( p value = 0.004 ) but not in the control group .\nseveral studies have also reported the beneficial effect of topical ha in chronic urinary tract infections ( uti ) .\nin contrast to traditional antibiotic therapy , which aims at eradicating pathogens , treatment with ha targets bacterial adherence to the bladder mucosa with the presumption that a damaged glycosaminoglycan mucous layer facilitates bacterial adherence and therefore recurrent uti 46 . among others 47 , 48 ,\nlipovac and colleagues evaluated the efficacy of nine ha bladder instillations over 6 months in 20 women with a history of recurrent uti .\ntheir status was assessed prospectively but compared with a retrospective review of patients ' charts .\nthe number of infections per year per patient was significantly reduced ( from 4.990.92 to 0.560.82 , p>0.001 ) and the mean time to recurrence ( from 76.724.6 to 178.325.5 days , p>0.001 ) was prolonged significantly .\nnevertheless 65% of treated patients were free of recurrences until the end of study ( 47.6 weeks ) 49 .\nwere able to provide a higher level of evidence by reporting a prospective , randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled study , in which a significant reduction of 77% ( p<0.0002 ) in the uti rate per patient per year versus placebo was observed at the end of the study .\nmoreover , mean time to uti recurrence was significantly prolonged ( 185.278.7 versus 52.733.4 days , p<0.001 ) after treatment compared with placebo .\noverall urinary symptoms and quality of life measured by questionnaires significantly improved compared with placebo 50 .\nvery recently a multicentre european study confirmed the efficacy of intravesical administration of combined hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulphate ( cs ) for the treatment of female recurrent urinary tract infections 51 .\na total of 276 adult women received intravesical administration of ha+cs or standard of care ( antimicrobial/ immunoactive prophylaxis/ probiotics / cranberry ) . at follow - up ,\n181 patients treated with ha+cs and 95 patients treated with standard of care from 7 centres were available .\nthe crude and adjusted ors ( 95% ci ) for bacteriologically confirmed recurrence within 12 months were 0.77 ( 0.46 to 1.28 ) and 0.51 ( 0.27 to 0.96 ) , respectively .\nstudies were also undertaken to determine the effect on clinical variables , sub - gingival bacteria and local immune response brought about by application of hyaluronan - containing gels in early wound healing after scaling and root planing ( srp ) in dentistry 52 , 53 . in the study reported from eick et al .\nthe exclusion criteria were : antibiotics intake in the 6 months before the study , periodontal treatment received during the previous year , pregnancy , nursing , smoking , chronic diseases such as diabetes mellitus or rheumatoid arthritis , and allergy to ingredients in the drug . in the test group ( n=17 ) , a 0.8% hyaluronan - containing gels ( ha ) was introduced into all periodontal pockets during srp and a 0.2% ha gel was applied by the patients onto the gingival margin twice daily during the following 2 weeks while the control group ( n=17 ) was treated with srp only ; no placebo was used . probing depth ( pd ) and clinical attachment level ( cal )\nwere recorded at baseline and after 3 and 6 months , and subgingival plaque and sulcus fluid samples were taken for microbiologic and biochemical analysis . in both groups , pd and cal\nthe changes in pd and the reduction of the number of pockets with pd5 mm were significantly higher in the test group after 3 ( p=0.014 and 0.021 ) and 6 ( p=0.046 and 0.045 ) months .\nsix months after srp , the counts of treponema denticola were significantly reduced in both groups ( both p=0.043 ) , as were those of campylobacter rectus in the test group only ( p=0.028 ) .\nalthough to date no surface modification has been reported to be able to fully prevent bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation 55 , available data show that hyaluronic acid has a proven in vitro antiadhesive / antibiofilm effect against some of the most common pathogens and it has been used safely , alone or in combination with other polymers , with satisfactory results in different conditions associated with biofilm - related chronic infections .\nclinical data in various applications , including dentistry , urology , wound management , dermatology and orthopedics , allow to consider the potential use of ha as a protective coating barrier of implants particularly safe and feasible on a large scale basis .\nwhile antibacterial coatings to mitigate the occurrence of implant- and biofilm - related infections are regarded as one of the most needed technology , currently only few and insufficient options are available for clinical use in orthopedics and trauma surgery 18 .\nconsidering the pathogenesis of implant - related infections , any protection offered by a fully biocompatible antiadhesive barrier , like ha and some of its derivatives , could be extremely useful to reduce the tremendous burden of implant - related infections .\non the other hand , it should be noted that hyaluronic acid as a passive protective barrier has some limits . among others ,\nthe antiadhesive / antibiofilm effect is limited and may vary , depending on the type of the microorganism , the bacterial load , the local environment , etc .\n; moreover , ha protection may be neutralized by the possible ability of some bacteria to produce hyaluronidase , an enzyme that catalyzes the degradation of hyaluronic acid 56 , while collagen and hyaluronan may even become possible ligands for microbial attachment in particular situations 57 , 58 .\nto overcome at least some of these limits , possible loading of hyaluronic - based hydrogels with antibiotics is technically feasible and has been proposed by different authors 59 - 62 , being a possible option for future developments and large scale clinical applications , provided that regulatory requirements can be met ."}

the - counter sell of antibiotics often in improper dose .\nthe limitation of this study is that this is a single center study for only three - month period in a tertiary care hospital in central india . to reflect the trend of infections caused by mdr and xdr strains of bacteria in the region , a multicenter study involving all types of healthcare setups for a minimum period of one year\nthere is paucity of data regarding mdros in health care setup not only in india but also worldwide .\nunless and until multidrug resistant organisms are detected and their incidence is known , the strategies for their control can not be adopted properly in healthcare setup . hence , detection , prevention of transmission of mdros by following infection control practices , antimicrobial surveillance , and stewardship are need of the hour .\nmisuse and overuse of antibiotics , over - the - counter selling of antibiotics without prescription to common people , must be stopped by strict implementations of rules and regulations .\nwe hereby conclude that early detection and close monitoring of mdr , xdr , or even pdr bacterial strains must be started by all clinical microbiology laboratories to reduce the menace of antimicrobial resistance which is now a global problem ."}

{"lay_summary": " objectives : the aim of this study was to investigate the impact of asymptomatic vertebral fractures on the quality of life in older women as part of the sao paulo ageing & health study.methods:this study was a cross - sectional study with a random sample of 180 women 65 years of age or older with or without vertebral fractures . \n the quality of life questionnaire of the european foundation for osteoporosis was administered to all subjects . \n anthropometric data were obtained by physical examination , and the body mass index was calculated . \n lateral thoracic and lumbar spine x - ray scans were obtained to identify asymptomatic vertebral fractures using a semi - quantitative method.results:women with asymptomatic vertebral fractures had lower total scores [ 61.4(15.3 ) vs. 67.1(14.2 ) , p  =  0.03 ] and worse physical function domain scores [ 69.5(20.1 ) vs. 77.3(17.1 ) , p  =  0.02 ] for the quality of life questionnaire of the european foundation for osteoporosis compared with women without fractures . \n the total score of this questionnaire was also worse in women classified as obese than in women classified as overweight or normal . \n high physical activity was related to a better total score for this questionnaire ( p  =  0.01 ) . likewise , lower physical function scores were observed in women with higher body mass index values ( p<0.05 ) and lower physical activity levels ( p<0.05 ) . \n generalized linear models with gamma distributions and logarithmic link functions , adjusted for age , showed that lower total scores and physical function domain scores for the quality of life questionnaire of the european foundation for osteoporosis were related to a high body mass index , lower physical activity , and the presence of vertebral fractures ( p<0.05).conclusion : vertebral fractures are associated with decreased quality of life mainly physical functioning in older community - dwelling women regardless of age , body mass index , and physical activity . \n therefore , the results highlight the importance of preventing and controlling asymptomatic vertebral fractures to reduce their impact on quality of life among older women . ", "article": "health - related quality of life ( hrqol ) is a multidimensional concept that defines a person 's health based on specific aspects , such as physical , emotional , and social functioning and general welfare ( 1 ) .\nthe assessment of hrqol consists of an evaluation of the degree to which these aspects are decreased by symptoms , incapacities , and limitations caused by disease ( 2 ) .\nthe assessment of hrqol has been used as a measure complementary to bone mineral density to evaluate and monitor the burden of osteoporosis on a patient 's daily life ( 3 ) .\nthere are several instruments that can be used to assess the quality of life of individuals with osteoporosis , including the osteoporosis assessment questionnaire , the quality of life questionnaire for osteoporosis ( optqol ) , the osteoporosis quality of life questionnaire , and the questionnaire of the european foundation for osteoporosis ( qualeffo ) ( 4 - 7 ) .\nthe qualeffo , a specific tool used to evaluate subjects with vertebral fractures and that includes questions on pain , physical functioning , social functioning , general health perception and mental functioning , has been shown to be repeatable and consistent ( 7 - 8 ) .\nvertebral fractures are the most frequent osteoporotic fractures , occurring in at least 30% of the elderly population ( 9 ) , and have important clinical implications ( 10 - 14 ) .\nthese fractures are associated with increased risks of new osteoporotic fractures and mortality , especially in older women ( 10 - 11 ) .\nonly one - third of vertebral fractures are symptomatic ; therefore , patients may be unaware of their presence .\nindeed , in studies based on the radiographic screening of populations , the incidence of all vertebral fractures has been estimated to be three times higher than the incidence of hip fractures , and only 30% of people with vertebral fractures were found to have received medical attention ( 12 ) . women with vertebral fractures can also experience decreased hrqol due to physical limitations and psychosocial disabilities ( 13 - 14 ) .\nsome studies have assessed the impact of vertebral fractures on hrqol in older women in many countries ( 15,16 ) , but few such epidemiological studies have been conducted in brazil .\nmoreover , most of the studies conducted in this country have been performed in ambulatory or institutionalized individuals ( 17,18 ) .\ntherefore , this study evaluated the impact of vertebral fractures on the quality of life of healthy , community - dwelling women aged 65 years or older using the qualeffo .\nthis study was performed using the framework of the so paulo ageing & health study ( spah ) , which was a population - based , cross - sectional study ( 9 ) .\nthe inclusion and exclusion criteria were the same as those of the core study ( 9 ) .\nall of the individuals were apparently healthy and showed no evidence of malabsorption , chronic diarrhea , hepatic disease , severe chronic diseases , or cancer .\ncurrent or previous bisphosphonate use was also an exclusion criterion ( 9 ) . quality of life was assessed through individual interviews using the validated qualeffo with 41 questions covering five domains : pain ( 5 questions ) , physical functioning ( 17 questions ) , social functioning ( sevn questions ) , general health perception ( three questions ) , and mental functioning ( nine questions ) ( 7 ) .\nthe total score for each domain was obtained by summing the scores of all questions for that domain and submitting this sum to a linear transformation to a scale ranging from 0 to 100 , where 0 corresponds to the worst hrqol and 100 to the best hrqol .\nradiographs of the lumbar and thoracic spine centered on l2 and t7 , respectively , were obtained for all participants , with 40 \" between the tube and the film .\nthe identification of vertebral fractures was performed by two individuals with experience in the field of analyzing vertebral fractures .\nthey were blinded to each other 's assessments , and when the results conflicted , a consensus between the two individuals was reached .\nthe agreement between the assessments of the two individuals was 96% , and the kappa coefficient was 0.82 .\neach identified fractured vertebra was assigned a grade based on the genant sq scale , where mild ( grade 1 ) corresponds to a 20

40% in any height .\nthe height ( without shoes ) of each participant was measured to the nearest 0.1 cm with a wall - mounted stadiometer .\nthe weight of each participant ( without shoes and wearing only light clothing ) was measured to the nearest 0.25 kg using a double - beam balance scale .\nthe body mass index ( bmi ) was calculated by dividing the participant 's weight ( kilograms ) by her height squared ( square meters ) , and the subjects were categorized using the following cutoff points proposed by the world health organization ( who ) : normal weight  =  bmi<25 ; overweight  =  25bmi<30 ; and obese  =  bmi30 ( 20 ) .\ninformation regarding health , lifestyle and risk factors for osteoporosis / fractures was obtained through individual interviews .\nwomen who had had two or

, walks irregularly , and gardens ; and ( c ) high , performs regular physical activity aside from her daily routine at least twice a week for 30 min ( 22 ) .\nregarding concomitant diseases , those mentioned at the time of the interview were noted , as well as those diagnosed during the physical examination . systemic arterial hypertension ( sah ) was defined as a history of hypertension with the use of antihypertensive drugs or a systolic blood pressure>140 mmhg and/or diastolic blood pressure>90 mmhg , which was measured with a standard sphygmomanometer with the subject seated for at least 5 minutes prior to the measurement ( 23 ) .\nparticipants taking oral hypoglycemic agents or insulin or those with fasting blood glucose levels126 mg / dl were considered to be diabetic ( 24 ) .\nthe bmd was measured by dual x - ray absorptiometry ( dxa ) using hologic densitometry equipment ( hologic inc .\nbedford , ma , usa , discovery model ) in the following regions : lumbar spine ,

densitometry ) , the lowest t - score among the three sites ( lumbar spine , femoral neck , and total femur ) was used to classify each participant as having osteoporosis , osteopenia , or normal bone density .\nthus , the individuals with t - scores that were 2.5 standard deviations or more below the scores for healthy controls for the peak bone mass were diagnosed with osteoporosis , individuals with t - scores between 2.5 and 1.0 standard deviations below the scores for healthy controls were diagnosed with osteopenia , and individuals with t - scores greater than 1.0 standard deviation below

, grouped based on the presence ( vertebral fracture ) or absence of vertebral fractures ( no vertebral fracture ) , are shown in table 1 .\nthere were no significant differences with respect to the mean bmi or the percentage of caucasian individuals between the groups ( p>0.05 ) ( table 1 ) .\nregarding the bmi classification , 22.8% and approximately 38% of the subjects were classified as normal and obese , respectively , with no significant difference between the two groups ( p>0.05 ) .\na tendency of older age in the vertebral fracture group was observed ( p  =  0.057 ) .\nthe frequencies of hypertension ( p  =  0.224 ) , diabetes ( p  =  0.672 ) , hypothyroidism ( p  =  0.723 ) , and two or more concomitant diseases ( p  =  0.216 ) and the average number of medications used ( p  =  0.497 ) were comparable between the groups .\ninterestingly , the vertebral fracture group contained a higher frequency of women defined as chronic fallers than the no vertebral fracture group ( 64.7 vs. 32.1% , p  =  0.017 ) .\nas expected , the vertebral fracture group had a higher frequency of osteoporosis ( 73.2 vs. 51.1% , p  =  0.012 ) and a lower frequency of osteopenia ( 19.5 vs. 38.1% , p  =  0.027 ) than the no vertebral fracture group .\nthe results for each domain of the qualeffo and the total qualeffo score in both groups are shown in table 2 .\nthe total qualeffo score was lower in the vertebral fracture group than in the no vertebral fracture group [ 61.4 ( 15.4 ) vs. 67.1 ( 14.2 ) , p  =  0.031 ] .\nlikewise , the physical function domain score of the qualeffo was worse in the vertebral fracture group compared with the no vertebral fracture group [ 69.5 ( 20.1 ) vs. 77.3 ( 17.1 ) , p  =  0.018 ] .\nno difference was observed regarding the other qualeffo domains ( pain , social functioning , health perception , and mental functioning ) ( table 2 ) .\nthe total qualeffo score was inversely related to bmi ( rs  =  -0.21 ,\np  =  0.005 ) and weight ( rs  =  -0.22 , p  =  0.009 ) .\nthe total qualeffo score was worse in women classified as obese than in those classified as overweight or normal [ 61.7 ( 15.4 ) vs. 66.4 ( 13.8 ) vs. 70.8 ( 13.5 ) , respectively , p  =  0.008 ] .\na lower total qualeffo score was also observed in women with low physical activity than in those with moderate or high activity [ 51.8 ( 19.1 ) vs. 64.8 ( 14.3 ) vs. 70.3 ( 13.2 ) , respectively , p  =  0.010 ] ( table 3 ) .\nsimilarly , the physical function domain of the qualeffo was inversely related to the bmi ( rs  =  -0.24 , p  =  0.001 ) . in this domain , women classified as obese were found to have lower scores than women classified as overweight or normal [ 70.7 ( 19.3 ) vs. 76.1 ( 16.1 ) vs. 81.4 ( 17.4 ) , respectively , p  =  0.002 ] . finally , lower scores for the physical function domain were found among women with low physical activity compared with those with moderate or high activity [ 49.6(24.9 ) vs. 75.1(18.1 ) vs. 80.7(12.6 ) , respectively , p  =  0.002 ] ( table 3 ) . a generalized linear model with gamma distributions and logarithmic link functions was developed to identify patient characteristics that were related to the total and physical function domain scores of the qualeffo .\nvariables with a p<0.10 in the univariate analysis ( age , bmi classification , physical activity , diabetes , presence of at least one fracture ) were included as independent variables .\nthe presence of obesity was negatively associated with the total qualeffo score ( p  =  0.001 ) .\na high physical activity level was positively associated with the total qualeffo score ( p  =  0.001 ) .\nthe presence of at least one fracture was associated with a worse total qualeffo score , independent of age , bmi classification and physical activity level ( p  =  0.030 ) .\nlikewise , the presence of at least one fracture was negatively associated with the physical function domain , independent of these same variables ( p  =  0.041 ) ( table 4 ) .\nthis study was the first study conducted in brazil that specifically assessed the impact of vertebral fractures on the quality of life in older , community - dwelling women using a specific questionnaire . in this study\n, we demonstrated that the presence of vertebral fractures in this population is related to worse hrqol , particularly with respect to physical functioning .\nthe major advantage of the present study is the homogenous selection of community - dwelling women , unlike previous studies in which individuals were recruited from clinics or from populations included in clinical trials .\nstudies showing worse hrqol in patients with vertebral fractures have been published in several countries ( 15,16 ) .\nthere are only two studies evaluating the hrqol in patients with vertebral fractures in brazil , but neither was specific to older community - dwelling individuals ( 17,18 ) .\nthe first of these two other studies was performed in 55 outpatient women divided into three groups : 1- women without osteoporosis , 2- women without osteoporosis and no vertebral fractures , 3- women with osteoporosis and vertebral fractures . in that study ,\nthe quality of life was assessed with the sf-36 , and no difference was found among the three groups .\none of the reasons for this finding was the inclusion of only women who were able to perform the spirometric tests , resulting in the exclusion of women in worse conditions who would most likely belong to the fracture group ( 17 ) .\nlater , de oliveira et al . evaluated the quality of life in ambulatory women with osteoporosis and found similar results for those who had vertebral fractures and those who did not .\nhowever , that study was not designed to assess the impact of vertebral fractures on quality of life , and the number of women with fractures was too small to enable an accurate assessment ( 18 ) .\nthe assessment of quality of life in relation to the qualeffo pain domain was similar in women with and without vertebral fractures in our study .\nsome studies have found that the pain domain is worse in women with fractures ; however , the patients included in those studies were recruited based on clinical symptoms related to fractures and were compared with those without back pain ( 28 ) .\nvertebral fractures do not always manifest with symptoms and are often diagnosed based on radiographs taken for other reasons .\nevaluated the chest radiographs of older women who had been hospitalized for several causes , and they found that only a few of the vertebral fractures present had been previously identified by clinicians ( 29 ) .\nindeed , in our previous study performed in brazil , 29.4% subjects had vertebral fractures , and none of these patients had prior knowledge of their vertebral fractures ( 9 ) .\nas observed in other studies , the mental function , social function , and health perception domains were not significantly different between women with and without fractures ( 30 ) .\nthe relatively small differences between the groups with and without fractures may be the result of the acceptance of poor health conditions due to the natural expectation of physical decline in older women ( 13 ) . in our study\n, we found that obesity and low physical activity were associated with lower quality of life .\nother authors have reported that higher bmi and a sedentary lifestyle are factors that influence the quality of life in patients with osteoporosis ( 18,31 - 32 ) .\nit is important to highlight the fact that both obesity and a sedentary lifestyle are preventable factors and can be controlled by a change in lifestyle .\nsome authors observed that physical exercise is associated with a better quality of life ( 33 ) and have demonstrated that a home exercise program for women with vertebral fractures ( 60 min / d , 3x / week for 12 months ) significantly improves the hrqol ( 34 ) . a study performed at our institution in osteoporosis patients showed that an exercise program improved the quality of life in these women ( 35 ) .\ntherefore , our data reinforce the need for all older women to be advised about the benefits of exercise .\nthese women should be encouraged to exercise regularly to reduce their bmi and improve their general welfare .\nour study is the first in brazil to conduct a thorough assessment of the relationship between quality of life and vertebral fractures .\nan important characteristic of this study was the use of standardized and reliable instruments for both the vertebral fracture assessment ( genant semi - quantitative method ) and the hrqol assessment ( qualeffo ) .\nalthough the qualeffo has not been validated in brazil , which is a limitation of the present study , this tool is the most frequently used for assessing quality of life in osteoporosis and was recommended for the investigation of vertebral fracture subjects in multicentric studies that included centers in brazil ( 36 ) .\nthis questionnaire is more sensitive in detecting differences between groups , and it provides a better discrimination between individuals with and without vertebral fractures compared with generic hrqol instruments , such as the sf-36 , particularly with respect to physical functioning , which is significantly affected in these patients ( 8) . in conclusion , this study demonstrated the negative impact of vertebral fractures on the quality of life in older women , independent of other factors such as bmi and physical activity .\nalthough the clinical relevance of vertebral fractures is well established , these results are important for assessing the burden of this disease and reinforce the need to reduce the underdiagnosis and undertreatment of these fractures . the results of this study also highlight the need for awareness of the importance of maintaining proper weight and promoting changes in lifestyle through physical activity and dietary control .\nthis study was supported by fundao de amparo e pesquisa do estado de so paulo ( fapesp ) # 03/09313 - 0 ; conselho nacional de cincia e tecnologia ( cnpq ) # 305691/2006 - 6 ( rmrp

", "article": "the majority of women with menorrhagia , postcoital bleeding , intermenstrual bleeding , or postmenopausal bleeding ultimately undergo diagnostic hysteroscopy with endometrial sampling as part of their assessment , particularly if symptoms persist or pelvic imaging suggests a uterine abnormality .\ndilatation and curettage ( d&c ) has been widely considered to be the method of choice for obtaining endometrial samples for histopathological evaluation\n. however , the needs for admission and general anesthesia and their associated costs have made this option less favorable . in the outpatient setting , endometrial sampling is an effective and acceptable method for obtaining endometrial samples for histopathological assessment [ 3 , 4 ] .\ninadequate sampling is more problematic in postmenopausal women , for whom up to 68% of endometrial samples are reported to be inadequate . in our institution , the only sampling tool available to perform the outpatient sampling procedure is the uterine explora model i - mx120 ( http://www.coopersurgical.com/ ) ( figure 1 ) .\nin addition , the device is sterile and disposable ( one - time use ) .\nthe advantages of using explora rather than d&c as a sampling device include a reduction in hospitalization costs , extra convenience for the patient and physician , and the minimal complications of the procedure .\nthe purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of the explora model i tool with the conventional d&c technique for obtaining adequate endometrial samples that are capable of providing specific and informative histopathologic diagnoses .\nafter obtaining the approval of our institutional review board , all endometrial samples received at the histopathology department in king khalid university hospital ( kkuh , riyadh , ksa ) between january 2007 and december 2010 were included in this study . a total of 1270 endometrial samples were included ( table 1 ) .\ntwo hundred seventy - four samples ( 21.6% ) were obtained by conventional d&c in the surgical theater , while the remaining 996 samples ( 78.4% ) were obtained by senior obstetrics and gynecology residents who used a standardized biopsy technique in the outpatient procedure rooms . during the usage of the explora model\ni , the syringe provided with the instrument was used to create a negative pressure , and the explora was rotated as it was withdrawn . after withdrawal , the tip was cut off , and the tissue was placed in 10% buffered formalin saline fixative and was sent for pathological examination .\nthe pathologists who interpreted the endometrial samples were blinded to the instrument or method used to obtain the samples .\nan inadequate sample was defined as consisting of only blood , cervical mucus , endocervical epithelium , or blood with fragments of endometrial glands or stroma insufficient for histopathological assessment and diagnosis .\nthe age , gravidity , parity , menstrual history , uterine size , hysteroscopy findings ( when available ) , and the presence or absence of any cervical abnormality were recorded on the request forms , which were reviewed by the investigators . for each of the two methods used ( explora model i and d&c ) , the numbers and percentages of inadequate samples and age group clustering were calculated and statistically analyzed .\nof the 1270 endometrial samples obtained , 253 samples ( 19.9% ) were scored as inadequate . of these samples ,\nthe explora sampler was used to collect 224 samples ( 88.5% ) , whereas 29 samples ( 11.5% ) were obtained by d&c ( figure 2 ) .\nthus , the insufficient tissue percentage was higher with the explora ( 17.6% ) than with d&c ( 2.2% ) , which was a statistically significant difference ( p < 0.0001 )\n. age group clustering ( i.e. , numbers of premenopausal and postmenopausal women ) of inadequate sample results was also calculated ( figure 3 ) . of the 253 inadequate samples ,\n82.6% were from women 45 years of age and older ( i.e. , postmenopausal ) compared to 17.4% in premenopausal women ; the age difference was significant ( p < 0.0001 ) .\nthe detection rates of endometrial hyperplasia and carcinoma using both methods were assessed and calculated .\nof the 73 samples with a diagnosis of endometrial hyperplasia , 50 ( 68.5% ) were diagnosed by d&c , and 23 ( 31.5% ) were diagnosed using the explora sampler .\nhowever , of the 18 samples with a diagnosis of endometrial cancer , the rates of detection were similar between the two methods .\nendometrial sampling for the evaluation of dysfunctional uterine bleeding and the diagnosis of endometrial hyperplasia and carcinoma and other indications remains one of the most commonly performed gynecological procedures [ 14 ] . in recent years\n, less hazardous and more inexpensive and convenient outpatient sampling methods have replaced the traditional , in - hospital , endometrial curettage .\nthe advantages of outpatient endometrial biopsy include reduced cost and less risk for the patient , as no anesthesia is required .\nfurthermore , the discomfort and pain produced by sampling have been reported to be minimal .\nhowever , it is essential to ensure that outpatient endometrial sampling is quantitatively adequate and comparably accurate to conventional dilatation and curettage .\na sample is judged as adequate if a specific diagnosis can be given from the histological examination of the endometrial fragments obtained .\nadequacy can be measured by comparison of either outpatient biopsy with curettage histological evaluation or outpatient biopsy with the results of pathological examination of hysterectomy specimens [ 3 , 4 ] .\nmany techniques for obtaining an endometrial sample without the need for curettage have been described in the literature .\nchicago , il , usa ) and the novak biopsy curette with a 10  ml syringe functioning as an aspiratory device , which have been shown to be equally effective compared to d&c in detecting an endometrial pathology [ 69 ] .\nhowever , the vabra aspirator and novak biopsy curette , although widely available and relatively inexpensive , have several disadvantages , including the need for an electric vacuum pump to perform the aspiration in the former technique and the pain caused by both methods . as a result of these drawbacks , smaller inexpensive and\nself - contained instruments have been developed and the prototype of this class of endometrial samplers is the pipelle . the pipelle has been shown to have a diagnostic accuracy comparable to that of vabra aspiration and the novak curettage while causing less pain [ 911 ] .\nall of these instruments ( i.e. , the vabra aspirator , the novak biopsy curette , and the pipelle ) have low rates of false - negative and insufficient tissue results for the detection of endometrial abnormalities , as determined by comparison to hysterectomy specimens [ 1113 ] .\nit was found that pipelle biopsy had a sensitivity of 99.2% in pinpointing high grade cancer and a sensitivity of 93% in detecting low grade malignancies ; the sensitivities defined for d&c were 100% and 97% , respectively . while \nexcellent agreement  was generally noted between preoperative histology and grade and the final pathology , pre - operative endometrial sampling more commonly provided underestimates of final grade ( low grade versus high grade ) than overestimates .\nthe explora is somewhat similar in its design to the pipelle , but clinical studies on its effectiveness are scarce , with the effectiveness ranging between 14.6 and 15% according to various studies [ 6 , 15 ] .\nour own findings revealed that the rate of obtaining inadequate samples using the explora was much higher ( 17.6% ) than the rates reported in the literature .\nhowever , most of these cases ( 82.6% ) were obtained from postmenopausal women with atrophic endometrial status .\nthis finding is in keeping with the rates reported by other investigators [ 58 , 16 ] .\nthis retrospective study suggests that traditional d&c produces better endometrial sample adequacy than the explora technique .\nthis finding indicates that clinicians performing endometrial sampling would benefit from more experience and training using the explora technique .\nadditional studies comparing the adequacy of samples obtained with different endometrial sampling techniques and devices are warranted .\nfurthermore , we recommend using the d&c procedure when the explora - obtained samples are inconclusive or when the use of the explora sampler is accompanied by ultrasound findings that are suspicious of endometrial hyperplasia or carcinoma ."}

compare also smith , 1983 ) .\nthe general setting ( subsiding foreland basin , extensive sediment input from the andes , possibly incompletely framed by tectonically active basement highs towards the east ) as well as a wet  dry seasonal climate ( seasonal floods , channel banks stabilized by vegetation ) would provide the conditions for anastomosing river systems ( smith , 1983 ;

invasive project was approved by the research committee of hamadan medical university in january 2009 .\nit was also accepted by hamadan welfare organization , which is the responsible organization of kindergartens in hamadan .\nour methodology is briefly explained as follows . at first , a sub specialist in pediatric infectious diseases provides seven short texts about health and common pediatric infectious diseases prevention .\nthen , a poet transfers these conceptions to childish poems for the first time ( appendix 1&2 ) . in the process of preparing an accurate questionnaire , at first 30 questions with three choices of \n,  false  and  do not know  were made , but 24 items of those are confirmed as valid questions by two experts of health education and infectious diseases . to assess\nthe reliability of the questionnaire a pilot study on a 40 participant sample was performed and cronbach 's alpha of the questionnaire was determined as 83 percent .\nin addition , we defined knowledge mark ( km ) as a parent mark in both the pre - test and/or post - tests . among 35 kindergartens in hamadan , we selected 7 kindergartens by simple random method .\nthe parents ( either father or mother , the one who is responsible to take her / his child ) of all five to six year old children of the selected kindergartens are asked to participate in the survey and a verbal consent is obtained from those who accepted .\nwe excluded the following children from our sample : those whose parents are physicians , nurses , health - care workers , and those children whose parents work at the kindergarten ( exclusion criteria ) .\nwe asked the parents of the sample survey to participate in a pretest by answering to a questionnaire when they are in the kindergartens .\nalso , they were asked to come to the kindergartens personally one more time when it is required ( to answer to the post test ) . then , we asked our kindergarten tutors to teach children seven musical poems about hydatid cyst , antibiotic misuse , botulinum toxin in home - canned foods , dysentery , the importance of sixth tooth , brucellosis and tetanus . in this step , children were not allowed to take home these texts , but they were asked to sing the poems at home and want their parents to re - write the poems on a paper and give them the papers to take to the kindergarten .\nthe teaching stage took between three to four months . during the next stage , parents took a post - test survey with the same 24 questions .\nparents of 115 kids participated in the pre - test and 103 of them completed the post - test .\nstatistical analysis is done on 103 who completed both tests by paired t - test .\nthe sample data consists of 103 parents who provided solutions to both the pre- and post - test question survey . of the participants 77 were female and 26 male . from the level of education point of view\n, 19 were below high school diploma , 45 had high school diploma , 8 had associate degree , 27 had ba , 3 had ma , and 1 had phd .\nthe results of the survey show a significant difference between the correct answers in both pre - test and post - test stages ( fig .\n1 ) . the frequency of correct answers to the tests \n table 1 shows the mean of the correct answers in the pre - test stage is 59.22 while the same figure for the post - test step is 81 ( p < 0.001 ) .\nin addition , we define knowledge mark ( km ) as a parent mark in both the pre - test and/or post - test stages . the mean km shows a significant increase ( 5.01 ) from 13.62 in the pre - test to 18.63 in the post - test ( table 2 ) . \n \nmean percent of correct answers to pre - test and post - test categories \n  analyzed by paired t - test sd : standard deviation mean of knowledge mark in pre - test and post test analysed by paired t - test the difference of km promotion among females and males was not significant ( 21.6120.17 in males and 20.331.61 in females , p=0.8 ) . the km was increased to 19.9325.06 among parents who at most had high school diploma and 23.4720.84 among parents with upper educational levels ( p=0.5 ) .\nhealth has been the concern of poets such as fiona sampson for years , however , these poems never had educational purposes . the results of this study\nconfirm our hypothesis about the role of children in raising family 's knowledge on health .\nthe results show that neither gender nor the grade of knowledge degree ( below and upper high school diploma or below and upper ba ) affect answers .\ntherefore , people with different educational status have received the information similarly implying that this method can be extended to general cases in a straightforward manner . \n\n1 shows that the percentage of correct answers has increased in 23 out of 24 questions .\nthe percent - age of correct answer to post - test has decreased only in one item ( item 11 ) which compares the risk of brucellosis transmission via unpasteurized milk and yogurt . although the term yogurt has not been mentioned directly in the related poem , but there is a hint about boiling mechanism and we expect that the audience discover the answer by logical thinking about the necessitation of boiling milk for preparing yogurt .\nthe decrease in answering is 2 percent which is not significant ; however , it shows that it would be better to mention the conceptions directly in these types of poems in order to avoid any misconceptions .\nmoreover , the percentage of correct answers to the questions of selected topics in pre - test and post - test has been compared ( table 1 ) and shows that parents have done better in post - test about all topics except one .\nthe difference of correct answers to the questions about brucellosis does not show a significant increase in post - test .\nthis finding is probably due to higher basic knowledge about brucellosis among parents . in other words , parents have had acceptable information about brucellosis even without our educational program , so we observe lower contrast between pre - test and post - test about brucellosis\n. it should be taken into consideration that brucellosis is an endemic disease in hamadan and people have been educated in different ways about this disease in recent years . although the lowest contrast between pre - test and post - test correct answers belongs to a question about botulism , the overall assessment shows that parent 's knowledge about this topic has been promoted significantly ( p<0.001 , table 1 ) . the significant difference between the pre - test and post - test km , based on the results of table 2 , is the sign of successful knowledge transfer through childish poems .\nthe researcher 's method is impressively successful ; however , the fact that he mentions that some mothers can not distinguish the semantic difference between information and advice , needs serious attention .\nin addition , since daughters may misunderstand the information , it would be probable to transfer the misconceived information to their mothers and this fact threats the successfulness of study in applying . while , in our study ; firstly , childish poems do not imply sententious , secondly , if the poem is sung wrong , the disturbance in rhythm will be appeared , so the information which is transferred through poems is not at risk of alteration . in evans research ,\nparents get familiar with educated topics with the help of their children in homework assignments designed for asthma management , and are taught about asthma indirectly .\nthe advantage of our study in comparison with evans is that in evans method knowledge transfer brings to bear via homework assignment , while in our study there is no obligation for doing home works , and parents are educated while enjoying their child 's singing . on account of the fact that making communication with younger children is not as difficult as with adolescents for parents , we are sure that knowledge transfers within a family through a continuous and friendly communication will work .\nchristensen expressed the importance of children 's role in promoting the family health status . in his article , he emphasized on the activities that children can perform to enhance their health and promote their family health situation via the health efforts for themselves .\nwe showed that children , additionally to what christensen mentioned , are able to affect their family 's health status directly . they can improve their family 's health as little teachers in health .\nit should be taken into consideration that the limitations of this study was the impact of other media on participant 's knowledge , which was not preventable .\none of the acceptable results of this survey was publishing the poems as a book for children which was republished and welcomed by public .\nthis study 's results suggest that health knowledge transfer to families through childish poems is an applicable method that has many advantages . by applying this joyful , cost - effective and easy - to - use method\nhowever , it should be taken into consideration that this method is applicable for families with trainable children , for teaching in larger scales more general ways should be added to this method .\nmoreover , the simplicity of poems and expressing the topics in a less elaborative form are the key factors that affect the successfulness of this way ."}

investigation diagnosis was atypical shoulder pain and stiffness of non specific etiology in an immunocompromised patient and infection was part of the differential diagnosis not the only diagnosis .\nesenwein et al in his report highlighted the importance of early intervention to prevent chondral damage , osteomyelitis and also to prevent systemic spread .\nvarious authors have highlighted the importance of early diagnosis and management of septic arthritis failing which could lead to osteomyelitis and septic shock . in our patient\n, the diagnosis was delayed due to atypical presentation and over reliance on clinical findings at an outside center .\nwe strongly recommend early imaging studies in immunocompromised patients presenting with shoulder pain and practitioners should avoid loosely diagnosing as shoulder pain with associated stiffness as frozen shoulders .\nklinger et al . did a retrospective study on 21 patients who underwent surgical treatment for septic arthritis of the shoulder joint between 2000 and 2007 , and he concluded that patients with symptoms for less than 2 weeks did well with arthroscopic approach and early infection can be managed arthroscopically .\nour reports show that arthroscopic washout can give good result even after 2 weeks of clinical symptoms if there is no evidence of osteomyelitis .\nseptic arthritis of the shoulder is very often due to hematogenous spread and diagnosis is often clinical .\nlaboratory investigations and imaging studies like mri and usg may be useful in establishing the diagnosis but confirmation is usually by joint aspiration .\npatients who are immunocompromised and have insidious onset of moderate to severe pain and which fails to respond to trial of conservative treatment should be subjected to either ultrasound or mri instead of x - ray because very often in these group of patients it is primarily a soft tissue pathology like impingement , rc tear , calcific tendinitis or rarely infections and malignancies .\nwe recommend that moderate pain of more than 4 weeks duration with severe stiffness in immunocompromised patient ( liver cirrhosis , renal failure , steroid treatment ) should be further evaluated with mri or ultrasound in the setting of normal x -

", "article": "ribonucleotide reductase ( rr ) inhibitors have been studied as radiation sensitizers for over 30  years in both the lab and the clinic .\nthe first of these , hydroxyurea , has been studied in both cervical and head and neck cancers , among others .\nalthough initially promising , many of the clinical trials produced negative results , or those that were difficult to interpret . there has recently been a significant advance in our understanding of this pathway from a number of well - done pre - clinical studies .\nin addition , the discovery of new rr inhibitors with increased potency and improved binding characteristics has produced a significant increase in interest in this area .\nthis review will synthesize the data detailing the response of rr to ionizing radiation ( ir ) and will provide a perspective on the use of rr inhibitors as radiosensitizers in the treatment of human cancers . over the years , many groups have explored the use of rr inhibitors as chemotherapeutics in their own right , or as adjuncts to dna damaging molecules , particularly in hematologic malignancies . while this area looks promising , this subject will not be reviewed here .\nribonucleotide reductase is the rate limiting enzyme in the synthesis and repair of dna and is the only enzyme responsible for the conversion of ribonucleoside diphosphates to deoxyribonucleotide diphosphates , the fundamental building blocks of dna synthesis and repair .\nr1 ( also called rrm1 or m1 ) is the larger , regulatory subunit that is constitutively expressed throughout the cell cycle .\nit binds allosteric modulators , ribonucleoside diphosphates , and the nucleoside analogs gemcitabine and fludarabine .\nthere are currently two known smaller subunits that bind r1 to form the active enzyme ; r2 ( also called rrm2 or m2 ) and a more recently discovered p53 inducible homolog of the r2 subunit , known as p53r2 .\nboth contain a tyrosine free radical stabilized by a non - heme iron complex that is critical in the reduction of ribonucleotides .\nr2 is known to be cell cycle regulated , with the highest levels during s phase , however the precise roles of the r2 and p53r2 subunit in the response to ir are an area of active debate , as outlined below ( figure 1 ) .\ngiven the pivotal role of rr in dna synthesis and repair , many studies have investigated the effect of dna damaging agents , including ir , on rr and its subunits .\neven so , there is currently still a great deal of controversy surrounding the exact mechanism of rr response to ir .\nthe first is that the small subunit r2 is up - regulated and provides dntps for dna repair in addition to its usual role in dna synthesis during s phase .\nthis is supported by a number of studies , including one by kuo et al . , who characterized the response of rr in the human cervical cancer cell line , caski .\nthey demonstrated an increase in r2 protein levels after treating cells with ir , which was correlated with an increase in rr activity .\nhowever , there was no increase in the transcription of r2 , implying that the protein increase was due to post - transcriptional regulation ( kuo and kinsella , 1998 ) .\nthis finding was reinforced by studies that demonstrated dna damage dependent stabilization of the r2 protein without any change in mrna after ir exposure in mouse balb/3t3 cells ( chabes and thelander , 2000 ) ; however it was in contrast to earlier work showing transcriptional activation of the r1 and r2 promoters after exposure to ir in the same cell line ( filatov et al . , 1996 ) . even though the precise mechanism of r2 response to ir damage is unclear , work has shown that human nasopharyngeal cancer cells overexpressing r2 demonstrate a significant increase in radioresistance and fewer dna double strand breaks ( dsb ) after exposure to ir ( kuo et al . , 2003 ) , confirming the concept that r2 is important in the cellular response to ir\nthe second theory involves the p53 inducible subunit , p53r2 , first reported by tanaka et al .\nthey showed that p53r2 was not cell cycle regulated ( unlike r2 ) , but was significantly induced after exposure of normal fibroblasts to ir ( tanaka et al . , 2000 ) and was found to translocate to the nucleus , the proposed site of most important dntp production ( r2 did not ) . in cells that lacked wild - type ( wt ) p53 ,\nthere was no induction , indicating that functional p53 was necessary for p53r2 up - regulation .\ncells transfected with p53r2 were resistant to dna damage induced cell death . in agreement with other studies , they found no increase in r2 mrna , but did not measure protein levels .\nadditional studies have subsequently shown that p53r2 forms an active complex with r1 ( guitett et al . , 2001 ) and\nrr activity increased in correlation with the increase in p53r2 , however the response of r2 was variable , with decrease in some lines and a moderate increase in the others ( yamaguchi et al . , 2001 ) .\nfinally , other models are possible , including one described by xue and colleagues . in their study , both subunits were found to bind p53 in human oropharyngeal carcinoma cells , and in response to ir , were released to bind r1 in the nucleus ( xue et al . , 2003 ) , highlighting a third possibility in contrast to those previously presented .\nclearly , there is still work to be done in elucidating the response of rr to ir .\nmany of the differences seen in the studies discussed can likely be attributed to the use of different techniques , materials , and especially cell lines .\nwhat should be clear is that rr is involved in the cellular response to ir and targeting it is both rational and likely desirable in enhancing the treatment of cancers with ir .\nit is likely that both r2 and p53r2 are involved to a different degree in different cancers , with cellular phenotype likely playing a key role in determining their relative significance .\nhydroxyurea ( hu ) is a hydroxylated analog of urea and was the first rr inhibitor to be extensively studied .\nit has directed activity at the tyrosine radical moiety of r2 and was first found to be active against cancer cells in 1963 ( stearns et al . , 1963 ) .\nsubsequent experiments in vitro showed that in addition to its direct inhibition of dna synthesis , it was also a sensitizer of cell killing by x - rays , particularly if given before or after ir ( sinclair , 1968 ) .\nlater experiments showed that this was also the case in in vivo animal tumor models using isotransplants of spontaneous c3h / he mouse mammary carcinomas ( piver et al . , 1972 ) .\nthe total dose of ir to cure 50% of tumors was reduced when hu was combined with fractionated ir , although this effect was nt seen with single fraction ir treatments . given these encouraging pre - clinical results during the 19601970s ,\nhu was subsequently examined in a number of clinical trials in a variety of human cancers .\nthe majority of these trials have occurred in cervical cancer , most commonly in locally advanced disease . in particular , there were a number of prospective randomized controlled trials in the 1970s and 1980s that examined the effect of hu plus radiotherapy vs. radiotherapy alone .\nand the gynecologic oncology group ( gog ) enrolled 190 women with figo stage iiib or iva cervical carcinoma .\nhu was administered orally at 80  mg / kg starting on the first day of irradiation and every 3  days thereafter for 12  weeks .\npatients received at least 50  gy minimum tumor dose to the whole pelvis followed by a single brachytherapy treatment of 20  gy to point a. in spite of the large number of patients enrolled , only 90 were eligible for assessment of response .\nthis was due to ineligibility ( wrong stage , wrong cell type , etc . ) and those that were inevaluable ( refused treatment , periaortic node irradiation , improper field , etc . ) .\nthe data were impressive , with a complete response ( cr ) of 68.1% in the hu group vs. 48.8% in the placebo ( p  =  <  0.05 ) , and a median progression free survival ( pfs ) of 13.6 vs. 7.6  months ( hreshchyshyn et al . , 1979 ) . however , myelosuppression was more common in the hu group , with seven grade iii or iv myelotoxicities .\nthey recruited 148 women with figo iib or iiib cervical carcinoma and again compared hu to placebo in the setting of conventional radiotherapy , with hu given every 3  days for 12  weeks .\nof the stage iib patients , 74% receiving hu had no evidence of disease at the completion of therapy compared with 43.5% of the placebo ( p  =  <  0.01 ) .\nof the stage iiib patients , the cr rates were 52.5 vs. 33% ( p  =  0.22 ; piver et al . , 1977 ) .\nagain , 78% of patients in the hu group developed leucopenia vs. 11% in the placebo group indicating a significant toxicity in addition to the improved clinical effect . at the time these studies were published\n, it was felt that hu added significant benefit to the treatment of locally advanced cervical carcinoma , and hu plus radiotherapy became the standard of care for the gog .\nhowever , over time , much of the data in these studies has been challenged , particularly in a systematic review by symonds et al .\nthey found a number of methodological problems with the studies such as small sample size , large numbers of exclusions post randomization , subgroup analyses of already small groups and questionable censoring .\nthey concluded that hu  appears to add to acute toxicity and probably increases late complications  and that  there is no convincing evidence of sufficient quality to suggest a therapeutic effect of this drug \nalthough the gog initially used hu as its standard of care in the treatment of locally advanced cervical cancer , it was nt long before this combination was supplanted by a new adjunct to radiation therapy . one of the most important studies prompting this paradigm shift was the gog 120 trial , first reported in 1999 ( rose et al . , 1999 ) and recently updated ( rose et al . , 2007 ) .\ngog 120 was a randomized phase iii study comparing cisplatin alone vs. cisplatin , fluorouracil , and hu vs. hu alone , in conjunction with pelvic irradiation for patients with locally advanced cervical cancer and pathologically negative para - aortic nodes .\nthey reported a significant improvement in pfs and overall survival ( os ) in both cisplatin containing arms ( p  <  0.001 ) , with relative risks for progression of disease or death of 0.57 and 0.51 for cisplatin alone and cisplatin , fluorouracil and hu , respectively , when compared with hu alone . in addition , toxicities were similar in all groups .\nfurther , a similar study by whitney et al . compared the efficacy of standard radiotherapy ( rt ) plus hu with standard rt plus fluorouracil ( 5-fu ) and cisplatin in a randomized controlled trial . in 368 women with figo stage iib , iii , or iva cancer of the uterine cervix , there were significant improvements in pfs and os with the 5-fu and cisplatin combination ( whitney et al . , 1999 ) .\nadverse effects included leucopenia : 4% of 5-fu / cisplatin patients and 24% of hu patients experienced grade iii or iv toxicity .\ngiven the findings of these studies , concurrent cisplatin and radiotherapy became the standard of care in locally advanced cervical cancer , spelling the end of hu use in the treatment of cervical cancer .\nin addition to its study in cervical carcinoma , hu has also been extensively investigated in other cancers , particularly head and neck .\nwhile early studies had significant flaws in methodology , a phase i study showed a 90% response rate in patients treated with hu , 5-fu , and palliative dose fractionated ir ( vokes et al .\n, 1989 ) , prompting a series of trials by the same group and others .\nthis included work by mantz et al . , who examined the benefit of hu when added to a more extensive chemoradiation protocol including cisplatin , 5-fu , leucovorin , and interferon-2b induction chemotherapy followed by 5-fu and hu with fractionated radiotherapy in 32 laryngeal cancer patients .\nmedian follow up was 44.5  months , and , after completion of all therapy , the cr rate was 94% .\nmedian os was 44.5  months , and median pfs was 86 , 78 , and 78% at 1 , 3 , and 5  years , respectively , which compared favorably with other published data and for the first time saw patients with stage iv head and neck cancer failing distantly more often than locally ( mantz et al .\nthe increased local control , unfortunately , was associated with increased toxicity , which has also been seen in other studies .\none phase i study with prolonged infusion of hu with hyperfractionated , accelerated , external radiation in patients with advanced squamous cell cancer of the head and neck showed an increase in the severity of swallowing toxicity compared with previous trials , with severe edema , and reductions in motility and mobility of pharyngeal and laryngeal structures ( beitler et al . , 1998 ) .\nthe same group later published a study examining the long term impact on swallowing that showed persistent , severe swallowing dysfunction ( smith et al . , 2000 ) .\ninterestingly , these studies examined continuous hu infusions based on pre - clinical data that suggested that hu should always be given concurrently with ir to maximize effect . even though local control was excellent , with just 4 of 26 patients experiencing recurrence ,\nquality of life is of great importance in these patients , and the late follow up reported esophageal strictures for the first time after chemoradiotherapy , suggesting that this particular regimen may be too aggressive .\nthe state of hu in head and neck cancer is well reviewed by argiris et al .\n( 2003 ) and while the authors are optimistic about the future of chemoradiation in head and neck cancer , it remains to be seen where hu and other rr inhibitors will fit in the future treatment of this disease site . even as hu has slowly progressed in the clinic\n, work has continued on examining the mechanism by which it sensitizes cells to the effects of ir . in particular , work by kuo et al .\nhas shown that the sequence with which cells are treated with hu plays an important role .\nthey demonstrated that in the caski cervical cancer cell line , clinically relevant concentrations of hu had a significant interaction with ir , with post - ir exposure  >  pre - ir ( kuo et al . , 1997 ) .\nthis was associated with increased g2 delay , suggesting a decrease in the repair of damaged dna .\nin addition , in cells overexpressing the r2 subunit , hu is able to return ir sensitivity to baseline ( kuo et al . , 2003 ) , demonstrating that r2 inhibition is the likely mechanism for hu radiosensitization in these cells .\nthese findings are potentially informative about the failure of hu to become established as a radiosensitizer in cervical cancer . in the majority of the early trials ,\ngiven that hu works best in vitro when dosed immediately after ir exposure , one could conclude that these trials were not optimized for best effect .\nin addition , hu has recently been shown to have a significant effect on the mechanism of dna dsb repair employed by cells after exposure to ir .\nburkhalter et al . showed that cells pre - incubated with hu were unable to use homologous recombination ( hr ) to repair dsb , and instead relied on non - homologous end joining ( nhej ) .\nin addition , cells that were nhej deficient had significantly more dsb after hu treatment ( burkhalter et al . , 2009 ) .\ngiven that nhej is thought to be the dominant dsb repair mechanism in cells treated with hu , rr inhibitors are likely to have enhanced activity in tumors that are nhej deficient .\neven with new studies on its mechanism of action , hu will likely remain consigned to history due to the many inadequacies it has as a drug molecule .\nwhile its oral absorption is almost complete and it is completely distributed in the water compartments of the body , hu has a short half - life ( between 1.6 and 4.45  h ; gwilt and tracewell , 1998 ) and its effectiveness is limited by relatively low affinity for rr and by the development of resistance .\none area where it could potentially find use in the future is in cns neoplasms , as it does cross the blood \nrecent studies have examined its use in progressive meningioma in combination with 3d - conformal radiotherapy and adjuvant chemotherapy . in one trial ,\npfs at 1 and 2  years was 84 and 77% , which is similar to other adjuvant studies ( hahn et al .\nin spite of the mixed clinical data for hu , there is sufficient proof of concept to suggest that a rr inhibitor can be efficacious as a radiosensitizer in human cancers .\nthus , there has been a concerted effort to discover more potent molecules with more favorable pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics for this purpose .\none of the more promising of these is triapine , a thiosemicarbazone that destroys the tyrosyl radical in r2/p53r2 by forming a redox active complex with iron , producing reactive oxygen species . in studies comparing it with hu in vitro\n, triapine was shown to have significantly higher potency in both enzyme and cell assays .\nin addition , it was fully active against hu and gemcitabine resistant cells and was equally potent against r2 and p53r2 , whereas hu was approximately threefold less potent at binding p53r2 ( zhu et al . , 2009 ) .\nin addition , in in vivo models , triapine was active against hu resistant l1210 and kb cell lines and caused significant inhibition of solid tumor growth in mouse xenograft models ( finch et al .\nfurther studies have examined the radiosensitizing properties of triapine in a number of human cell lines .\nused a panel of three human tumor cell lines , including glioma , pancreatic , and prostate cancer cells , with triapine enhancing radiosensitivity when delivered 16  h before or immediately after ir by 1.5- to 2-fold .\nir interaction was associated with a reduction in the repair of dna dsb as evidenced by a persistence of h2ax foci at 24  h ( barker et al . , 2006 ) .\na similar effect was seen in mouse tumor xenografts , again , with greater effect if triapine was dosed just after ir .\nthe most effective temporal relationship between triapine dosing and ir is similar to that seen with hu in earlier pre - clinical studies .\ninterestingly , normal human fibroblasts were only sensitized when triapine was given before , not after ir , suggesting a potential for an improved therapeutic index for ir  triapine sequencing that may be incorporated into future clinical studies .\nare ic50 ( concentration of compounds producing 50% inhibition of recombinant rr activity ) values for both compounds in an in vitro rr activity assay with r2 or p53r2 bound to r1 ( zhu et al . , 2009 ) .\nalso shown are elimination half - lives ( t1/2 ) for both compounds ( gwilt and tracewell , 1998 ; kunos et al . ,\n2010b ) . of note , many cancers have virally or mutationally silenced p53 that allows rr activity to continue unchecked . in these cancers , it is potentially of increased importance to inhibit the r2 and p53r2 subunits that have lost p53 regulatory control .\nthis is the case in cervical cancer , where the vast majority have dysfunctional p53 due to hpv infection . in one study , three cervical cancer cell lines with mutated or dysfunctional p53\nwere irradiated 6  h after triapine exposure . in all cases , the cell lines were sensitized to ir and sustained dna damage as measured by persistence of h2ax foci . in addition , by measuring dctp levels , the investigators were able to show reduced rr activity in cells with and without functional p53 , demonstrating that the inhibition of rr is p53 independent ( kunos et al . , 2009 ) .\nthese findings were reinforced by further work of the same group that also showed a synergistic effect when cisplatin was added in addition to triapine and ir ( kunos et al . , 2010a ) .\nthese promising pre - clinical data have prompted the initiation of a number of clinical trials .\nindeed , triapine has so far been studied in 27 clinical trials in the usa at various stages of recruitment ( www.clinicaltrials.gov ) , including those in both solid and hematologic malignancies .\nin particular there are three trials investigating the radiosensitizing potential of triapine , with data from one phase i study being published by kunos et al .\nthe purpose of their study was to assess the safety / tolerability , pharmacokinetics , and clinical activity of triapine three times weekly in concert with once weekly cisplatin and pelvic radiation in 11 patients with gynecologic malignancies .\ntriapine was dosed in 2  h infusions and the half - life was found to be 2  h. all 10 patients with advanced stage ib to ivb cervical cancer achieved complete clinical response , with a median 18  month follow up showing no disease progression in any of the patients .\nfive of the 10 patients had pet / ct evident pelvic or para - aortic lymphadenopathy before treatment , with complete resolution on follow up imaging after treatment ( kunos et al .\nin addition to the clinical data , the authors also examined objective markers of disease response .\nlate responders had a significantly higher rr activity on day 10 vs. day 1 and there was no temporal change in rr activity in the early responders , indicating that the expected spike in rr activity after ir was suppressed by triapine .\nthe fact that the late responders experienced durable responses in spite of elevated rr activity at day 10 suggests that there may be other mechanisms of triapine activity that require further study .\nthe promising results from this phase i trial prompted a phase ii trial which is now underway .\nover the last 10  years , there have been a number of major leaps forward in the field of radiation oncology that allow us to deliver higher doses of radiation in ever more specific ways to our patients .\nstill , in the vast majority of cases , we are constrained by dose limiting toxicities that must be accounted for when designing treatment plans and balanced against the therapeutic benefit realized .\ntherefore , the field of radio modulation and specifically radiosensitization will continue to grow in importance in the coming years as we search for ways to maximize the therapeutic index of our treatments .\nwhile there are many different radiosensitizers currently being studied , the rr inhibitors are among the oldest of targets , and are getting a new lease of life in recent times with the development of more modern drug molecules .\nas outlined in the review above , the story began with the study of hu in combination with ir in a number of pre - clinical trials in the 1960s , leading to a large amount of interest in the clinic , culminating with the gog adopting hu and ir as its standard of care in locally advanced cervical cancer . while its success in this arena was short\nlived , many parallel studies investigating the mechanism of action of hu were carried out , resulting in a far clearer understanding of the biological interactions between ir and rr inhibitors .\neven as hu was fading from view , investigators were working on successors including the intriguing molecule , triapine .\nas shown above , this drug works in a similar fashion to hu , but has significantly improved potency , pharmacokinetics , and pharmacodynamics .\nthe phase i study in cervical cancers that was recently published includes some very encouraging data , and the field waits in anticipation for the publication of further trials .\nit remains to be seen what the best dosing regimen for triapine will be , however the weight of pre - clinical data , including that with hu , suggests that daily dosing shortly after radiation therapy will be most effective and provide the greatest therapeutic window .\nthese authors would encourage studies incorporating this type of dosing schedule in the clinic , although this must obviously be weighed carefully against the potential for increased toxicity .\nin addition to triapine , there are other new rr inhibitors being tested at various stages , including trimidox and motexafin gadolinium .\n( 1994 ) , in a paper that reported 100-fold more potency at rr than hu in a cell based assay .\nsubsequent in vitro studies have demonstrated that while it acts as a radiosensitizer in panc-1 human pancreatic cancer cells ( ahmed and hassan , 2000 ) , it is less potent than hu and further work is ongoing to fully assess its potential .\nmotexafin gadolinium is a texaphyrin molecule that targets thioredoxin reductase in addition to rr . in in vitro experiments , it was shown to inhibit rr with an ic50 of 26  m ( hashemy et al . , 2006 ) , although given that it has a number of other cellular effects , it is unclear how much of its potency as a radiosensitizer is due to rr inhibition alone .\nit is likely that the coming years will continue to see the emergence of new rr inhibitors with unique properties .\nthe recent advances in the understanding of rr biology and the development of new inhibitors places us at an important crossroads in the story of rr inhibitors .\nthere are sufficient data to provide proof of concept for the target from a biological standpoint , however clinical trials to this point have not been wholly convincing .\nit will be interesting to follow the development of the field in the next 510  years , particularly with the clinical trials of triapine in cervical cancer , and hopefully at least one of the many rr inhibitors being studied will eventually bring additional therapeutic benefit to patients in the near future .\nthe authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest ."}

{"lay_summary": " although the ketogenic diet ( kd ) has been widely accepted as a legitimate and successful therapy for epilepsy and other neurological disorders , its mechanism of action remains an enigma . \n the use of the kd causes major metabolic changes . \n the most significant of them seems to be the situation of chronic ketosis , but there are others as well , for instance , high level of polyunsaturated fatty acids ( pufas ) . \n these  primary  influences lead to  secondary  , in part adaptive , effects , for instance changes in mitochondrial density and gene expression . \n clinically , the influences of the diet are considered as anticonvulsive and neuroprotective , although neuroprotection can also lead to prevention of seizures . \n potential clinical implications of these mechanisms are discussed . ", "article": "the value of the ketogenic diet ( kd ) has been recognized in the treatment of epilepsy , although the exact mechanisms by which it exerts its effect remain an enigma .\nthey seem to be different from those of regular antiepileptic medications ( aeds ) , and discovering what they are may lead to its use in clinical situations other than epilepsy as well .\nthe kd is comprised of four elements , the changes of any of them can potentially lead to losing its anticonvulsant effect : ( 1 ) increased amount of fat , usually in a ratio of 3 to 4 grams of fat for each gram of protein and carbohydrates , ( 2 ) as low a consumption of glucose as possible , ( 3 ) caloric restriction , and ( 4 ) fluid restriction .\nalthough there is some debate about the last component , clinical practice has shown that stopping fluid restriction can lead to seizure recurrence much in the same way as when stopping glucose restriction .  \nthe most important result of observing the diet is the increased blood level of free fatty acids ( ffas ) .\nthe ffas are transferred into the mitochondria , a process which requires the presence of an appropriate amount of carnitine , where they are degraded into ketone bodies through  oxidation .\nthese ketone bodies include  hydroxybutyrate , acetoacetate , and acetone   ( figure 1 ) .  \nthe effect of the increased amount of ketone bodies seems to be the most prominent of all other suggested antiepileptic mechanisms of the kd .\nthe degradation of the ketone bodies delivers acetyl - coa directly to the tricarboxylic acid cycle , thus increasing its turnover while bypassing the need to depend on acetyl - coa coming from glycolysis to produce atp . unlike glucose , which requires a transporter to cross the blood brain barrier ,\nthe ketone bodies penetrate it easily . when this transporter is deficient , as in glut 1 deficiency , the kd is the preferred way of antiepileptic treatment , since it allows for bypassing the need for glucose .\nchildren in whom the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl - coa is blocked , for instance , in pyruvate dehydrogenase ( pdh ) deficiency , will also benefit from bypassing this route .\n hydroxybutyrate is the predominant ketone body measured in the blood , and it is used to monitor the degree of ketosis during therapy .\nthe breath of a patient who is ketotic while on the diet will often even smell of acetone .\nacetone is one of the ketone bodies that have an anticonvulsant effect in several types of mouse seizure models .\nthe mechanism of this effect is unknown , although an effect on k2p channels has been proposed .   by means of the tca cycle ,\nacetyl - coa increases the level of the neurotransmitters glutamate and -aminobutyric acid ( gaba ) and the major excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters in brain , respectively .\nanother product of an elevated level of free fatty acids is polyunsaturated fatty acids ( pufas ) .\nthe potential ability of pufas to block seizure activity in the brain is speculated to be associated with some rather more complicated mechanisms , including ( 1 ) directly inhibiting voltage - gated sodium and calcium channels , ( 2 ) activating a lipid - sensitive potassium channel , ( 3 ) enhancing the activity of the sodium pump to limit neuronal excitability , ( 4 ) activating peroxisome proliferator - activated receptor- ( ppar ) , and ( 5 ) inducing the expression and activity of brain - specific uncoupling proteins in the mitochondria , thereby inducing a neuroprotective effect .\nneuroprotection can contribute to the anticonvulsant effect , but it may have other effects as well , which can lead to other clinical uses of the kd .\nappleton and de vivo   reported that the kd increased the total quantity of bioenergetic substrates ( adenosine triphosphate ( atp ) ) and elevated the energy charge in rat brain .\nacetoacetate , a product of  hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenation , is transferred into acetyl - coa which enters the tricarboxylic acid ( tca ) cycle .\nthe increased turnover of the tca cycle generates protons and electrons that are channeled to the electron transport chain .\nthis , in turn , drives the formation of atp from adenosine phosphate ( adp ) by atp synthase .\nenhanced atp can either be converted to phosphocreatine for energy storage or broken into adenosine .\nenhanced atp levels provide energy reserves for a neuron to continue functioning under stress . increased extracellular adenosine offers a neuroprotective buffer against insults , reduces excitation , and averts excessive atp demands , thus providing local seizure control and neuroprotection .  \nit was also suggested that the kd influences toward an upregulation of transcripts encoding energy metabolism enzymes and increase in the density of mitochondria in neuronal process , leading to heightened energy reserves .\nan improved energetic status can support seizure prevention , for instance , by supporting gabaergic inhibition .\nit is suggested that adaptive processes to the metabolic changes induced by the diet lead to changes in gene expression which in turn result in some of the above - noted changes .\nother path of neuroprotection is modulated through decreased generation of ros which is considered to be related to pufas effect on uncoupling proteins .\nthe fact that the kd is considered a proven therapy with relatively few adverse affects and wide clinical experience , particularly in children , led to recent studies investigating new potential uses for other neurological disorders .\none of the most intriguing and active fields of research is the effect of a high - fat caloric - restricted diet on the survival of brain tumors cells .\nit is hypothesized that mitochondrial abnormalities impair the ability of brain tumors to generate energy from ketone bodies . unlike normal cells ,\nmalignant tumor cells have impaired genetic adaptability due to their genetic abnormalities and , therefore , increased susceptibility to environmental stress , such as fasting or caloric restriction .\nthe same genomic defects that are involved in the creation of brain tumors can be exploited for their destruction [ 3 , 10 , 11 ] .   in 1995 , nebeling et al\n.   reported two young girls with unresectable advanced stage brain tumors who had poor response to radiation and chemotherapy .\nthey were treated with a kd and their response was remarkable , both clinically and according to positron emission tomography follow - up scans .\ndescribed a patient with glioblastoma multiforme whose tumor , which is very malignant , improved on the kd . surprisingly , despite the appealing efficacy of this treatment , no further human studies or clinical trials on the kd as a therapy for brain tumors have been conducted .\nseveral laboratory studies in mouse and rat models have recently confirmed that inhibition of brain tumor growth is directly related with reduced levels of glucose and elevated levels of ketone bodies .\nmoreover , the kd was shown to reduce reactive oxygen species ( ros ) in the brain .\ncancer cells need high levels of ros for the induction of angiogenesis and the production of tumor growth factors , thus , through this mechanism the kd can be protective .\nthe clinical manifestations were mainly intractable seizures that necessitated repeated admissions to the intensive care unit , as well as severe cognitive and alertness decline .\nafter the oncologists decided that antitumor treatment would be ineffective , she was started on the kd .\nafter four weeks of trial , it did not have any effect on the tumor progression .\nhowever , it did have a notable improving effect on cognition , alertness , and mood of the girl , in spite of her devastating condition .\nthe beneficial effect of the kd on cognition , alertness , and mood is well recognized , and clinical experience shows that in many times it is not less important than the anticonvulsant effect .\nthe potential neuroprotective effect of the kd was what motivated investigations into its potential as a treatment option in other neurologic disorders .\nthere are increasing numbers of reports that ketosis achieved by starvation or administration of a kd has a consistent neuroprotective effect after various brain injuries in animal models .\none human pilot study and several animal model studies have shown improvement in autistic behavior parameters with kd treatment .\nit remains to be further clarified whether this improvement is related to reduced epileptic activity found in up to 30% of these patients or to a primary effect of the kd .  \na factor that can be crucial for the application of the kd in medical conditions other than intractable epilepsy is the inherent difficulties in its use .\ndietary restriction can pose a significant problem in a child with a progressive tumor that undergoes massive chemotherapy , who may already be cachectic .\nthe kd may not be an option in a grown - up hyperactive autistic child .\nthus , the neurologist must evaluate the appropriate clinical , familial , and environmental situations very cautiously prior to the recommendation of the kd . in conclusion ,\nthe major metabolic effect of the kd is in supplying the brain with an increased amount of free fatty acids .\ntheir degradation into ketone bodies , together with the load of pufas , leads to major changes in the metabolic , bioenergetic , mitochondrial , and even genetic constellation .\nwhether it may also be effective in other pathologies , especially in treating malignancies , awaits future research ."}

", "article": "embryos generated through assisted reproductive technologies ( art ) are deemed surplus when , for some reason , they are not used for reproductive purposes ( svendsen and koch 2008 ; haimes and taylor 2011 ) ; instead , they are then disposed of or , where this is allowed by a country s art regulation , may be donated for a variety of research purposes .\nthus , the generation and subsequent fate of embryos that are designated surplus are determined as much by legislation as by embryo biology or technological constraints .\nfor example , legislatures differ in whether cryopreservation of embryos is permitted , meaning that in some countries any ivf embryos not immediately transferred for pregnancy are surplus , while in others they may be frozen for later transfer . in some countries , the law considers surplus embryos as the primary source of material for human embryonic stem cell ( hesc ) research , while in others this use of embryos is expressly forbidden .\nalthough hesc research has been subjected to exhaustive ethical scrutiny , the lack of consensus on the ontological or ethical status of surplus embryos means that the uses to which they may then be put remain contested ( deckers 2007 ; guenin 2008 ; moller 2009 ) .\neven if using human embryos for stem cell research is deemed permissible , ethical issues continue to emerge as new social practices and roles develop around the act of embryo donation .\nthe relative novelty of these practices and roles , complicated by the pace of change in technical possibility and regulation , mean that there is still uncertainty about how to conceptualise embryo donation , not just in terms of systematic ethics but as a sociomoral practice in everyday social life and morality ( banks , scully , and shakespeare 2006 ) . from a sociological perspective , and also to understand more generally how everyday morality deals with unprecedented ethical dilemmas , it is important to examine which conceptualisations emerge as salient and how they are stabilised and used .\nfor example , one way of thinking about the donation of embryos to research is as a bodily gift relationship , one of the many established by modern biomedicine such as the donation of eggs and sperm for reproductive purposes , organs or tissues for transplantation , blood for transfusion , and other biological tissues for research .\ndrawing analogies to existing practices in this way has proved helpful in other instances of bioethical novelty ( hofmann , solbakk , and holm 2006 ) .\nhowever , analogies can equally well be misleading , if there are morally relevant but unacknowledged differences between situations .\nthe contexts in which different organs and tissues are donated vary significantly , and these differences influence the sociomoral understanding of donation in each case and make them noncomparable in ethical terms\n. reproductive tissue , for example , is generally distinguished from other types of donated tissue because eggs , sperm , and embryos have the potential to give rise to new individuals , not just to prolong the lives of existing individuals , or to be used for research . because embryos are generally considered to have a different moral status from other tissues , the use of surplus embryos in research raises moral unease about the instrumentalization of human life that is not raised in quite the same way by the donation of either ova or sperm .\nit is therefore unclear whether an embryo can meaningfully be treated as a  gift  (  donation  ) without blurring the morally relevant differences between embryos and other tissues .\nsimilarly ,  hesc research ,  to which the embryo may be given , is a domain of biomedical practices and not an entity . as such\n, hesc research is not a subject with which a gift relationship can be established ( unlike , for instance , an organ recipient ) .\nunderstanding the social and ethical meanings that are emerging for the practices associated with embryo donation calls for a detailed empirical examination of people s reasoning behind donation decisions .\nhowever , most empirical studies of embryo donation have not focused on people s donation rationales in depth ( with some exceptions ; for example , haimes et al . 2008 ; de lacey 2003 ) .\nthe scarcity of data on donor rationales means there is a corresponding lack of information on contextual and other factors that influence donor decisions and how these can be related to the evaluations of theoretical ethics .\nthe authors of this paper have been involved in a series of linked qualitative studies of practices of embryo donation , first in the united kingdom ( researcher haimes and colleagues ) , then switzerland ( scully , rehmann - sutter , and porz ) , and in a smaller pilot project in china ( mitzkat , rehmann - sutter , and haimes ) .\nall three studies shared an interest in understanding reasons for the donation or non - donation of embryos . while the studies in switzerland and china drew upon the original u.k .\ndesign , each study was conducted independently , and the details of each project , including interview design , differed in light of the varying regulatory , clinical , and cultural contexts . however , by looking across the three data sets , we hope to gain cross - cultural insights into donation and non - donation rationales and the moral understandings on which they are based .\nthe three studies all used open - ended , semi - structured , one - off interviews between the researcher and people who had been in the position of deciding whether to donate their surplus embryos to research .\ninterviews were designed to explore in depth not just the interviewees decision about donation but also the background to that decision , such as their ivf story , their family and other relationships , their relationship with the clinic and its staff , and so on .\nthe interviews were transcribed , coded , and initially analysed to identify the reasons for donation decisions given by participants in each study , using an interpretative approach that all of us have previously found useful for identifying key themes around decision - making and implicit or explicit ethical judgements ( charmaz 2006 ; smith , flowers , and larkin 2009 ) .\nstudy ran for more than three years ; after some familiarisation and observation in the collaborating clinic , 44 in - depth interviews were conducted with couples who had been asked to donate their surplus fresh embryos , generated through ongoing ivf treatment , to hesc research ( haimes and taylor 2009 ) . in the united kingdom , it has been possible for some years to donate unused embryos to stem cell and other kinds of research and also to other couples .\nthe swiss study was carried out shortly after a change in the law that permitted fresh or cryopreserved surplus ivf embryos , under strictly defined conditions , to be donated to stem cell research only . in this study , 17 individuals who had variously chosen to donate or not to donate were interviewed ; thus , the decision concerned the fate of cryopreserved embryos some time after the ivf treatment that had produced them ( scully , rehmann - sutter , and porz 2010 ) . the chinese work involved a much smaller three - month pilot study carried out in a large art hospital .\nit was designed as a pilot to provide a comparison with the u.k . and swiss material and is , therefore , included here despite the low number of participants , but with no attempt to draw general conclusions from it .\nlegislation in china does not allow the donation of embryos to other couples , but consent can be given for a surplus embryo to be used in stem cell research or for it to be discarded .\nthe study included participant observation of the information and consent procedures and qualitative interviews with five ivf patients , three choosing to donate to stem cell research and two refusing ( mitzkat , haimes , and rehmann - sutter 2010 ) .\nfor the purposes of this paper , the authors involved in the studies jointly compared the rationales for donation decisions given by their participants .\nwe also independently reexamined interview transcripts for material relevant to the discussion of gratitude . in the rest of this paper , we first identify and compare the main reasons given by participants in these three studies for their decisions to donate or to refuse to donate their surplus embryos to research .\nwe then look in more detail at the implications of our findings for one area of potential ethical concern : the possible role of gratitude in making embryo disposition decisions . in this way\n, we not only collect empirical data to help understand the emerging moral meaning of a new practice , but also give an example to show how empirical data can be used to question and then refine the conceptual basis of bioethical theory .\nparticipants who chose to donate their surplus embryos to research had a background premise that donation is fundamentally permissible because embryos do not have the sort of ontological or moral status that would forbid it .\nthe swiss study discovered people stating this explicitly :  [ embryos ] are not , they are not yet people ; they are nt beings with souls as far as i m concerned ,  as one swiss participant said.1 but this did not mean that the surplus embryos were considered as morally equivalent to any other tissue , and participants in both the swiss and u.k .\ninterviewees stopped themselves midway through sentences referring to the  left over embryos ,  which they clearly felt , on reflection , was an inappropriate phrase .\nso the embryos did not have the sort of moral status that would have made it wrong to donate them , but neither were they completely disposable .\nto some of our participants , embryos had a value ; they were a precious resource ( haimes et al .\n2008 ) that made simply throwing them out an unjustifiable waste . as another u.k .\n[ i]t just really seemed a waste , really , not to have them used .\n it was not always clear , however , quite how interviewees were using this notion of  precious  : whether with reference to economic  bio - value  ( waldby 2000 ; waldby and mitchell 2006 ) or because they had been obtained at intense personal and emotional cost , or because they had high moral value , or possibly a combination of all these aspects\n. particularly in the swiss study , which involved cryopreserved embryos stored for some time , participants referred to embryos moral status in a nuanced way that was highly sensitive to the developmental stage of the embryo , its physical location ( whether inside or outside the body ) , and its state ( whether cryopreserved or not ) ( see scully , rehmann - sutter , and porz 2010 ) .\nstudies seemed less interested in explicitly defining  the  moral status of an abstract embryo than working out what their own particular embryos meant for them at defined points in their own story , and what this meaning then indicated it was morally permissible for them to do with that embryo

surplus embryos they had done something less than ideal . for these swiss participants ,\nthen , their donation decision appears to have been driven in part by what we could call a reparative urge .\nno indication of any similar reparative urge was observed in either the u.k . or the chinese interviews : we discuss this difference further below .\napproximately half of the swiss participants who were interviewed turned out to have decided against donation and instead have their surplus cryopreserved embryo(s ) destroyed .\nnone of these explicitly used the moral status of the embryo as the fundamental basis for rejecting donation to research .\nthe scientists  would do with their embryo , which was articulated either as disapproval of specific types of research ( e.g. ,  not if it s for cloning  ) or as a more general unwillingness to relinquish responsibility of the embryo to unknown others . in both sets of reasoning , therefore , participants were expressing unease about the loss of control over what would happen to their embryo .\nthe two chinese interviewees who had opted against donation also did so because of reservations about lack of knowledge of exactly what the embryos would be used for , explicitly mentioning the fear that they would be donated to ( i.e. , used to generate pregnancy in ) other women .\nin addition , two of the swiss participants gave financial reasons , that is , they expressed anger that they would not be compensated for giving up their embryo and that through donation researchers were  getting something for nothing .\nstudy , speculation about why some people might refuse to donate raised concerns about what might be done with the embryos and whether a baby would be developed through experimentation ; others wondered if  refusers  were worried that another infertile couple would receive their embryos and have a baby when they , the embryo providers , failed to do so .\nsample contained only two actual refusers , who objected on the grounds of possible use in animal research ( haimes and taylor 2009 ; hug 2008 ) .\nthese observations provide material for an empirically grounded bioethics of the ivf  stem cell interface ( franklin 2006 ) . in the rest of this paper , we consider a single aspect in detail : the potential  problem  of gratitude influencing informed consent .\nempirically , the main reasons given by our participants for donation were : ( 1 ) to avoid the waste of a precious resource , ( 2 ) to give something back to research , and ( 3 ) to compensate for a perceived moral wrong . in none of the three countries\ndid our participants indicate that their decision arose out of any sense of gratitude to the physician who had given them ivf treatment .\nthis is an important observation , because the possible impact of gratitude on informed consent in embryo donation has previously been raised by bioethical commentators .\nit has been suggested that if there is any institutional or procedural link between ivf treatment and hesc research , the potential donors gratitude toward the clinicians who have helped them to conceive may steer them toward opting for donation ( haimes and luce 2006 ; parry 2006 ; mcleod and baylis 2007 ; also discussed in roberts and throsby 2008 ) .\nthe bioethical concern is that parents who receive the  gift of a baby  will feel a sense of gratitude ; feeling grateful might then cause parents to feel that they should respond with a gift in return ; and if a request for donation of surplus embryos is made in that context , potential donors might inadvertently be encouraged to see donation as an appropriate form of return gift . in this way\nthe moral emotion of gratitude could compromise the potential donor s freedom to weigh the pros and cons of the request , which in turn means compromising the capacity to give fully voluntary consent .\neven where the clinicians and researchers themselves are scrupulous about not using persuasion , gratitude might be persuading potential donors to do something they would not otherwise choose to do . to avoid this possibility , countries that allow embryo donation for research may attempt a strict separation of ivf treatment and the stem cell research domain .\n( not all legislatures do this , however : china is one country that does not . ) in the united kingdom , for example , it is accepted good practice that requests for donation of spare embryos should not be made by the physician(s ) who delivered the original ivf treatment . in switzerland ,\na predominant interpretation of the current law on embryo donation is that a couple undergoing ivf treatment should not be told even of the theoretical possibility that a surplus embryo might be generated unless it actually is ( porz et al .\nregulators hope to rule out any conflict of interest on the part of the treating physician as well as the possibility of gratitude on the part of the patient .\nthere are several theoretical questions that can be asked about a claim that the  risk  of gratitude affects potential donors decisions .\nfor example , moral psychologists might want to examine the emotional exceptionalism in which gratitude is seen as potentially compromising , while other emotions , or even the absence of emotion , is not .\nthere is also an obvious empirical question which does not seem to have been closely examined : whether potential embryo donors actually do experience a sense of personal gratitude to the physician  or one strong enough to sway their donation decision .\nhowever , they do indicate that participants rationales for donation indicate a desire to  give back  in a more complex way .\nfirst , our empirical results show the importance of distinguishing between the three moral emotions of gratitude , indebtedness , and solidarity .\nwhat we normally mean by gratitude is an emotion primarily associated with gifts or with help that is undeserved .\ngratitude has been defined as  a feeling of thankful appreciation for favours received  ( guralnik 1971 , 327 ) and is experienced as a positive emotion .\n( 2006 ) provide a basis from experimental psychology for distinguishing between indebtedness and gratitude .\none important distinction is that  indebtedness is an emotion of exchange , whereas gratitude is not  ( watkins et al .\neven if a debt of gratitude is felt ,  it does not appear to be analogous to an economic debt \nindebtedness , however , is , literally , a debt : a  state of obligation to repay another  ( mauss 2001 , 2 ) .\na further feature associated with indebtedness but not with gratitude is the inherent imbalance of power , so that a hierarchy is created in which those who are indebted are rendered more vulnerable . the empirical social psychological work of watkins et al .\nindicates that , in experimental settings at least , a person s feelings of gratitude diminish as the expectation of return ( indebtedness ) increases . the more reciprocity is expected or demanded ,\nimportantly for considering the effects of these social emotions on donation decisions , watkins et al . found that the greater the expectation that something will be given back in return , the less motivated the participants were actually to comply with the norm of reciprocity ( watkins et al .\nthese results suggest that if patients were to sense any expectation of return by an individual physician or researcher , it would if anything lessen any gratitude they might have felt . in the ivf context , what people have received ( the thing for which they might feel grateful ) is their baby or pregnancy , or at the very least , treatment . donors who achieve this have not received a gift , but a medical service , which will have been paid for in one way or another . in switzerland , where ivf is not covered by the mandatory health insurance\n, this will often be direct payment from the patients to the clinic , as it will also often be in china . in the united kingdom ,\npatients who do not already have children commonly receive two  free  cycles of nhs treatment ( paid for through taxes on the population ) , and then they pay for future cycles directly through fees to the clinics . whatever the system of payment , however , the point is that the ivf physician or clinic has already been paid , directly or indirectly , for the treatment which produced the outcome .\nso in the case of embryo donation , it could be argued that neither gratitude nor indebtedness should be anticipated .\ngratitude would not be expected , because what patients have received was not a favour or unexpected gift ; and indebtedness would not be expected , because there is no debt if payment has already been made . in our three studies , although we found appreciation and high esteem were expressed for the work of the treating hospital or team , we found no evidence of gratitude being expressed toward an individual physician .\nthis is despite the fact that in both the united kingdom and china mention was made of the well - known head physicians who led each clinic ; the mentions were in appreciation of their reputations , not as a debt of gratitude .\nparticipants wanted to do something with the surplus embryo that would be of benefit to research and medical treatment for infertility , but this was not directly associated with the physician who provided it originally . indeed , some of our interviewees were critical of aspects of their own ivf treatment , while still wanting to support the infertility research enterprise overall . in this context , it should be remembered that about half the swiss participants interviewed in fact chose not to donate , primarily out of anxiety about losing control over the fate of their embryos , but also in some cases because it meant researchers were  getting something for nothing .\nstudy , a few patients were suspicious that research was being prioritised over treatment and that embryos might have been kept back for the research rather than frozen .\nalthough only a small number of participants expressed this view , it has particular relevance here as it indicates clearly the absence of either gratitude or indebtedness : indeed , it suggests that these participants felt that , if anything , donation would mean the researchers were receiving something beyond their entitlement or were indebted to the patients rather than the reverse .\nsocial exchanges may entail giving back not to an individual , because the individual may be unknowable or because the benefit may not have come from a single identifiable person , but to  the pattern of social life \n( becker 1986)for example , giving back to the institutional biomedical research that had helped the participants . in serial reciprocity , person a receives something from person b , but pays back not to person b but to some other third party ( moody 2008 ) . serial reciprocity accounts for the way that altruistic blood donors often do describe their action in terms of reciprocity , even though they have not received anything from the person to whom their blood eventually goes .\nwhat drives serial reciprocity is not gratitude or indebtedness to an individual or an organisation but a sense of solidarity with unknown others in the community . in the case of embryo donation , what appears to be a directly reciprocal act of gratitude  a surplus embryo in return for treatment  may thus be understood as something quite different .\nparticipants in our studies used a rationale for donation based not on reciprocal exchange between individuals , but on  giving back to  a research enterprise from which they had benefited and which they hoped would benefit unknown others in the future . for the swiss and chinese donors who choose to donate because they think they are supporting infertility research , these unknown others are not completely anonymous : they are  known  because of imaginatively shared experience .  giving something back  to the research that had helped them ( as they think they are doing )\nwas not considered an obligation but , rather , a form of return that was meaningful and seemed especially fitting to them because of the experiences they had gone through . in the u.k .\nstudy , although there was greater clarity about the purpose of the research being contributed to , there was still a sense among embryo providers that they were benefiting from the fact that others had participated in research in the past which had improved ivf ; they were clear in expressing solidarity with this imagined community of previous ivf research contributors by making their own contributions to research , albeit research in another domain .\nat least some of our participants , then , also see their donation to research as an indirect way of passing on the benefit they have received from research to someone else , whose situation in some way resembles their own .\nthe social meaning of this indirect reciprocity is neither gratitude nor indebtedness , but solidarity with other present and future patients .\nto summarise : our interpretation of the material suggests that donors reasons for donating were not connected in any straightforward way to either gratitude or indebtedness . for some people\nthe desire not to waste a valuable ( in more than one sense ) resource is foremost .\na generally positive stance toward biomedical science means that donation is a good use of a valuable resource . with some of the swiss participants\n, we also identified a reparative urge coming from a sense of moral unease , and here donation seems to offer a route through which the urge to make reparation can be satisfied .\nall of this suggests that neither gratitude nor indebtedness per se are present in decision - making at the ivf  stem cell interface , at least not in terms of undue inducement or of compromising the capacity for informed consent .\nthe reparative urge foregrounds a different set of ethical questions about the sociomoral meaning of the generation of spare embryos and the act of donation .\nfor example , the perceived need for reparation that appears to drive some of the swiss participants donation choices arises because people felt some sense of wrongdoing at creating embryos that are not used for pregnancy .\nthe spirit of the swiss legal framework strongly reinforces the sense that the occurrence of embryos not used for pregnancy is to be considered as wrong . from this point of view\n, one possible conclusion could be that the felt desire for reparation is in fact an ethically appropriate response : if the act of deliberately creating an embryo is a morally significant one , which needs to be justified by the good of its intended outcome ( pregnancy ) , then not using it for the purpose that justifies it does indeed present a genuine ethical difficulty .\non the other hand , the novelty of surplus embryos in the swiss legal and social context ( scully and rehmann - sutter 2006 ) meant that many patients would have been unaware at the time of their ivf of the possibility of generating a surplus embryo .\nmoreover , in most cases there were perfectly valid clinical or legal reasons why the embryos could not be transferred , which fully justified the failure to use them as originally intended . that these factors were not in the participants control\nthe swiss participants were quite aware of the valid reasons why their embryos could not be transferred , and yet some of them still said that they had fallen short of some moral standard .\nwe suggest that this persistent unease ( which does not appear so prevalent in the u.k .\nthese are captured in swiss legislation s highly defensive attitude toward embryos in general and the generation of surplus embryos in particular .\nswiss law operates from the presumption that a surplus embryo is an exceptional event that will happen only through the failure of regulation and practice specifically set up to prevent it ( porz et al .\nin addition , as we discussed earlier , the generation of surplus embryos is still an unfamiliar social practice and the role of the embryo donor is one that lacks widespread cultural recognition . in the swiss context of legal exceptionalism , then , producing one of these culturally unfamiliar entities may more readily be understood as something \nwrong  for which reparation is in order . in the more permissive cultural and legislative context of the united kingdom , although some interviewees expressed guilt about other aspects of the process ( for example , inappropriate styles of speech about embryos ) , there was no sense that not using the embryos as intended in itself constituted a moral failing .\nif our interpretation is correct , as the creation of surplus embryos becomes normalised in swiss society and the role of embryo donor becomes normalised in both the u.k . and\nswiss ( and other ) societies , there will be a shift in ideas about the moral meaning of surplus embryos , and this should be empirically testable . for the majority of the participants in switzerland and the united kingdom who chose to donate their surplus embryos , donation decisions were not driven by a reparative urge but by the feeling that donation expressed solidarity with research and/or other patients .\nwhat our empirical work shows is that gratitude to an individual must be distinguished from a solidarity - based desire to  give something back  to medical research .\nhowever , this does not necessarily mean that solidarity - based reciprocity has no relevant impact on the capacity for voluntary consent .\none possible consequence , for example , is that if potential donors feel solidarity with the research enterprise , or with present and future patients , then they might also experience an obligation to support it .\nhowever , in all three studies there were people who chose not to donate ( about half of the swiss interviewees did not donate , while in the united kingdom approximately 46 percent of those asked have been shown to opt against donation [ choudhary et al .\n2004 ] ) , which suggests either that there is no sense of obligation , or that it is neither universal nor irresistible .\nthere is a second problem if solidarity - based reciprocity is taken as something to be prevented .\nif there is a risk that gratitude felt by an individual could influence donation decisions , then the risk can be minimised by separating ivf and stem cell research physically and procedurally , as bioethicists have suggested and some clinics and guidelines have implemented .\nbut if instead there is a desire to benefit research or to show solidarity with collective  others  rather than an individual , then what sort of physical or procedural barriers could be set up to prevent it having an influence\n? there are further theoretical questions to be explored here about the assumption that contextual emotions such as gratitude or solidarity compromise the decision to donate .\nthe situation in which donation of a surplus embryo is a possibility comes about as a result of a variety of social , cultural , political , legal , and emotional features that combine to make the situation what it is .\nit will be important to identify carefully the features that are constitutive of the situation of having a surplus embryo ( including a sense of solidarity to similar others , emotional bonds with the embryo that change over time , regret over the failure to use all embryos for pregnancy , and so on ) and to consider whether these constitutive features can or should also be treated as factors that compromise the responsible , autonomous decision - making capacity of the people involved .\nthis introduces the question of the extent to which any decision to donate can be detached from its context and the contextual factors that shape how people respond to donation requests .\nfinally , we should not forget that the possibility that some donors misunderstand the kind of research they are donating to raises some ethical difficulty .\nit means that donors may be deciding for donation out of a misplaced sense of solidarity  a different ethical problem .\nthe deliberative processes of the donor participants in our three studies incorporated their appreciation of the particular moral value of their own embryos and of the value of biomedical research .\nthese deliberations are complex , and the participants own dependency on pre - existing medical research and their affiliation with others in similar situations must be recognised , we suggest , in order to understand how they might configure donation as a means to cope with the moral ambivalence of the situation in which they find themselves .\ntheir decisions are not driven by some unacknowledged sense of debt , but rather are responsive to the emerging social and moral reality of embryo donation in the first decade of the 21st century ."}

kinase which is expressed in the neural crest - derived cell types , including thyroid parafollicular cells , neuronal cells , and adrenal medullary chromaffin cells . in these cell types\n, ret plays a central role in regulating cell proliferation , growth , differentiation , migration and survival . in humans\nafter alternative splicing at the 3 end , ret transcripts encode three protein isoforms with distinct c - terminal ends that contain either 9 ( ret9 ) , 51 ( ret51 ) , or 43 ( ret43 ) amino acids .\nret exon 19 is present in all transcripts and its differential splicing at the 3 end produces distinct transcripts wherein exon 19 is either unspliced , spliced to exon 20 , or spliced to exon 21 .\nall three resulting ret isoforms commonly contain a tyrosine ( tyr1062 ) whose phosphorylation is critical for their activation .\nthe major ret isoforms in vivo are ret9 and ret51 , which consist of 1072 and 1114 amino acids , respectively , and are usually co - expressed .\nret consists of an extracellular ligand binding domain , a trans - membrane domain , and an intracellular kinase domain ( figure 1 ) .\nthe extracellular domain includes four cadherin - like repeats and a highly conserved cysteine - rich region , which is located near the cell membrane .\nthe intracellular domain consists of two tyrosine - kinase subdomains , tk1 and tk2 , which contain multiple tyrosine residues that are phosphorylated during receptor activation and are required for the activation of different downstream signaling pathways of ret [ 19 , 20 ] .\nthe ligands for ret are the glial cell line - derived neurotrophic factor ( gdnf ) family proteins , including gdnf , neurturin , artemin , and perseptin .\nactivation of ret also requires the formation of a heterodimeric complex recruiting a gdnf - family receptor alpha ( gfr ) . when unbound by a ligand , ret is monomeric , unphosphorylated , and inactive .\nwhen a ligand and the gfr co - receptor bind to the extracellular domain of ret , ret undergoes dimerization and autophosphorylation of the tyrosine residues in their kinase domains .\nthis generates the docking sites for their downstream effectors that contain the src homology 2 domain .\nfor example , gdnf - mediated stimulation of ret results in activation of the pathways regulated by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ( pi3k ) and different mitogen - activated protein kinases ( mapks ) , including the extracellular regulated kinases ( erks ) , c - jun amino - terminal protein kinases ( jnks ) , the p38 mapk and the big map kinase ( bmk1 ) erk5 [ 22 , 23 ] .\nret is one of the first receptor tyrosine - kinases ( rtks ) that have been found to play a role in neoplasia , being most well - known as a key etiological factor for thyroid cancer [ 6 , 24 ] . activating mutations of ret\nabnormally enhance ret activity and can trigger tumorigenesis in certain organs although the exact underlying mechanisms are as of yet unclear .\nfirst , mutations of the six cysteine residues ( cys609 , 611 , 618 , 620 , 630 , and 634 ) in the extracellular domains can promote ret dimerization via disulfide bonds and result in constitutive ligand - independent activation of ret .\nsecond , mutations affecting the tyrosine kinase domains can also confer ligand - independent catalytic activity to monomeric ret .\nthese ret mutants exhibit different patterns of autophosphorylation and altered substrate specificity [ 2628 ] . indeed ,\nactivation of different downstream signaling pathways is associated with different clinical features of ret mutant thyroid cancers , as observed in men2 syndromes discussed below .\nfor example , the hirschprung disease , a congenital disorder of neural crest development is caused by a loss - of - function ret mutation .\nof note , the hirschprung disease is closely associated with men2a , demanding a genetic screening for men2a for children with familial hirschsprung 's disease .\na strict correlation exists between specific ret mutations and the onset of hereditary mtc ( table 1 ) [ 31 , 32 ] .\nthe detailed and up - to - date information of ret sequence variations can be obtained from the men2 ret database ( www.arup.utah.edu/database/men2/men2_welcome.php ) , which also contains links to selected men2 literature reviews , gene and protein information , and ret reference sequences .\nthe men2a subtype , accounting for 9095% of the men type 2 cases , is a highly penetrant , autosomal dominant endocrine tumor syndrome characterized by the development of mtc in > 90% of ret mutation carriers . in association with mtc\nin addition , rare variants of men2a are also associated with cutaneous lichen amyloidosis and hirschsprung disease [ 35 , 36 ] .\npatients with men2a usually have mutations in the extracellular cysteine - rich region of the ret tyrosine kinase receptor , usually in exon 10 ( codons 609 , 611 , 618 or 620 ) or exon 11 ( codon 634 ) ( table 1 , figure 1 ) [ 31 , 37 ] .\nmore than 80% of men2a patients exhibit a specific substitution , i.e. , cys634arg , on exon 11 .\nmtc is generally the first manifestation of men2a syndrome and develops during early childhood , usually before age six and sometimes before age two . the men2b subtype accounts for approximately 510% of the men type 2 cases .\nmen2b patients typically feature early coincident onsets of mtc , pheochromocytoma , and gastrointestinal mucosal ganglioneuromas .\nvisible physical symptoms include mucosal neuromas of lips ( bumpy lips ) and tongue , and asthenic marfanoid body habitus [ 36 , 40 ] .\nmen2b patients usually have mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain 2 ( tk2 ) in the intracellular region of ret , which almost always ( > 95% ) lead to a single substitution , i.e. , met918thr , in exon 16 ( figure 1 ) [ 31 , 37 ] . de novo mutations , which usually occur on the paternal allele , are also common in men2b .\nmen2b is characterized by the early development of an aggressive form of mtc in all affected individuals , typically during the first year of life .\nthus , apart from the genetic testing of ret mutations in children born to a parent with men2b , early diagnosis of men2b remains challenging .\nindividuals with men2b are likely to develop metastatic mtc at an early age if they do not undergo prophylactic thyroidectomy before age one . without this intervention ,\nfmtc is considered as the least aggressive clinical variant of men2a with decreased penetrance and/or delayed onset of the other endocrine pathologic manifestations [ 39 , 43 ] . similarly to sporadic cases , familial mtcs are isolated and are not associated with other endocrine tumors .\npatients with fmtc harbor mutations similar to men2a in either the extracellular or intracellular region of the ret tyrosine kinase receptor [ 6 , 44 ] .\nthe onset of fmtc is relatively late , not appearing until the second or the third decade of life , and its penetrance is lower than the mtc caused by men2a and men2b [ 31 , 39 , 45 , 46 ] .\ntherefore , it is often difficult to determine fmtc based upon a family history and only careful genetic screening can distinguish between inherited and sporadic forms of mtc .\nmtc cells secrete the polypeptide hormone , calcitonin , and the glycoprotein carcinoembryonic antigen ( cea ) , and these are used as diagnostic biomarkers for mtc .\nmtc is most commonly diagnosed by immunohistochemical staining of fine - needle aspiration of a new thyroid nodule for calcitonin , chromogranin a , or cea .\nserum calcitonin is the primary biochemical marker used for detection , staging , postoperative management , and prognosis for mtc patients .\nhowever , in very rare cases , certain mtc cells do not secrete calcitonin , which makes diagnosis and patient follow - up difficult .\nsymptoms of mtc include neck pain , a palpable neck mass , and/or diarrhea resulting from hypercalcitoninemia .\nthe clinical course of mtc in men2 patients is variable and is determined by the codon specific mutations . in hereditary form , an age - related progression of malignant disease is observed , with lymph - node and distant metastases being typically detected years after the onset of tumorigenesis .\nmetastatic spread to cervical and regional lymph nodes ( i.e. , parathyroid , paratracheal , jugular chain , and upper mediastinum ) or to distant sites including the liver , lungs , or bone is common and is frequently present in individuals with a palpable thyroid mass or diarrhea .\npositive lymph - node status and higher stage at diagnosis predict lower disease - free survival and higher mortality [ 5 , 5456 ] .\nmen2 is one of few hereditary cancer syndromes for which predictive genetic testing is recommended at childhood .\ngenetic testing for hereditary mtc syndromes has had an enormous impact on reducing the incidence of mtc in the families affected by these hereditary syndromes [ 57 , 58 ] .\ngenetic counseling is indicated for all children diagnosed with mtc and others who either carry or are at risk of inheriting a ret mutation .\nchildren of patients with men2b should undergo ret analysis at birth , and children of patients with men2a or fmtc should undergo ret analysis before age six [ 59 , 60 ] .\neven 610% of apparently sporadic cases of mtc demonstrate de novo germ - line ret mutations , thus making genetic testing worthwhile in all patients with mtc .\nthus , all children with an affected parent in this setting retain a 50% risk of mtc , and surgical decisions must rely solely on clinical testing .\nthe standard treatment for mtc is surgical removal of all thyroid tissue including the posterior capsule [ 39 , 62 ] .\nearly thyroidectomy in all men2 patients can change the course of disease , either in a preventive or a curative fashion .\nthe american thyroid association guidelines task force has classified mutations based upon a model that uses the genotypephenotype correlations to rank the mutations into risk levels for the development of aggressive mtc from the lowest  a  to the highest  d  ( table 1 ) .\nthis classification may be used to predict phenotype , to recommend the timing of prophylactic thyroidectomy and the extent of surgical intervention , and to begin biochemical screening for pheochromocytoma and hyperparathyroidism .\nthe ages at which the prophylactic thyroidectomy is recommended for the children tested positive for the ret gene mutation are as follows : ages 01 for ret mutations that carry the highest risk for aggressive metastatic mtc at young ages , i.e. , classified as  ata - d  ; before age 5 for ret mutations that carry a lower , yet still high risk of aggressive mtc at any age , i.e. , classified as  ata - c  ; after age 5 for ret mutations that carry a lower risk of aggressive mtc , i.e. , classified as  ata - b  or  ata - a ,  so long as the affected children have no other clinical signs of mtc development .\nthere is ongoing debate on what age the thyroidectomy should be recommended for fmtc patients .\nsome clinical institutes suggest the prophylactic surgery at age 1015 , depending upon the exact mutation and family history , while recommending yearly test of calcitonin levels prior to deciding the surgery .\nindeed , the ata management guideline for mtc has been very recently revised . in the setting of a prophylactic thyroidectomy ,\nthe lymph - nodes are not routinely removed since metastases are not expected to occur at this stage . in the case of clinically apparent mtc , whether sporadic or hereditary , thyroidectomy and concomitant central and compartment - oriented lateral neck dissection should be performed to increase clinical outcomes .\nprimary hyperthyroidism is rare during childhood ; therefore , parathyroidectomy is usually avoided , particularly during a prophylactic procedure .\ndissection and autotransplantation of parathyroid tissue is not typically performed at the time of thyroidectomy unless there is enough biochemical evidence for hyperparathyroidism .\nthyroidectomy in children is usually associated with a higher rate of complications , such as recurrent laryngeal nerve injury and hypoparathyroidism , as compared to the surgery in adults .\ntherefore , pediatric thyroidectomy must be performed by highly experienced thyroid surgeons . for individuals with a ret mutation who have not had a thyroidectomy , annual biochemical screening of calcitonin levels is recommended and , if the results are abnormal , immediate thyroidectomy is required .\nannual serum calcitonin screening should begin at age six months for children with men2b and at age 35 for children with men2a or fmtc .\nbiochemical evidence of disease recurrence includes elevation of calcitonin and cea levels . all individuals who have undergone thyroidectomy\nneed thyroid hormone replacement therapy along with annual screening for pheochromocytoma and hyperparathyroidism depending upon the ret mutation present in the patients .\nmtc does not respond well to radiation therapy or the standard cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents , including doxorubicin , dacarbazine , capacitabine , and 5-fluorouracil [ 43 , 71 ] . of note ,\nthe mechanism - based targeted therapies that inhibit ret and other receptor tyrosine kinases have become available for the treatment of surgically inoperable progressive mtc .\nthese include the multi - kinase inhibitors , vandetanib ( zd6474 , caprelsa ) and cabozantinib ( xl-184 , cometriq ) , which have been recently approved by the us food and drug administration [ 72 , 73 ] . a recent phase i / ii trial of vandetanib in children with mtc reported partial responses in 47% patients .\nin general , the drug efficiency and the primary side effects , i.e. , diarrhea , rash , headache , hypertension , and nausea , were similar between children and adults .\nphase iii trial of cabozantinib demonstrated a 28% response rate in adults with significant adverse effects .\ntherefore , there is a critical need for more effective therapies for patients with advanced mtc .\ncharacterization of additional molecular pathways responsible for mtc development may allow the discovery of therapeutic targets that can be exploited to induce reduction of tumor size , disease stabilization , and symptomatic improvement [ 7782 ] .\nmtc and the men type 2 syndromes are rare but significant endocrine diseases that are increasingly encountered by pediatricians .\nour understanding of mtc has been greatly increased by the discovery of ret and the genotype \ngenetic tests according to the established guidelines should be performed whenever diagnosis of mtc is made .\ndue to limited adjuvant treatment options , adequate surgical treatment is critical for initial control of the disease and prophylactic thyroidectomy is recommended for children with men2a and men2b at an early age , sometimes during infancy .\nemerging newer treatments are expected to better treat this rare but life - threatening malignancy ."}

", "article": "neurosurgery is characterized by the delicate balance between surgical success and potential for devastating side effects . thanks to multiple technological improvements\n, the morbidity of neurosurgical interventions has substantially decreased over the last decades , allowing for the resection of previously inoperable lesions . in particular , image - guided neurosurgery ( igns ) devices allow the use of coregistered and fused multimodality 3d images to guide the surgeon 's hand and help define preoperatively the boundaries of pathological and predefined functional structures . meanwhile\n, new modes of medical imaging have also improved the localization of pathological lesions and their characterization .\nmedical imaging nowadays includes a wealth of different techniques , such as computed tomography ( ct ) , structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging ( smri and fmri ) , diffusion tensor imaging ( dti ) , and positron emission tomography ( pet ) .\nalthough the overall accuracy of igns is estimated to be 12  mm , current neuronavigation systems can not , however , adapt to changing conditions over time .\nskull - opening brain shift , brain retraction , cerebrospinal fluid suction , lesion resection , perfusion , and pharmacological manipulation during surgery indeed all alter the 3d morphology of the structures [ 25 ] .\nthese changes can lead to localization errors that are one order of magnitude larger that igns accuracy [ 1 , 2 , 6 ] and may result in incomplete resections or unexpected damage to normal brain .\nsuch inaccuracies could be reduced if one could acquire , throughout surgery , fresh images of the same modalities and quality as the preoperative ones\nintraoperative images such as intraoperative mr ( imr ) images are  with the exception of a handful surgical facilities  usually acquired using low - field mri scanners that provide lower resolution and contrast than their preoperative counterparts , and , to this date , several useful imaging modalities , such as pet and possibly meg , can not be acquired intraoperatively .\none solution is to  bring over  the high - quality preoperative multimodality images into the intraoperative configuration of the brain using a nonrigid registration technique [ 710 ] .\none category of nonrigid registration techniques uses physics - based models , where landmarks are tracked in successive reduced - quality intraoperative images , and their displacement fields drive the deformation of a biomechanical model .\nso far , most of the mechanical conditions of the brain can not be estimated in the operating room , such as the volume of cerebrospinal fluid flowing out of the skull cavity , intercellular fluid volume changes that result from mannitol injection , or changes in blood volume and vessel permeability .\nthe fact that an intraoperative image can provide the knowledge of the current state of the brain after some deformation partly eliminates the need for a complete evaluation of these mechanical conditions .\nthe nonrigid registration technique replaces them with the landmark displacements evaluated from successive intraoperative images . using a nonrigid registration technique based on a biomechanical model , three types of brain deformations\nhave been identified that require specific modeling , although they depend on common parameters , such as csf suction , perfusion , or pharmacological manipulation .\nthe first deformation is the brain shift , which appears at the beginning of surgery with the opening of the skull and dura .\nthe suction or leakage of csf , as well as the release of intracranial pressure caused by tumor growth , generally cause such shift of the brain ( note that in this work , we name  brain shift  the specific shift of the brain that occurs after the opening of the skull and dura , before any other surgical act has happened ) .\nhowever , for these deformations , we will consider that the shift is a part of these two deformations .\nthe second deformation is the retraction ; when target tissues are located deep inside the brain , the surgeon incises brain tissues and inserts a retractor to spread out the tissues , and to create a path towards the target .\nthe third deformation is the resection , that is , the removal , of lesion tissues .\nthree deformations can thus be defined in terms of the two elemental actions that change the topology of the brain : the introduction of a discontinuity and the removal of some tissues .\nmost studies of brain deformation based on biomechanical models have focused on shifts ( the topology of the brain is not modified ) , that occurs just after the opening of the skull and dura [ 1125 ] .\na good review of these different studies can be found in [ 24 , 2628 ] .\nresection and retraction are more complex to model than ( brain ) shift . until recently ,\ntheir modeling for the specific application of preoperative image update has received much less attention .\none of the difficulty for modeling resection and retraction is that both induce a topological change of the brain because some tissue are cut .\na method of mesh adaptation [ 2931 ] or remeshing [ 3235 ] must be used in conjunction with fem if an accurate representation of the location of the cut , for example , the resection cavity or retraction path , is needed to deform the model . indeed , fem can not directly handle discontinuities that go through the fes , and requires to realign the discontinuity with fe boundaries . in the field of fracture mechanics , which studies the growth and propagation of cracks in mechanical parts\n, some methods were developed to avoid using fem in conjunction with mesh adaptation or remeshing .\nthe extended finite element method ( xfem or x - fem ) appeared in 1999   and has been the object of considerable research since then .\nxfem works by allowing the displacement field to be discontinuous within some fes of the mesh .\nthe mesh does not have to conform to the discontinuities , so that these can be arbitrarily located with respect to the underlying fe mesh . because xfem allows an accurate representation of the discontinuities\nwhile avoiding mesh adaption or remeshing , and because of the similarity between cracks in mechanical parts and cuts in tissue , we proposed the use of xfem for handling cut , resection , and retraction in the updating of preoperative images .\nthis paper presents a complete 3d framework for updating multimodal preoperative images with respect to surgical brain deformations , due to brain shift and successive resections , followed and quantified using imr images .\nour approach is modular , and is applied iteratively each time a new intraoperative image is acquired .\nwe take into account successive deformations based on a linear elastic biomechanical model which is deformed using fem or xfem , depending on the type of deformation occurring between the pair of imr images under consideration , namely , brain shift or resection .\nwhile some 3d results have already been presented for brain shift , and initial 3d results for resection   modelings , this paper is the first complete and detailed account of the generalization to 3d of our 2d previous work .\nwe present the state - of - the - art of resection modeling for preoperative image update . in section 3\n, we describe our basic strategy for updating preoperative images based on successive intraoperative images . in section 4 , we give detail about our methods and algorithms . in section 5 ,\nwe consider two patient cases that illustrate our approach for handling brain shift followed by successive resections .\namong studies that take into account resection for preoperative image update , one should distinguish two categories .\nthe first category of studies models brain deformation using two time - point images , the first image being acquired before surgery has started , the second image being acquired after resection . in this category ,\nthe methods that existed for a second image showing some brain shift are adapted for a second image showing some resection .\nthe second category of studies models brain deformation using more than two time - point images , and models at least two successive resections . among the first category of studies ,\nhagemann et al .   developed a 2d method for modeling brain deformation between a preoperative mr image and a postoperative mr image , the postoperative image showing a complete resection .\nthe 2d mesh of the biomechanical model corresponded to the underlying pixel grid of the 2d image .\nthe biomechanical model included four different linear elastic laws for the skull / skin region , the whole - brain region , the csf region , and the image background .\nthey computed the correspondence of the skull boundary , the whole - brain region boundary in the neighborhood of the tumor , and the posterior midline between the two images .\nthey also computed the correspondence between the internal tumor region boundary visible in the preoperative image , and the resection cavity boundary visible in the postoperative image , both boundaries corresponding under the assumption that the resection is complete .\nthe displacements fields of these landmarks drove the deformation of the biomechanical model . as a result , the biomechanical model presented high deformation in the tumor region , which is not physically plausible .\nhowever , the resection was complete , and , thus , they were not interested by the displacement field of the biomechanical model in the tumor region itself .\nclatz et al .   developed a 3d method for modeling the brain deformation between a preoperative mr image and an imr image , the latter showing partial or complete resection .\nthe biomechanical model was deformed based on a sparse volume displacement field evaluated from the two images , using a block matching algorithm . in their algorithm , blocks of voxels that presented discriminant structures were selected in the preoperative image .\nthe blocks were then matched to blocks in the imr image using a similarity criterion , for example , a coefficient of correlation .\nthe value of the similarity criterion was used as a value of confidence in the displacement measured by the block matching algorithm .\nthe biomechanical model was then deformed iteratively , driven by the sparse displacement field of the matched blocks , where a block rejection step was included for measured block displacements initially selected but considered as outliers . in the imr image , a part , or the totality , of the tumor tissues\nthe blocks were thus selected and matched in only the healthy - brain region of the two images .\nthey tested their algorithm on six patient cases , and used for validation nine landmarks picked up manually in each image .\nthey found a mean and maximum error on displacements of 0.75  mm and 2.5  mm , respectively .\nthey explained this phenomenon by the fact that a substantial number of block matchings were rejected in the tumor neighborhood .\nthe deformation of the biomechanical model in the tumor neighborhood was thus essentially governed by the linear elastic law , and the result might show the limitation of this model .\narchip et al .   also tested the nonrigid registration method presented in   on eleven patient cases , and used the 95% hausdorff distance   for evaluating the alignment of the nonrigidly registered images . as a result\n, they obtained a mean error of 1.82  mm . among the second category of studies , miga et al .  \nthey built a linear poroelastic biomechanical model and preoperatively tagged the tetrahedron fes that were going to be removed to simulate the brain deformation due to successive resections .\nsecond , a boundary condition was applied to the new boundary of the resection cavity , in order to model the relaxation of strain energy , induced by preoperative tumor growth or surgery acts , stored in the resected tissues , and released after their removal . in this approach ,\nthe tissue discontinuity was represented as best as possible with a jagged topology defined by the fe facets defining the boundary of the resection cavity .\n[ 45 , 46 ] also modeled the removal of tetrahedra in order to model the action of an ultrasonic aspirator in the context of real - time surgery simulation .\n[ 13 , 47 , 48 ] modeled successive resections based on several time - point imr images . between two successive images\n, they deformed the biomechanical model , in its current state of update , to take into account the ( partial ) resections(s ) that took place between these two images .\nfirst , the biomechanical model , in its current state of update , was deformed in accordance with the displacement field of the healthy - brain boundary between the pair of images under consideration .\nsecond , the fes that fell into the resection cavity in the second image of the pair were removed , while the fes that laid across the resection - cavity boundary were cut . to ensure the link between the successive deformed configuration of the biomechanical model , their algorithm kept track of the topology modification between fes and nodes of the mesh before and after the removal of fes .\nthey tested their algorithm on one patient case including five imr images ( the first two imr images being used for brain shift modeling ) , and used for validation thirty - two landmarks picked up manually in each image .\nthey found a mean and maximum error on the displacements of 0.9  0.7  mm ( mean  standard deviation ) and 3.7  mm , respectively .\nthey explained this phenomenon by the limited accuracy in the process of picking landmarks in that region , and because the retraction occurring between the second and third images was modeled as a resection , that is , a removal of tissues , even though the tissues were not removed but simply spread out .\nthe methods described above have been all developed using an fem - based biomechanical model for intraoperative image registration .\nthe objective of a surgical simulator is to provide an interactive manipulation with force feedback of the anatomical part to be operated using various surgical instruments . in order to model a large range surgical procedures ,\njebkov and kuhlen   have applied nonlinear xfem for simulating cut , and have shown that xfem is successfully efficient for such purpose .\nthe block diagram of figure 1 shows our global approach for updating preoperative images using successive imr images acquired at different critical points during surgery .\nalthough the principles of the approach are quite general , they are tailored for use based on images acquired with a 0.5  tesla intraoperative ge signa scanner , which guarantees that the full volume of brain tissues is included in the image field of view . in our present strategy ,\nthe preoperative images are updated incrementally . at the end of each update , the preoperative images should be in the best possible alignment with the last imr image acquired .\nprior to surgery , a patient - specific biomechanical model is built from the set of preoperative images . because the patient does not necessarily lie in the same position during the acquisition of each of the preoperative images\n, one may need to perform a rigid registration ( involving translations , rotations , and scales ) to bring these images into correspondence , assuming , in first approximation , there is no local , that is , nonuniform , brain deformation between preoperative images .\nonce the 1st imr image has been acquired prior to the opening of the skull , the set of registered preoperative images and the biomechanical model are registered to the 1st imr image via a rigid transformation . in the present situation , it is assumed that the patient 's brain imaged in the 1st imr image has the same physical shape as the brain imaged in the preoperative images ( note that in the following , when an imr image is defined by a number , this number is the index of the imr image in the series for a specific patient case .\nthe 1st imr image thus corresponds to the very first imr image of the series ) . as each imr image\nis acquired , this new image and the preceding imr image are used to estimate the deformation of the brain .\nthe update of the preoperative images is done incrementally with each new pair of successive imr images . for each pair , we proceed as follows . a set of common anatomical landmarks\nthe use of surface structures rather than volume structures   seems more appropriate given the reduced - quality of typical intraoperative images , and would be more easily adapted to intraoperative modalities other than imr , such as ius .\nthe landmark surface displacement fields resulting from the matching are then applied to the biomechanical model , which is deformed using fem or xfem , depending on the type of deformation occurring between the acquisition times of the imr images in the pair under consideration , namely , brain shift , or resection .\nthe resulting displacement field of the biomechanical model is finally used to warp the set of preoperative images in their current state of updating .\nnote that , for each deformation modeling , the biomechanical model is deformed in accordance with the landmark displacements tracked between the pair of successive imr images under consideration . because intraoperative deformation can follow a reverse direction , it is important to track the landmarks between the next - to - last and the last acquired imr images , rather than track the landmarks between the first and the last acquired imr images . for the patient cases treated in section 5 , we assume that the brain undergoes relatively small deformations ( small strains and small displacements ) , and we use a linear finite - element formulation in the biomechanical model .\na consequence of using this linear formulation ( linear elasticity ) is that the equations of solid mechanics can be solved based on the initial configuration of the solid .\nactually , knowing the displacement field increment un = u  u at the anatomical landmarks between configuration n and increment n + 1 , one can apply this constrained displacement field increment un to the initial configuration , and the finite element analysis will lead to the deformation tensor increment n between the configuration n and n + 1 .\nthe final deformation tensor or the body is thus simply obtained from  = k=0k .\nremark that rigorously , the increment of constrained displacement field at the landmark should be applied to the balanced solution of the solid reached after increment n , but as we are using a linear elasticity model , this step can be skipped owing to the superposition principle : if  = c , then  = k=0k = ck=0k = c , where c is the hooke tensor . as a summary , with this approach ,\nthe process of deformations is modeled as a succession of deformations k , for example , brain deformation composed of shift followed by successive resections and the current configuration of the brain biomechanical model , after a specific deformation can then be recovered by adding the computed volume displacements for all successive incremental deformations . remark\nthat this is not a limitation of the method as we could easily extend it to nonlinear model by simply keeping in memory the previous deformed configuration n and adding the constrained displacement field increment un to compute the new deformed configuration at increment n + 1 , simply this would be less computationally efficient . because we use a linear formulation ( and , thus , the incremental volume displacement fields can be added to recover the current configuration of the biomechanical model ) , we could theoretically obtain an identical deformed configuration of the biomechanical model using the two following approaches .\nthe first one would consist of computing and adding the successive incremental deformations of the biomechanical model based on the landmarks tracked between the next - to - last and the last acquired imr images .\nthe second approach would consist in computing directly the deformed configuration of the biomechanical model based on the landmarks tracked between the first and the last acquired imr images .\nhowever , the landmarks selected to drive the deformation of the biomechanical model vary depending on the type of deformation , namely , brain shift or resection .\nin addition , part of the biomechanical model is  cut ,  using xfem , to model resection .\nconsequently , we would not get an identical deformed configuration of the biomechanical model by these two approaches .\nin order to use a maximum of information from the imr images , we track , as explained for the first approach , the landmarks between the next - to - last and the last acquired imr images .\nthe problem of updating preoperative images between more than two critical points during surgery , that is , based on more than two imr images , is addressed in only a small number of studies . in our previous work [ 39 , 41 ] , and in\n, the biomechanical model was successively deformed , and this was done using a linear formulation .\nthe framework proposed here , where the initial biomechanical model is always used , instead of using it in its successive states of deformation , has the important advantage of using a good quality mesh for each deformation modeling rather than using a mesh whose quality progressively deteriorates with each successive deformation modeling , and which would require remeshing or mesh adaptation for getting back good fe quality . to summarize ,\nfor each deformation , the landmarks are tracked between the two successive imr images under consideration . because we use a linear formulation ,\nthe displacement fields of these landmarks are applied to the initial , rather than current , configuration of the biomechanical model .\nthe resulting volume displacement field corresponds to the deformation that the brain undergoes between the two imr images .\nthis volume displacement field is used to deform the preoperative images in their current state of update , that is , registered ( at the previous step , if any ) to the first imr image of the pair .\nafter the deformation , the preoperative images are thus in as good as possible registration to the second imr image of the pair . in all the rest of this work ,\nwe make a simplification of the approach just presented , by using the 1st imr image as a substitute for the preoperative images .\nthe biomechanical model is thus built based on structures visible in the 1st imr image , instead of in the preoperative images , and the structures used in the model are limited to the ones visible in the intraoperative image . except for the rigid registration between the preoperative images , the biomechanical model , and the 1st imr image , this simplified approach allows us to discuss , illustrate , and test all key aspects of the system .\nthe above strategy allows us to focus on the main issue of this paper , that is , the estimation and handling of 3d deformations .\neven though the issues involved in the update of preoperative images will need to be addressed in a operational image update system , the present strategy of deforming the imr images remains useful for calibration purpose , even in the operating room .\nthis section details the different methods that are commonly used for updating preoperative images in presence of brain shift and resection .\nmore specifically , the block diagram of figure 2(a ) shows the building of the biomechanical model from the preoperative images .\nspecific regions from the preoperative images are segmented , meshed , and assigned appropriate constitutive laws .\nthe block diagram of figure 2(b ) shows , for any pair of successive imr images , a detailed view of the calculation of the volume displacement field of the initial biomechanical model that corresponds to the deformation that has occurred between the acquisition time of these images . all along surgery , the patient is lying inside the 0.5 tesla intraoperative ge signa scanner .\nalthough the patient 's head is fixed , one can not totally rule out the possibility of slight head motion .\nimr images thus have to be rigidly coregistered to take into account this potential rigid motion .\nthe rigid registration that we use is the point - based landmark transform available in vtk ( http://www.vtk.org/ ) .\nthe segmentation of imr images into specific regions , for example , healthy - brain and tumor regions , is first performed manually using 3d slicer ( http://www.slicer.org/ ) and then smoothed to minimize the dependance of the results on segmentation roughness .\nit is clear that performing a manual segmentation in the operating room is not acceptable , and that this process needs to be automated as completely as possible to test the feasibility of our framework online .\nhowever , while there exist sophisticated segmentation algorithms that could be used [ 5052 ] , in particular for extracting the whole - brain region ( skull and external cerebrospinal fluid masked out ) , the segmentation of the tumor region is still challenging . as mentioned above , the biomechanical model is built , in the present context , from the 1st imr image rather than from the preoperative images . thanks to the use of xfem instead of fem for modeling discontinuities , this biomechanical model can be built offline before the operation starts and does not need to be repeated ( through remeshing ) during the surgery . with respect to fem - based approaches ,\nthe execution time thus ceases to be a limiting parameter , which is a remarkable advantage of our approach .\nit thus requires specific techniques , and we use the meshing software tool isosurf ( http://svr-www.eng.cam.ac.uk/~gmt11/software/isosurf/isosurf.html ) . our goal is to model the boundaries of healthy - brain and tumor regions as two connected surfaces meshes .\nhowever , isosurf can only mesh the boundaries of one or several separate regions , and , thus , does not allow one to mesh connected region boundaries with common nodes at their intersections .\nwe thus start by building two separate surfaces meshes that we connect using our own routines based on vtk .\nthe two connected triangle surfaces are then jointly meshed into a single volume mesh of tetrahedra that conform to the two surface meshes using gmsh ( http://www.geuz.org/gmsh/ ) .\nfurther details on the building of the biomechanical model , in particular the building of the connected surface meshes , can be found in .\na linear elastic law is assigned to the biomechanical model , with young modulus e = 3000  pa and poisson ratio  = 0.45 . because displacements , rather than forces , are applied to the model using a linear formulation , the fem or xfem solution is independent of young modulus e .\nwe choose as surface landmarks the whole - brain and internal tumor region boundaries . to evaluate the surface deformations of these region boundaries between two imr images , we use an active surface algorithm [ 55 , 56 ] .\nbecause these region boundaries to match must be closed surfaces , we thus use as surface landmarks the whole - brain and healthy - brain region boundaries .\nthe surface deformation of the internal tumor region boundary will be derived from the active surface algorithm of the healthy - brain region boundary . in our active surface algorithm coming from [ 13 , 47 , 48 ] , the external forces f(x ) are computed using a gradient descent on a distance map of the region boundary . with such external forces , the active surface algorithm is not able to take correctly into account local rigid motion due , as an example , to lateral or tangential movement depending on the head orientation . for the whole - brain region , any rigid transformation that could have occurred\nhas already been taken into account by the rigid registration of the imr images ( section 4.1 ) . however , for the healthy - brain region , it can happen that the internal tumor region boundary moves partly in a rigid way .\ntherefore , the active surface , initialized from the healthy - brain region boundary in the first imr image , is first locally transformed in a rigid way along the internal tumor region boundary using the iterative closest point transform available in vtk .\nthen , this resulting surface is deformed using the active surface algorithm as explained above .\nfurther details on the local rigid registration of the healthy - brain region boundary can be found in . before applying the displacements whole - brain and internal tumor region boundaries to the biomechanical model nodes ,\nthe two surface displacement fields are smoothed based on a weighted - distance average , that is , the displacement of each node is averaged with the displacements of its n closest neighbor nodes .\nthis smoothing will make them consistent with each other , and compatible with the volume mesh in order to avoid element flipping , in particular at the intersections between whole - brain and internal tumor region boundaries .\nthe displacement fields of the surface landmarks are applied to the biomechanical model , which deforms according to the laws of solid mechanics .\nthe equations of solid mechanics are solved using fem or xfem , depending upon the type of circumstances , namely , brain shift or resection .\nwe use the fem - software tool metafor ( http://metafor.ltas.ulg.ac.be/ )   developed in our mechanical - engineering department , to which we have added an xfem module .\nthe initial stress state of the brain is unknown and is thus set to zero for each fem or xfem computation , as in [ 10 , 13 ] .\nfem discretizes the solid of interest into a mesh , that is , into a set of fes interconnected by nodes , and approximates the displacement field u(x ) by the fem displacement field u(x ) defined as \n ( 1)ufem(x)=iii(x)ui , \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t where i is the set of nodes , the i(x ) 's are the nodal shape functions ( nsfs ) , and the ui 's are the nodal degrees of freedom ( dofs ) .\neach i(x ) is defined as being continuous on its compact support i , which corresponds to the union of the domains of the fes connected to node i . in our approach , we use linear nsfs .\nin contrast , xfem handles a discontinuity by allowing the displacement field to be discontinuous within fes [ 37 , 5860 ] .\nthe xfem displacement field generalises the fem displacement field ( 1 ) with \n ( 2)uxfem(x)=iii(x)ui+iji(x)j=1neigj(x)aji . \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nthe first term corresponds to the fem displacement field ( 1 ) , where i is the set of nodes , the i(x ) 's are the fem nsfs , and the ui 's are the nodal fem dofs . the heart of xfem is the  enrichment  that adds a number , n , of dofs aji to each node i of the set j , which is the subset of nodes of i whose support is intersected by the discontinuity of interest .\nthese dofs are multiplied by the nsfs i(x ) and the discontinuous functions gj(x ) .\nthe use of specific xfem enrichment functions gj(x ) for a node i  j depends on the type of discontinuity , for example , crack , hole , material interface , and so forth , to be modeled .\nsuppose that our goal is to model a crack , characterized by a discontinuity in the displacement field ( as opposed to a material interface for instance , characterized by a discontinuity in the derivative of the displacement field ) .\nwhen the crack fully intersects the support of the node , a simple choice is a piecewise - constant unit function that changes sign at the boundary across the crack , that is , the heaviside function \n ( 3)h(x)={1for  ( xx)en>0,1for  ( xx)en<0 , \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t where x is again the position of a point of the solid , x * is the position of the point on the crack that is the closest to x , and en is the outward normal to the crack at x * . in case of resection deformation , the goal is to model a discontinuity such that the part of tissues corresponding to tissue removed by the resection has no influence on the deformation of the remaining part of the tissues .\none is actually interested in the deformation of the remaining part of the tissues only . in that sense ,\nthe hole function    as the following equation :  \n ( 4)v(x)={1for  ( xx)en>0,0for  ( xx)en<0 , \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t could be used as xfem enrichment function , instead of the heaviside function , and would be totally sufficient .\nthe results that we would obtain on the remaining part of the tissues would be identical .\nhowever , because the heaviside function is necessary for retraction modeling , we have used the same function for the resection modeling even if it was not strictly necessary . when minimizing the total deformation energy , the resulting xfem equations remain sparse and symmetric as for fem .\nwhereas fem requires a remeshing and the duplication of the nodes along the crack to take into account any discontinuity , xfem requires the identification of the nodes whose support is intersected by the crack and the addition of dofs : ( 1 ) any node whose support is not intersected by the discontinuity remains unaffected and thus possesses three dofs ; ( 2 ) any node whose support is fully intersected by the discontinuity is enriched with three heaviside dofs and thus possesses six dofs . to qualitatively estimate the similarity between two images , we compare the edges extracted from these images using the canny edge detector available in itk ( http://www.itk.org/ ) .  \nindeed , although potentially useful for the sake of comparing methods on a mathematical basis and defining unique correspondences , landmark - based target analysis presents several relevant limitations in the present setting . having experts picking landmarks introduces significant intra- and interobserver variability . picking landmark points , as ferrant et al .  \ndid , is rather difficult when it comes to define enough visible landmarks  especially in the tumor region  on the 5 different images ( and not 2 images only , as majority of studies focusing on brain shift are using ) . rather than point targets , linear tumor contours , and limits between structures and potential eloquent structures matter most in the practical case of tumor ablation neurosurgery . \n\t\t\t\t\t\nthese are the reason why we chose to use the canny edges in order to evaluate the registration . besides\n, while it is true that these edges do not necessarily physically correspond between the successive imr images , these images have been acquired with the same image protocol ( mr sequence , voxel size , grayscale value range ) , which should limit this problem .\nto quantitatively estimate the similarity of the two edge maps , we compute the modified hausdorff distance between the sets of edge points , that is , voxels representing the edges , in these two images .\nthe modified hausdorff distance (a , b )   between two sets of points a and b is defined as \n ( 5)(a , b)=max(h(a , b),h(b , a ) )  with  h(a , b)=1naaad(a , b ) , \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t where the directed hausdorff distance h(a , b ) is a measure of the distance of the point set a to the point set b , na is the number of points in set a , and d(a , b ) is the distance of point a  a to the closest point in b , that is , d(a , b ) = minbb||a  b|| , where ||a  b|| is the euclidean distance .\nthe directed hausdorff distance h(a , b ) thus computes the average distance of points of a to points of b. the averaging minimizes the effects of outlier points , for example , due to image noise .\nthe value of the modified hausdorff distance (a , b ) increases with the amount of difference between the two sets of edges points . in the following ,\nwe denote by (ia , ib ) the modified hausdorff distance of the edges extracted from the whole - brain region of the images ia and ib , that is , with the skull and external cerebrospinal fluid masked out from them .\nin this section , we apply our methods , respectively , of brain shift and resection ( imr images are acquired with the 0.5  tesla intraoperative ge signa scanner of the brigham and women 's hospital , boston , usa .\nimr image size is 256  256  60 voxels , and voxel size is 0.9375  0.9375  2.5  mm ) .\ntwo patient cases , each including five imr images , are treated to illustrate our modeling and brain shift followed by successive resections . in both cases , the 1st imr image was acquired prior to the opening of the skull ; the 2nd imr image was acquired after the opening of the skull and dura , and shows some brain shift ; the 3rd , 4th , and 5th imr images were acquired after successive resections .\nthe modelings of brain shift , 1st , 2nd , and 3rd resection are performed using different techniques , as detailed below . except where otherwise noted\n, the following discussion applies to both patient cases ( the result of each deformation modeling is shown for the two patient cases at the end of section 5.2.3 ) . to model brain shift based on the 1st and 2nd imr images\n, we estimate the surface displacement fields of the whole - brain region boundary and the internal tumor region boundary from the two imr images .\nno tissue discontinuity is involved in the brain shift deformation , so the biomechanical model is deformed using fem .\nthis results in the volume displacement field of the biomechanical model , which is illustrated in figure 3 for the first patient case .\nthis volume displacement field is used to warp the part of the 1st imr image corresponding to the whole - brain region . in the following sections ,\nthe three successive resections are modeled separately , because they require different types of processing .\nmatching two region boundaries to get a displacement field makes sense only if they correspond to the same physical entity .\nonce the resection has started , we can no longer rely on the entirety of the whole - brain region boundary , since a part of it is now missing . for modeling the successive resections , we thus evaluate the displacement field for the boundary of the healthy - brain region only .\nthe 1st resection occurs between the times the 2nd and 3rd imr images are acquired .\nhowever , since the corresponding removal of tissues is most likely accompanied by deformation , one can not exactly determine what tissue is removed based just on the two imr images .\nwe thus decided to model the 1st resection by still relying on the displacement fields of key surfaces , here the healthy - brain region boundary , to deform the biomechanical model .\nthis indeed appears to be the only reliable information concerning the deformation due to resection that we can extract from the 2nd and 3rd imr images .\nconsequently , we do not model explicitly the removal of tissue , but we model directly the deformation resulting from it , without introducing any tissue discontinuity . using the surface displacement field of the healthy - brain region boundary , we compute the deformation of the biomechanical model via fem . then , using the resulting volume displacement field , we warp the part of the 2nd imr image corresponding to the whole - brain region , in the same way as we did in the case of for brain shift .\nthe image resulting from the 1st resection modeling is now registered to the 3rd imr image , except outside of the healthy - brain region boundary , that is , for the tumor region . finally , we alter the resulting image to reflect the effect of resection . for this\n, we assign the background color to the voxels corresponding to the resected tissue volume \nthe significant feature of the 2nd resection is that some tissue has already been removed by the 1st resection , which means that this tissue can not have any physical influence on subsequent brain deformations because it does not \nrecall that the biomechanical model has been deformed to model the brain shift and the 1st resection and is thus registered to the 3rd imr image .\nso , using the 3rd imr image , we can define the boundary of the 1st resection , that is , the tissue discontinuity to include in the deformed biomechanical model ( figures 4(a ) and 4(b ) ) .\nwe then enrich the nodes whose supports are intersected by the discontinuity with heaviside dofs .\nconsequently , when the xfem - based biomechanical model deforms , the part corresponding to tissue removed by the 1st resection has no influence on the deformation of the remaining part of the brain .\nfor the first patient case illustrated in figure 4 , the tetrahedron mesh consists of 3,317 nodes , which corresponds to 9,951 fem dofs .\nthe biomechanical model is deformed in accordance with the displacement field of the healthy - brain region boundary evaluated from the 3rd and 4th imr images .  \nthe bottom part of the mesh , representing the tissue remaining after the 1st resection , has been deformed according to the displacement field of the healthy - brain region boundary , while the top part , representing the tissue removed by the 1st resection , has been subjected to a translation , but only for visualization purposes . even though the mesh is displayed as two separate parts , it is , in fact , a single entity .\nindeed , a main feature of xfem is its ability to handle the effect of a discontinuity without modifying the underlying mesh , that is , without remeshing . for modeling the 2nd resection , the edges of fes straddling the discontinuity\nhave been made discontinuous and their nodes moved apart . using the xfem volume displacement field , we warp the part of the 3rd imr image corresponding to the whole - brain region .\nthe resulting image is then masked out with the whole - brain region segmented out from the 4th imr image .\none significant feature of the procedure described for modeling the 2nd resection is that it can be applied repetitively for each subsequent resection visible on successive imr images , no matter how many there are .\nthe modeling of the 3rd resection is thus identical to the modeling of the 2nd resection .\nthe tissue discontinuity due to the 2nd resection is defined from the 4th imr image , and used to appropriately enrich the nodes of the biomechanical model .\nthen , this biomechanical model is deformed using xfem , in accordance with the displacement field of the healthy - brain region boundary evaluated from the 4th and 5th imr images . for the first patient case ,\na simplification for the modeling of the 3rd resection can be made because , by the time the 5th imr image is acquired , the resection is complete .\nthis means that we only need to compute the volume displacement field of the healthy - brain region .\nsince we apply displacements exactly to the boundary of the healthy - brain region , the results obtained with fem and xfem will be identical .\nusing the fem ( for the first patient case ) or xfem ( for the second patient case ) volume displacement field , we warp the part of the 4th imr image corresponding to the whole - brain region . the resulting image is then masked out with the whole - brain region segmented out from the 5th imr image .\nfigures 5 and 6 show the results of warping the imr images , as well as the edges extracted from them , after brain shift and each successive resection modeling for the two patient cases . as explained in section 5.2.3 , since we apply displacements exactly to the boundary of the healthy - brain region , the results obtained with fem and xfem are identical in the healthy - brain region .\none can deduce that using xfem for modeling resection is interesting when the neurosurgeon needs to have an accurate displacement field of the remaining tumor tissues . in this case\n, it is interesting to evaluate the impact of using fem , instead of xfem , to model the resection as if no resection was performed before .\nusing fem for modeling resection is equivalent to ignoring the presence of resection on intraoperative images . to illustrate the comparison between fem and xfem results , we choose the 3rd resection modeling of the second patient case\nindeed , it is the deformation with remaining tumor tissues that shows the largest magnitude , and , thus , that is likely to give a maximum difference between the two computations .  \nthe healthy - brain and tumor regions segmented out from the 4th and 5th imr images are respectively shown in figures 7(a ) and 7(b ) .\nthe volume displacement fields of the biomechanical model using xfem and fem are respectively shown in figures 7(c ) and 7(d ) .\nthe part of the 4th imr image corresponding to the whole - brain region is warped , first with the volume displacement field obtained via fem , and then with that obtained via xfem .\nthe difference between the two warped images is shown in figure 7(e ) . as expected\nhowever , the difference between the two volume displacement fields is smaller than the image resolution ( although the difference between the two volume displacement fields is smaller than the image resolution , the difference between the images resulting of the warping using these two volume displacement fields is nonzero .\nthis is explained by the fact that the ( gray ) value of each voxel of the warped image is defined as a weighted - value of voxels of the original image .\nthe weights are defined based on the overlapping ratio of the voxel of the warped image , with voxels ( determined using the volume displacement field ) of the original image ) .\nin addition , the deformed 4th imr images , using the xfem- and the fem - based deformations of the biomechanical model , show the same similarity , computed based on the modified hausdorff distance , with the 5th imr .\ntwo reasons explain that the differences between the fem and xfem results are so small .\nfirst , the brain deformation itself due to the 3rd resection is small , and , thus , it is expected to obtain small differences between the two resulting brain deformations .\nsecond , in the case the remaining tumor tissues are close to the healthy - brain region boundary , it implies that they are close to the boundary where surface displacement fields are applied to drive the deformation of the biomechanical model .\nalthough this comparison between fem and xfem should be done on more patient cases , we suggest that , in first approximation , fem could be used for modeling resection cases with small brain deformations .\nnevertheless , the presentation of the successive resections using xfem shows the generality of our framework , and details how xfem is implemented .\nnote that in section 6 devoted to validation , the warped images are the ones deformed with xfem .\nfor each deformation modeling based on a pair ( ik , ik+1 ) of two successive imr images that are already rigidly registered , we compare the similarity between these ik and ik+1 images , as well as the similarity between the ik and ik+1 images , where ik is the result of warping ik .\nthis gives us an estimate of how well we are able to capture , and compensate for , the local deformations between ik and ik+1 .\nthe goal of the nonrigid registration is , however , to deform the preoperative images . by warping ik for each deformation modeling\n, we do not take into account the fact that an error of alignment after each deformation modeling could propagate and amplify through the successive deformation modelings . to evaluate the effect of this error amplification on the results\n, we also perform the required succession of warpings on i1 , and we denote the resulting image by i1,k .\nwe then compare , for each deformation modeling , the similarity between i1 and ik+1 , together with the similarity between i1,k and ik+1 .\nthis allows one to evaluate the propagation , that is , the amplification , of alignment error on the results .\nthe modified hausdorff distance computed for each pair of imr images are given in tables 1 and 2 . \n\ntable 1 shows , for each deformation modeling based on a pair ( ik , ik+1 ) of two successive imr images , the values of the modified hausdorff distances (ik , ik+1 ) and (ik , ik+1 ) .\nthese values are computed using the canny edges extracted from the pair of images ( ik , ik+1 ) ( figures 5 ( d ) and 6 ( d ) ) and ( ik , ik+1 ) ( figures 5 ( e ) and 6 ( e ) ) .\nwe observe that the values for the images nonrigidly registered are relatively constant , that is , 1  mm , for each deformation modeling .\nsix out of eight deformation modelings give smaller modified hausdorff distances when the imr images are ( rigidly and subsequently ) nonrigidly registered .\nhowever , the modified hausdorff distance increases for the 3rd resection modeling of the first patient case , as well as for the brain shift modeling of the second patient case . to understand\nif the nonrigid registration is responsible for the increase of the misalignment of the two imr images everywhere in the whole - brain region , or if this effect is localized , we compute the modified hausdorff distance in the region and neighborhood of the tumor only ( volume region that extents by 25  mm the tumor region segmented in i1 for both patient cases ) .\nthe modified hausdorff distance decreases from (i4 , i5 ) = 1.70  mm to (i4 , i5 ) = 1.37  mm for the first patient case , while it decreases from (i1 , i2 ) = 1.36  mm to (i1 , i2 ) = 1.28  mm for the second patient case .\nthis indicates that the nonrigid registration enhances the alignment of the two imr images within the tumor region and its neighborhood , which is in fact the location requiring the best modeling accuracy .\nthis behavior could be explained by the fact that a maximum of information from the imr images is used in this region , that is , one or two ( in case of brain shift modeling ) surface displacement fields are applied around it .\nthe increase of misalignment elsewhere in the brain volume could be explained by two reasons .\nfirst , the landmarks tracked from the imr images are surfaces . as a consequence , the nonrigid registration is expected to give better results near the tracked surfaces than far from them in the volume .\nthe volume misalignment could point out the need for better parameters values and/or other constitutive laws . \n\ntable 2 shows , for each deformation modeling based on a pair ( ik , ik+1 ) of two successive imr images , the values of the modified hausdorff distances (i1 , ik+1 ) and (i1,k , ik+1 ) .\nso far , igns systems allow one to rigidly register preoperative and successive imr images .\n(i1 , ik+1 ) thus represents the navigation accuracy that we can obtain with an igns system at the present time .\nthe comparison of (i1 , ik+1 ) with (i1,k , ik+1 ) gives the improvement that could be practically achieved in the alignment with our approach .\nas expected , table 2 shows that the igns accuracy decreases through the successive deformations .\nindeed , the modified hausdorff distance increases from (i1 , i2 ) = 1.24  mm to (i1 , i5 ) = 1.78  mm for the first patient case , and from (i1 , i2 ) = 1.01  mm to (i1 , i5 ) = 1.68  mm for the second patient case .\nsix out of eight deformation modelings give smaller modified hausdorff distances when the imr images are nonrigidly registered .\nto understand if the modified hausdorff distance increases everywhere in the whole - brain region for the brain shift and 1st resection modeling of the second patient case , we compute the modified hausdorff distance in the neighborhood of the tumor region ( in the same way as explained for table 1 ) , and observe the improvement of the alignment within the tumor region and its neighborhood . as opposed to the values of the modified hausdorff distances in table 1 , the values for the images nonrigidly registered in table 2 increase through the successive resection modeling .\nthis amplification error is due to the fact that , after having modeled brain deformation between a pair of imr images , the deformed biomechanical model is not in perfect alignment with the second image of the pair .\nsince , for the subsequent deformation modeling , the surface landmarks are initialized based on the deformed biomechanical model , this can thus ampliy a misregistration error .\nwe developed a complete 3d framework for serial preoperative image update in the presence of brain shift followed by successive resections .\nthe nonrigid registration technique used an homogeneous linear elastic biomechanical model , driven by the deformations of whole - brain and internal tumor region boundaries for brain shift modeling , and healthy - brain region boundary for resection modelings , tracked between successive imr images .\nthe biomechanical model was deformed using fem for brain shift modeling , and fem or xfem for resection modeling , depending upon whether some brain tissues were previously resected or not .\nwe showed that our approach was modular , and could be applied each time a new imr image is acquired .\nwe used a linear formulation to characterize the deformation of the brains of both patients because the brains underwent relatively small deformations and displacements .\nwhile nonlinear biomechanical models have proven effective to decrease  yet do not abolish  the inaccuracies of fem - based modeling methods of large brain deformations , the deformations observed in our patients during surgery remained moderate ( 47  mm ) , thus reducing the theoretical benefit of using nonlinear models .\nthis allowed us to use simpler linear models and focus on the added value of xfem to simultaneously account for surgical deformations , namely , shift and resection . using a linear formulation\nimplied that , for each new deformation modeling , one could use the initial configuration rather than the last - deformed configuration of the biomechanical model .\nthis had the important advantage of using a good quality mesh for each deformation modeling rather than using a mesh whose quality progressively degraded with each successive deformation modeling .\nthis also had the advantage that we did no longer need to reconnect the deformed mesh for each new xfem calculation , which was one drawback of our previous method , presented in [ 39 , 41 ] , where the biomechanical model was successively deformed .\nwe also showed how xfem could handle a discontinuity for modeling resection without any remeshing or mesh adaptation while the representation of the discontinuity remained accurate , that is , the representation of the discontinuity was not based on a jagged topology using fe facets .\nxfem thus also avoided making the mesh resolution richer in the neighborhood of the resection - cavity boundary for improving the accuracy of the representation of the discontinuity for that purpose only .\nwe showed that our nonrigid registration technique improved the alignment of the successive imr images for most of the deformation modeling of both patient cases . when our nonrigid registration failed , it still improved the alignment locally , that is , within the tumor region and its neighborhood .\nwe tested the explicit modeling of the lateral ventricles ' region with a soft , compressible law in addition to the whole - brain region law used in the homogeneous biomechanical model .\nin addition to the validation that is usually performed for successive deformation modelings , that is , validation between pairs of successive intraoperative images , shown in table 1 of section 6 or in the work of ferrant et al .\n[ 13 , 47 , 48 ] , we also evaluated the fact that an error of alignment after each deformation modeling could propagate and amplify through the successive deformation modelings . as a result , shown in table 2 of section 6\n, we showed that our approach suffered from the propagation of misregistration through the successive deformation modelings .\nwe expected that this was due , at least partly , to the algorithms used to evaluate intraoperative surface displacements fields from the whole - brain and healthy - brain region boundaries .\nthe surface displacement fields were computed using active surface algorithms , and smoothed to make them compatible with the biomechanical model .\nbecause of these two smoothings , the deformed biomechanical model was likely to not be in a perfect alignment with the imr image to which it was registered .\nbecause the surface displacement fields evaluated for the next deformation modeling were initialized based on the deformed biomechanical model , we expected to observe an amplification of the misregistration , which was confirmed by our quantitative evaluation . at the present time\nthough , commercial igns systems allow one to register preoperative images and successive imr images , but in a rigid way only .\nconsequently , although the effect of error amplification exists , our technique still enhances the current capabilities of commercial igns systems .\nfuture work on modeling of brain shift followed by successive resection is required in five main areas .\nfirst , the effect of error amplification through the successive brain deformation modelings calls for further research .\nconsequently , the segmentation , and the subsequent smoothing , as well as the evaluation of surface displacement fields , should be improved to minimize the effect of error amplification .\nsecond , further research is required to include additional structures in the biomechanical model in general , and to study the best way to include the lateral ventricles in particular .\nthe use of a poroelastic model in order to model the cerebrospinal fluid filling the ventricles could be considered [ 17 , 18 ] .\nindeed , these images provide volume information ( rather than surface information only ) , are of good quality in comparison to other intraoperative modalities , and possess a field of view that includes the full volume of brain tissues ( for the 0.5 tesla ge signa scanner ) .\nthese images thus allow one to evaluate what , and how , new structures of the brain could be used , to enhance the modeling of brain shift .\nsome regions , for example , the lateral ventricles ' region , could be extracted from the two imr images , and used as surface landmarks to drive the deformation of the biomechanical model [ 13 , 62 ] . indeed , the workflow presented in this paper has the advantage of being easily adaptable . in case\nthe tumor region would not be visible ( enough ) on the imr images , these new structures , easier to segment , could also adequately replace the tumor for driving the deformation .\nfourth , our global approach should no longer be based on the 1st imr image used as a substitute for preoperative images , but on the preoperative images themselves .\nfifth , we should implement , for the surgery cases involving large deformations of the brain , a nonlinear formulation of fem [ 63 , 64 ] , and , particularly , a nonlinear formulation of xfem , which is the subject of recent research [ 65 , 66 ] ."}

tumor actions that affect the essential alterations that dictate malignant growth in a number of studies.10 a diet rich in n-3 pufa may protect from cancer , at least at certain sites .\nstudies on the fatty acid status of patients with several cancer types including bladder , pancreatic , lung and esophageal cancer show low concentrations of plasma phospholipid n-3 pufa , ranging from 55 to 88% of amounts in healthy individuals.1113 recent studies have found a positive association between n-6 pufa and cancer risk , whereas in the same model , n-3 pufa were shown to reduce the development of cancer .\nepidemiological studies suggest that a high n-3 pufa to n-6 pufa ratio may be the optimal strategy to decrease breast cancer risk.14 solid epidemiological study shows that consumption of n-3 pufa appears to protect against the development of hepatocellular carcinoma , even among patients with hepatitis b virus ( hbv ) and/or hepatitis c virus ( hcv ) infection.15 recently , zhennan et al .\nhas reviewed prospective studies investigating the possible protective effects of the dietary intake of n-3 pufa on prostate cancer development.16 fasano et al also has reviewed a lot of in vivo and in vitro experimental studies providing strong indications of the anti - tumor action of n-3 pufa against lung cancer.17 the purpose of this review is to discuss the potential role of n-3 pufa in gastrointestinal ( gi ) cancer development .\nwe believe that increased consumption of n-3 pufa may lower the risk of gi cancer development via various chemopreventive activities .\nfuture studies should include combination treatment of n-3 pufa and nutrients with different and complementary mechanisms of chemopreventive action .\namong various cancers , most of the gi cancers including esophageal cancer , stomach cancer , and colon cancer , have a natural history of multi - step transition from precursor lesions to malignant lesions , inflammation , adenoma formation , dysplastic changes.18 therefore , gi cancers usually have premalignant lesions before developing invasive cancers , for instances , barrett s esophagus for esophageal cancer , chronic atrophic gastritis accompanied with intestinal metaplasia for gastric cancer , and adenoma or dysplasia originating from chronic ulcerative colitis for colon cancer .\nbecause the western diet contains disproportionally high amounts of n-6 pufa and low amounts of n-3 pufa , denoted as a high n-6 to n-3 pufa ratio , n-3 pufa may feasibly play a role in several stages of gi cancers management .\nesophageal cancer is ranked as the sixth leading cause of cancer death worldwide . according to the increasing incidence of gastroesophageal reflux disease ( gerd ) ,\nesophageal cancer is a tumor that has increased in incidence more than 7-fold over the past several decades .\nsuggests that negative associations between n-3 pufa intake and the risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma.19 higher in -

fat intakes were associated with increased risk ( or=1.11 ; 95% ci=1.031.21 per g / day ) .\nmoreover , it is reported that n-3 pufa supplemented parenteral nutrition can reduce inflammation and improve immune function in patients following esophageal cancer surgery20 and n-3 pufa - containing diet may be beneficial to patients with esophageal cancers who receive chemoradiation therapy ( crt ) by reducing crt toxicity.21 in contrast to other gi cancer , little work has so far been performed on the influence of n-3 pufa in oesophageal adenocarcinogenesis and neoplastic progression.22 there is a need for appropriately powered randomized - controlled studies to assess the long - term benefit of n-3 pufa . gastric cancer ( gc ) is the fourth most common cancer worldwide , and almost two thirds of affected individuals will die of their disease .\nsome studies about the association of n-3 pufa and gastric disease suggests a protective effect of n-3 pufa on gastric cancer .\nrecently , correa et al . suggests that docosahexanoic acid ( dha ) inhibits helicobacter pylori ( h. pylori ) growth in vitro and mice gastric mucosa colonization.23 \n h. pylori are recognized as a major etiological factor in chronic active gastritis , gastric duodenal ulcers and gastric cancer .\nit has been proposed that pufa hold an inhibitory effect on bacterial growth via disruption of cell membrane leading to bacteria lysis.24 mohamed also shows that n-3 pufa reduced iodoacetamide - induced gastritis in rats through decrease of malondialdehyde ( mda ) , gastrin , and nitric oxide ( no ) and normalization of mucosal glutathione.25 especially , it is reported that the erythrocyte composition of dha was found to be negatively linked to risk of gastric cancer , of well - differentiated adenocarcinoma.26 application of a diet enriched with n-3 pufa delayed tumor growth in a mouse xenograft model.27 \n in vitro studies have shown that n-3 pufa inhibited macrophage - enhanced gastric cancer cell migration and attenuated matrix metalloproteinase ( mmp)-10 expression through erk and stat3 phosphorylation28 and inhibited the growth of human gastric carcinoma cell via apoptosis and combination with 5-fluorouracil has synergetic effect in inhibiting the proliferation of gastric cancer cells.29 moreover , n-3 pufa are beneficial for preventing oxidative stress - induced apoptosis by inhibiting apoptotic gene expression and dna fragmentation of gastric epithelial cells.30 on the other hand , dha induced apoptosis of gastric cancer cells by inducing the expression of apoptotic genes in gastric cancer cells.31 although a large body of literature spanning numerous cohorts from many countries and with different demographic characteristics does not provide evidence to suggest a significant association between n-3 pufa and stomach cancer incidence,32 further studies are needed to investigate action of n-3 pufa relevant to antitumor effects in the stomach .\ncolorectal cancer ( crc ) is the second leading cause of cancer -

tumor actions .\ncurrent knowledge of the anti - tumor activity of n-3 pufa has been comprehensively reviewed elsewhere.9,16,39 recently , stephenson et al.10 has reviewed more recent underlying mechanisms providing strong indications of the anti - tumor actions of n-3 pufa on the hallmarks of cancer .\nn-3 pufa appear to down - regulate epidermal growth factor receptor ( egfr ) , protein kinase c ( pkc ) , ras , and nf-b , insulin like growth factor ( igf ) , which are important cell signaling mediators often found to be elevated in carcinogenesis .\nsecondly , n-3 pufa induces cancer cell apoptosis via modulation of peroxisome proliferator - activated receptors ( ppars ) , the bcl-2 family , and nf-b cell signaling .\nthirdly , n-3 pufa decreases sprouting angiogenesis by suppressing vascular endothelial growth factor ( vegf)- and platelet derived growth factor ( pdgf)-stimulated endothelial cell proliferation , migration , and tube formation and by inhibition of mmps via no production and nf-b and -catenin cell signaling .\nfourthly , n-3 pufa also decreases cell - cell adhesion via down regulation of rho - gtpase , which inhibits cytoskeleton reorganisation , and reduction in intercellular adhesion molecule ( icam)-1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule ( vcam)-1 expression .\ncockbain et al.9 has also proposed the four main anti - tumor actions of n-3 pufa ( i ) modulation of cox activity ; ( ii ) alteration of membrane dynamics and cell surface receptor function ; ( iii ) increased cellular oxidative stress and ( iiii ) derived anti - inflammatory lipid mediators .\nfirstly , n-3 pufa can act as an alternative substrate for cox-2 , instead of aa , leading to a reduction in formation of pro - tumorigenic \nsecondly , incorporation of n-3 pufa into cell membranes alters the fluidity , structure and/or function of lipid rafts or calveolae .\nespecially , the localization of cell surface receptors , such as g protein - coupled receptors ( gpcrs ) , toll - like receptors ( tlrs ) , and epidermal growth factor receptor ( egfr ) , in lipid rafts is believed to be crucial for downstream receptor signaling , controlling proliferation and apoptosis .\nthirdly , n-3 pufa may have an anti - tumor effect through alteration in the cellular redox state .\nn-3 pufa can increase reactive oxygen species ( ros ) because it is highly peroxidisable .\ntherefore , n-3 pufa can induce cancer cell apoptosis via elevation of intracellular ros levels .\nfourthly , n-3 pufa can be metabolized novel anti - inflammatory lipid mediators including resolvins , protectins and maresins .\nit is known that resolvins exhibit antineoplastic activity via anti - inflammatory and inflammation resolution activity in animal models of acute inflammation . besides these multiple anti - tumor actions\n, it is also reported recently that n-3 pufa can activate nrf2 and induced nrf2-directed gene expression40,41 and can suppress lipopolysaccharide - induced inflammation through induction of nrf2 expression.42 nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 ( nrf2 ) is a redox - sensitive master regulatory transcriptional factor that plays an important protective role in cells by regulating cellular redox balance.43 moreover , n-3 pufa significantly reduces oxidative stress - induced endothelial cell ca influx .\nthis effect might be associated , at least in part , with altered lipid composition in membrane lipid rafts.44 recently , the engineered n-3 pufa desaturase transgenic mice ( fat-1 mice ) , which can endogenously synthesize n-3 pufa in their tissues , allows carefully controlled studies to be performed in the absence of potential confounding dietary factors.45 the synthesis of n-3 pufa is achieved through the expression of the fat-1 transgene encoding for an n-3 desaturase , which utilizes n-6 pufa as substrate .\nthis allows production of high n-3/n-6 ratios in the animals , thus eliminating the potential diet variations .\nhence , the fat-1 transgenic mouse is a valuable in vivo system for elucidating the role of n-3 pufa in carcinogenesis .\nsince fat-1 mice were generated , xia et al.46 showed that melanoma formation and growth are reduced in fat-1 transgenic mice .\nnowak and jia47,48 reported that lower incidence and growth rate of colon tumors induced by dss ( dextrane sodium sulfate ) plus aom ( azoxymethane ) in the fat-1 transgenic mice via its anti - inflammatory properties .\nsong et al.49 also reported that the growth of pancreatic cancer in vivo was significantly reduced when mouse pancreatic cancer cells , panc02 cells , were inoculated into the fat-1 transgenic mice .\nrecently , mohammed et al.50 suggested the beneficial effects of n-3 pufa for chemoprevention of pancreatic cancer using fat-1 mice .\nthey generated compound fat-1-kras transgenic mice and showed a dramatic reduction in incidence of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma ( 84% ; p<0.02 ) in fat-1-kras mice compared to kras mice . besides of gi cancers ,\nthe growth of hepatocellular carcinoma ( hcc ) in vivo was significantly reduced in the fat-1 transgenic mice.5153 mice expressing mmtv - neu(ndl)-yd5 and fat-1 , which were bred with mouse mammary tumor virus ( mmtv)-neu(ndl)-yd5 mice ( an aggressive breast cancer model ) , displayed significant ( p<0.05 ) reductions in tumor volume ( 30% ) and multiplicity ( 33%).54 recently , in our laboratory an in vivo study has shown a suppressive effect of fat-1 mice in gi cancer development ( unpublished data ) .\nfat-1 mice were bred with the apc mouse colon cancer transgenic mice to generate compound fat-1-apc transgenic mice .\na dramatic reduction in incidence of aom - dss induced colon adenocarcinoma in fat-1-apc mice compared to apc mice was shown . moreover , in the case of stomach cancer development , h. pylori initiated- , salt diet - promoted - gastric tumor was also reduced in fat-1 mice . in conclusion , several studies using fat-1 mice model indicate that balancing the tissue n-6/n-3 ratio could exert a significant effect on gi cancer development .\nthe fat-1 mouse model allows carefully controlled studies to be performed in the absence of restricted diets , which can create confounding factors that limit studies of this nature.55\nrecently , the engineered n-3 pufa desaturase transgenic mice ( fat-1 mice ) , which can endogenously synthesize n-3 pufa in their tissues , allows carefully controlled studies to be performed in the absence of potential confounding dietary factors.45 the synthesis of n-3 pufa is achieved through the expression of the fat-1 transgene encoding for an n-3 desaturase , which utilizes n-6 pufa as substrate .\nthis allows production of high n-3/n-6 ratios in the animals , thus eliminating the potential diet variations .\nhence , the fat-1 transgenic mouse is a valuable in vivo system for elucidating the role of n-3 pufa in carcinogenesis .\nsince fat-1 mice were generated , xia et al.46 showed that melanoma formation and growth are reduced in fat-1 transgenic mice .\nnowak and jia47,48 reported that lower incidence and growth rate of colon tumors induced by dss ( dextrane sodium sulfate ) plus aom ( azoxymethane ) in the fat-1 transgenic mice via its anti -

risk patients via various mechanisms mediating cancer prevention by n-3 pufa ( fig .\n2 ) . in addition , using n-3 pufa in combination with other agents with complementary antitumor action may improve their efficacy in gi cancer prevention . recently ,\nmanson et al . has started the vitamin d and omega-3 trial ( vital ) , a large randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled , 22 factorial trial of vitamin d and n-3 pufa supplements in the primary prevention of cancer among a multi - ethnic population of 20,000 u.s .\nmen aged 50 and women aged 55.56 we expect that new findings in combination consumption of n-3 pufa with other nutrients will provide new approaches to public health implications with regard to prevention of gi cancer through dietary and lifestyle interventions ."}

transfer of distraction forces to ac ligaments after fracture union may then induce gradual subluxation of this joint .\nthis complication was rare in the other group , probably due to the joint spanning implant design ; however , other radiological abnormalities like hook migration , subacromial osteolysis , implant loosening , and new bone formation were frequent .\nthe acromioclavicular joint spanning hook plate is a commonly used implant , and most studies have utilized this as the sole implant of choice .\nalthough clinical outcomes in these studies have been satisfactory , the effect of the subacromial hook on bursal tissues has been debated and use of the distal clavicle plate suggested . by using ultrasonographic evaluation , this study demonstrated the safety of the joint - spanning hook plate in relation to rotator cuff and subacromial bursa .\npersistent pain in the post - operative period probably resulted from acromial undersurface irritation ; early plate removal after fracture union is recommended , and long - term clinical outcomes seem to be satisfactory after implant removal .\nan important finding of this study is the grouping of the radiographic fracture patterns into four surgically relevant types .\ntypes 1 and 2 are ideal indications for use of a joint - sparing implant ; adequate bone stock in the distal fragment in these types will theoretically permit secure fixation across the fracture site . in types 3 and 4\n, inadequate distal fragment size may not permit secure bicortical fixation , thereby necessitating use of joint - spanning implants .\n. the retrospective nature and small sample size does not permit identification of all possible fracture configurations , and statistical analysis may differ with larger numbers .\nhowever , the clinical results are similar to other literature studies that have analyzed joint - spanning implants . also , the current radiographic patterns described provide guidelines for implant choice , and are not intended to be used as a prognostic classification .\nwe attribute the small size of the study group to the stringent inclusion and exclusion criteria that eliminated several other patients with lateral clavicle fractures , and this was necessary to obtain meaningful conclusions\n. lateral clavicle fractures with complete disruption of the coracoclavicular ligaments should be regarded as a distinct entity that is perhaps biomechanically and prognostically different from similar fractures with partial ligament disruption .\na combination of a locking distal radius plate with coracoclavicular ligament reconstruction resulted in stable fixation and significantly lower reoperation rates , and should be used preferentially in lesser comminuted fractures ( types 1 and 2 ) ."}
